in
this
final
rule
,
based
upon
the
record
evidence
,
osha
is
adopting
certain
regulatory
recommendations
made
in
the
earlier
rulemaking
,
is
rejecting
other
recommendations
,
and
is
issuing
other
provisions
which
are
based
on
,
but
are
altered
versions
of
yet
other
recommendations
in
the
earlier
rulemaking
.
in
addition
,
new
,
different
and
expanded
provisions
also
have
been
urged
for
adoption
by
participants
in
this
rulemaking
.
these
participants
represent
labor
,
public
interest
and
industry
interests
.
the
agency
is
adopting
,
rejecting
and
changing
these
recommendations
as
well
.
a
large
portion
of
this
preamble
is
devoted
to
the
agencys
explanations
of
these
regulatory
decisions
.
osha
believes
that
its
reasons
when
it
has
adopted
or
has
not
adopted
recommended
provisions
are
well
supported
by
the
evidence
and
that
the
reasons
for
its
choices
are
stronger
than
the
contrary
arguments
.
in
general
,
osha
believes
that
the
extent
of
its
burden
to
refute
claims
of
benefit
for
a
recommended
provision
depends
on
the
extent
of
the
supporting
data
.
if
the
data
are
valid
and
extensive
,
oshas
burden
is
greater
.
if
however
,
the
claim
of
benefit
is
based
on
opinion
,
refutation
by
osha
need
not
be
grounded
in
data
,
but
may
be
based
on
oshas
well
reasoned
and
expert
contrary
opinion
.
in
sum
,
oshas
decision
not
to
adopt
recommended
provisions
to
reduce
asbestos
related
risk
reflects
the
agencys
expert
judgment
,
often
where
available
data
creates
considerable
uncertainty
,
that
the
provisions
would
not
offer
more
than
de
minimis
benefit
in
reducing
a
still
significant
risk
.
many
recommendations
were
unsupported
by
data
showing
benefit
.
for
example
,
it
was
recommended
to
prohibit
high
speed
burnishing
of
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
floor
tile
.
however
,
the
data
do
not
show
a
measurable
reduction
of
airborne
asbestos
fiber
levels
,
based
on
actual
fiber
counts
using
such
practices
.
other
recommended
provisions
simply
do
not
reduce
a
still
significant
risk
.
for
example
,
requiring
very
low
clearance
samples
(
analyzed
by
transmission
electron
microscopy
)
to
deregulate
all
`
regulated
areas
'
to
assure
that
epa
ahera
level
of
0
01
f
cc
is
met
does
not
appear
to
be
necessary
to
reduce
a
significant
risk
to
employees
.
there
is
an
extremely
low
(
although
speculative
)
risk
of
asbestos
related
disease
estimated
at
such
clearance
levels
,
and
,
there
is
evidence
that
immediate
clearance
sampling
does
not
predict
later
concentration
levels
.
