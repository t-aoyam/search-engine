in
reviewing
the
data
collected
by
the
epa
from
industry
,
industry
representatives
expressed
concern
that
control
devices
were
`
overrepresented
over
represented
'
in
the
epas
data
base
,
which
indicated
approximately
5
percent
of
major
sources
were
equipped
with
control
devices
.
industry
felt
that
they
knew
of
each
control
device
used
by
the
industry
and
based
on
their
knowledge
,
they
believed
no
more
than
1
percent
of
major
sources
were
equipped
with
control
devices
.
the
committee
agreed
that
approximately
1
percent
of
the
major
sources
are
equipped
with
control
devices
.
while
the
act
states
that
the
mact
floor
analysis
shall
be
based
on
sources
for
which
the
administrator
has
emissions
information
,
this
does
not
mean
epa
should
not
use
the
information
it
has
appropriately
.
given
that
the
committee
believed
that
control
devices
were
overrepresented
represented
in
epas
data
base
,
the
epa
concluded
that
the
mact
floor
should
be
calculated
from
a
population
of
facilities
that
includes
only
1
(
instead
of
4
)
control
device
(
equivalent
to
1
percent
of
the
major
sources
in
the
data
base
.
the
agency
specifically
requests
comments
on
this
decision
.
any
supporting
data
that
would
justify
additional
sources
or
fewer
sources
with
control
devices
being
included
in
the
mact
floor
analysis
would
be
welcomed
.
using
the
approaches
described
above
,
the
average
hap
emission
level
achieved
by
the
best
performing
12
percent
of
existing
sources
was
determined
to
be
1
lb
hap
lb
solids
(
1
kg
hap
kg
solids
,
as
applied
.
as
discussed
in
ivd
,
the
format
of
the
emission
limitation
was
later
changed
to
kilograms
of
volatile
hap
per
kilogram
of
solids
,
as
applied
,
(
kg
vhap
kg
solids
[
lb
vhap
lb
solids
]
as
applied
.
therefore
,
the
mact
floor
for
existing
sources
is
1
kg
vhap
kg
solids
(
1
lb
vhap
lb
solids
,
as
applied
.
the
epa
is
considering
two
possible
meanings
for
the
word
`
average
'
as
the
term
is
used
above
in
relation
to
determining
the
mact
floor
.
first
,
`
average
'
could
be
interpreted
as
the
arithmetic
mean
.
the
arithmetic
mean
of
a
set
of
measurements
is
the
sum
of
the
measurements
divided
by
the
number
of
measurements
in
the
set
.
the
epa
has
determined
that
the
arithmetic
mean
of
the
emissions
limitations
achieved
by
the
best
performing
12
percent
of
existing
sources
would
yield
,
in
some
cases
,
an
emission
limitation
that
fails
to
correspond
to
the
limitation
achieved
by
any
particular
technology
.
in
such
cases
,
the
epa
would
not
select
this
approach
.
the
word
`
average
'
could
also
be
interpreted
as
the
median
emission
limitation
value
.
the
median
is
the
value
in
a
set
of
measurements
arranged
in
order
of
magnitude
below
and
above
which
there
are
an
equal
number
of
values
(
ie
,
it
is
the
middle
value
.
this
approach
identifies
the
emission
limitation
achieved
by
those
sources
within
the
top
12
percent
,
arranges
those
emission
limitations
by
magnitude
,
and
takes
the
control
level
achieved
by
the
median
source
.
this
is
mathematically
equivalent
to
identifying
the
emission
limitation
achieved
by
the
source
at
the
94th
percentile
level
of
emission
control
.
either
of
these
two
approaches
could
be
used
in
developing
standards
for
different
source
categories
.
in
determining
the
mact
floor
for
this
source
category
,
the
committee
used
the
approach
that
interprets
the
average
as
the
arithmetic
mean
.
the
median
approach
is
not
feasible
for
the
proposed
standards
because
it
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
having
proportional
representation
of
each
industry
segment
.
the
median
approach
would
select
the
level
of
control
achieved
by
one
facility
,
the
one
at
the
94th
percentile
,
and
would
only
represent
one
industry
segment
.
in
addition
,
the
arithmetic
mean
represents
a
technically
achievable
emission
limitation
for
this
industry
.
of
the
11
facilities
in
the
floor
,
two
have
an
emission
limit
of
1
lb
vhap
lb
solids
.
a
range
of
options
can
be
used
to
meet
the
1
lb
vhap
lb
solids
limit
;
the
limit
does
not
require
the
use
of
either
a
specific
technology
or
a
limited
set
of
technologies
.
the
epa
specifically
solicits
comments
on
its
interpretation
of
average
in
general
,
and
the
use
of
an
arithmetic
mean
for
this
rule
specifically
.
