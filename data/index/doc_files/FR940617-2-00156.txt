offerings
without

french
law
permits
an
issuer
,
when
it
is
authorized
by
its
shareholders
,
to
issue
shares
(
or
securities
exchangeable
for
,
or
convertible
into
,
shares
)
without
preemptive
emptive
rights
.
in
this
case
,
the
law
limits
the
discount
at
which
the
issuer
may
offer
the
shares
from
the
stock
market
price
.

the
issue
price
must
be
at
least
equal
to
the
average
of
the
stock
market
prices
for
any
20
consecutive
business
days
during
the
40day

period
immediately
preceding
the
date
of
the
offering
(
the
`
20/40
rule
.
the
20/40
rule
protects
shareholders
to
the
extent
that
it
limits
the
discount
that
can
be
set
for
an
offering
of
shares
without
preemptive
emptive
rights
.
in
addition
,
the
cob
has
recommended
a
priority
period
in
the
case
of
an
offering
without
preemptive
emptive
rights
,
permitting
current
shareholders
to
subscribe
for
new
shares
on
a
priority
basis
.
this
period
provides
existing
shareholders
the
ability
to
maintain
their
shareholding
in
the
capital
of
a
company
of
which
they
are
shareholders
,
even
if
they
have
waived
their
preemptive
emptive
rights
.
the
practice
of
the
priority
period
has
been
widely
followed
for
offerings
without
preemptive
emptive
rights
;
offerings
without
a
priority
period
are
rare
today
in
france
(

or

year

of

of

companies
.
<

the
20/40
rule
applies
,
according
to
the
text
of
the
law
,
only
to
straight
share
offerings
;
however
,
to
avoid
circumvention
of
the
law
,
the
cob
requires
that
the
20/40
rule
be
applied
in
the
case
of
offerings
of
convertible
bonds
or
warrants
.
in
applying
the
20/40
rule
,
issuers
generally
choose
a
reference
period
that
is
close
to
the
offering
date
in
order
to
limit
the
amount
of
the
discount
.
in
order
to
facilitate
an
underwritten
offering
in
france
and
or
on
the
international
market
at
the
same
time
as
an
offering
with
a
priority
period
,
the
cob
has
accepted
that
the
priority
period
only
apply
to
a
substantial
part
(
(
ie
,
at
least
two
thirds
)
of
the
offering
.

offerings
without
a
priority
period
offerings
without
a
priority
period
are
extremely
rare
.
such
offerings
are
used
under
very
limited
circumstances
,
such
as
when
an
issuer
needs
to
offer
shares
publicly
on
a
foreign
market
.
such
an
offering
can
only
take
place
if
one
or
both
of
the
following
two
conditions
are
met
:
_
it
must
be
at
the
closest
possible
price
to
the
stock
market
price
;
and
or
_
the
existing
shareholders
are
compensated
,
for
example
in
the
form
of
a
distribution
of
free
shares
or
warrants
.
offerings
without
a
priority
period
will
probably
remain
atypical
,
because
shareholders
generally
want
to
avoid
dilution
through
the
use
of
preemptive
emptive
rights
or
a
priority
period
.

underwritten
offerings
in
the
case
of
offerings
with
a
priority
period
,
an
underwritten
offering
can
occur
during
the
period
when
the
existing
shareholders
have
a
priority
right
to
subscribe
for
new
shares
,
by
anticipating
that
a
fraction
of
the
existing
shareholders
will
not
subscribe
for
new
shares
.
underwritten
offerings
in
france
and
or
on
the
international
market
can
therefore
take
place
during
the
priority
period
granted
to
existing
shareholders
without
extending
the
offering
period
.
in
order
to
accommodate
the
differences
between
the
actual
behavior
of
the
existing
shareholders
and
the
level
of
anticipated
purchases
,
several
techniques
are
used
:
`
clawback
claw
back
'
arrangements
,
overallotment
allotment
options
and
arrangements
whereby
a
majority
shareholder
renounces
his
priority
subscription
rights
.
