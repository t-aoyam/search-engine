waiver
of
proposed
rulemaking
we
ordinarily
publish
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
for
a
regulation
in
the
federal
register
and
provide
a
period
for
public
comment
.
however
,
we
may
waive
that
procedure
if
we
find
good
cause
that
prior
notice
and
comment
are
impracticable
,
unnecessary
,
or
contrary
to
the
public
interest
.
as
noted
earlier
,
this
rule
updates
our
rules
to
properly
reflect
explicit
statutory
requirements
that
are
clear
on
their
face
and
that
we
are
not
interpreting
in
any
way
beyond
their
commonly
understood
meanings
.
without
these
changes
,
certain
regulation
requirements
are
in
conflict
with
the
statute
,
possibly
misleading
those
who
rely
on
our
regulations
.
in
addition
,
some
of
the
statutory
changes
included
in
these
regulations
have
been
enacted
with
retroactive
effective
dates
or
effective
dates
close
to
the
date
of
enactment
of
obra
93
.
under
these
circumstances
,
prompt
publication
of
the
correct
uptodate
to
date
rules
best
serves
those
governed
by
these
regulations
.
because
this
rule
does
not
create
any
legal
requirements
and
because
publishing
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
here
would
perpetuate
conflicts
between
clear
statutory
directives
and
our
regulations
,
we
find
that
publishing
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
before
issuing
this
final
rule
would
be
unnecessary
and
contrary
to
the
public
interest
.
however
,
we
are
providing
a
60day
day
comment
period
for
public
comments
on
the
final
rule
as
indicated
at
the

of

section
1102b
)
of
the
act
requires
the
secretary
to
prepare
a
regulatory
impact
analysis
if
a
final
rule
will
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
operations
of

this
analysis
must
conform
to
the
provisions
of
section
604
of
the
rfa
.
for
purposes
of
section
1102b
)
of
the
act
,
we
define
a
small
rural
hospital
as
a
hospital
that
is
located
outside
of
a
metropolitan
statistical
area
and
has
fewer
than
50
beds
.
this
final
rule

period
updates
our
regulations
to
incorporate
numerous
selfimplementing
self
implementing
statutory
provisions
that
are
not
interrelated
.
none
of
the
regulations
interprets
or
extends
requirements
beyond
those
included
in
the
selfimplementing
self
implementing
legislation

the
amendments
to
which
this
rule
pertains
are
already
in
effect
or
will
go
into
effect
independent
of
the
publication
of
this
rule

consequently
,
there
are
no
actions
to
be
taken
that
would
flow
from
further
analyses
of
the
impact
of
these
provisions
on
entities
.
therefore
,
we
are
not
preparing
analyses
for
either
the
rfa
or
section
1102b
)
of
the
act
since
we
have
determined
,
and
the
secretary
certifies
,
that
this
proposed
rule
would
not
result
in
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small

and
would
not
have
a
