the

although
overall

detected
significant

,
the
individual
results
indicate
that
this
was
primarily
a
quantitative

effect
.
the
comment
maintained
that
the
consistency
of
the
results
was
encouraging
,
considering
that
this
was
the
first
experience
in
reading
the
ipd
response
for
most
of
the
participating
sites
.
the
comment
stated
that
these
data
indicate
that
the
ipd
procedure
can
reliably
discriminate
among
products
that
provide
meaningful

.
the
comment
proposed
using
a

of
20
subjects

and
a
4percent

titanium

product
as
a
control
to

the

proposed
that

three
comments
recommended
using
an
ipd
test
based
upon
two
recent
publications
(
refs
.
22
and
23
.
one
study
(
ref
.
22
)
used
a
xenon
lamp
equipped
with
a
dichroic
mirror
filtered
with
1mm
wg345
,
1mm
wg320
,
and
1mm
ug11
filters
.
the
exposure
increments
were
programmed
in
arithmetic
increments
of
2
joules
per
square
centimeter
(
j
cm2
.
on
protected
skin
,
the
increments
were
3
or
4
j
cm2
.
application
density
of
the
test
sunscreen
products
was
2
milligrams
per
cm2
.
visual
assessment
of
pigmentation
was
done
immediately
after
exposure
and
was
performed
on
the
basis
of
a
homogenous
pigmentation
with
welldefined
well
defined
borders
as
endpoints
.
the
uvapf
uva
pf
is
determined
as
the
ratio
of
minimal
ipd
dose
with
protection
to
the
minimal
ipd
dose
without
protection
.
the
other
study
(
ref
.
23
)
recommends
the
use
of
xenon
or
metal
halide
sources
,
or
a
xenon
metal
halide
combination
,
with
continuous
spectra
restricted
to
the
uva
spectrum
(
320
to
390
nm
)
with
filters
,
such
as
3mm
wg335
and
1mm
ug5
.
six
uva
doses
ranging
from
4
to
about
30
j
cm2
are
applied
in
50
percent
increments
to
subjects
with
skin
types
ii
,
iii
,
and
iv
.
the
study
states
that
with
potential
free
interpolation
,
this
is
actually
a
25percent
percent
progression
.
the
doses
applied
on
the
protected
skin
are
multiplied
by
the
expected
uvapf
uva
pf
of
the
product
under
test
.
observation
of
the
responses
are
delayed
for
at
least
1
hour
,
and
typically
2
hours
,
after
exposure
.
the
study
states
that
results
are
less
variable
if
read
at
2
hours
.
a
simultaneous
determination
of
the
minimal
ipd
doses
on
protected
and
unprotected
skin
is
done
at
the
same
time
in
standard
room
and
illumination
conditions
.
other
parameters

the
test
area
,

of

,

,
selection
of

,
etc
.
follow
the
same
current
standards
as
for
the
spf
determination
.
several
comments
objected
to
the
use
of
the
ipd
testing
method
.
one
comment
stated
that
the
action
spectrum
for
the
ipd
response
is
flat
and
quite
dissimilar
from
the
action
spectrum
for
damage
to
the
skin
from
ultraviolet
light
for
erythema
,
skin
cancer
,
or
photoaging
of
the
skin
.
the
comment
contended
that
the
ipd
response
has
not
been
demonstrated
to
be
a
direct
or
surrogate
endpoint
for
biological
damage
and
,
therefore
,
there
is
no
relationship
between
a
products
ability
to
prevent
ipd
and
to
prevent
damage
to
the
skin
.
the
comment
added
that
ipd
has
been
shown
to
be
unstable
,
variable
,
and
nonlinear
.
another
comment
stated
that
the
ipd
reaction
shows
nonreciprocal
behavior
,
ie
,
the
severity
of
the
reaction
depends
upon
the
time
taken
to
deliver
a
certain
dose
.
one
comment
noted
that
there
are
two
methods
of
assessing
uva
protection
that
are
referred
to
as
ipd
.
the
comment
stated
that
these
two
methods
differ
in
the
amount
of
energy
needed
to
produce
a
response
and
the
time
after
irradiation
at
which
the
endpoint
is
read
.
in
one
method
,
the
response
is
read
at
45
seconds
after
exposure
.
this
response
is
transient
and
has
been
shown
to
be
highly
variable
and
nonreproducible
.
the
response
is
oxygendependent
oxygen
dependent
and
can
only
be
elicited
in
darker
skin
types
.
in
the
second
method
,
the
response
is
read
at
2
to
4
hours
after
exposure
and
uses
a
much
higher
dose
of
uva
.
the
test
causes
a
persistent
pigment
response
in
the
skin
that
may
last
up
to
several
hours
.
the
comment
maintained
that
the
action
spectrum
for
the
persistent
pigment
endpoint
has
been
neither
determined
nor
published
.
