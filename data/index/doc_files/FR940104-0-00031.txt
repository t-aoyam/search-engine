comments
several
comments
requested
that
fda
extend
the
date
that
the
nutrition
labeling
and
nutrient
content
claim
provisions
of
the
act
will
be
applied
to
dietary
supplements
.
most
comments
requested
an
additional
year
,
for
a
total
compliance
period
of
18
months
.
one
comment
proposed
a
delay
of
at
least
9
months
.
the
comments
reported
many
examples
of
the
difficulties
in
meeting
a
6month
month
compliance
period
.
several
comments
stated
that
the
amount
of
time
needed
to
redesign
labels
would
far
exceed
the
resources
available
.
one
comment
reported
that
the
insufficient
time
allowed
to
revise
labels
would
result
in
some
products
being
removed
from
the
market
temporarily
while
new
labels
are
being
prepared
.
an
additional
comment
requested
the
extension
because
of
the
difficulties
in
the
logistics
of
revising
existing
labels
,
printing
,
packaging
,
and
exhausting
existing
label
supplies
with
a
short
compliance
period
.
other
comments
that
requested
a
delay
cited
the
savings
that
could
be
gained
with
insignificant
loss
of
benefits
.
one
comment
reported
that
inventory
disposal
could
be
reduced
by
85
percent
with
an
18month
month
compliance
period
.
another
comment
stated
that
fdas
cost
estimate
of
$
20
million
represents
1
percent
of
industry
sales
but
a
much
larger
percentage
of
industry
profits
.
the
comment
explained
that
extending
the
compliance
period
would
reduce
the
costs
of
compliance
and
,
therefore
,
minimize
any
reduction
in
profits
.
one
comment
requested
a
delay
because
there
will
be
additional
costs
for
compliance
with
the
upcoming
united
states
pharmacopoeia
(
usp
)
standards
.
the
comment
stated
that
resources
could
be
better
spent
if
these
compliance
efforts
were
completed
concurrently
rather
than
consecutively
.
one
comment
requested
a
delay
because
of
the
overlap
with
the
final
months
of
the
extended
period
that
was
allowed
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
the
comment
reported
that
many
conventional
food
manufacturers
and
their
label
suppliers
are
rushing
to
produce
final
labels
for
such
foods
.
the
comment
said
that
supplement
manufacturers
will
not
be
able
to
secure
revised
labels
for
their
products
from
label
manufacturers
in
time
to
meet
a
6month
month
deadline
because
of
the
competition
for
label
manufacturers
'
resources
.
the
agency
agrees
that
it
will
be
difficult
for
dietary
supplement
manufacturers
to
comply
within
6
months
,
especially
in
light
of
the
fact
that
label
suppliers
are
currently
stressed
with
label
orders
from
manufacturers
of
food
in
conventional
food
form
who
are
attempting
to
meet
the
05/19/1994
deadline
for
complying
with
the
1990
amendments
.
the
agency
also
agrees
that
an
extension
of
the
date
of
application
would
result
in
significant
savings
for
the
industry
.
administrative
costs
,
printing
costs
,
and
label
inventory
disposal
costs
are
all
dependent
on
the
length
of
the
compliance
period
.
the
agency
has
determined
that
the
costs
of
the
regulations
could
be
reduced
with
an
extension
.
the
agency
made
a
determination
in
the
date
of
application
final
rule
that
the
1990
amendments
will
result
in
an
undue
economic
hardship
on
manufacturers
of
food
products
in
conventional
food
form
(
58
fr
2070
at
2075
.
the
agency
notes
that
the
costs
of
compliance
for
manufacturers
of
foods
in
conventional
food
form
represent
less
than
1
percent
of
sales
.
the
costs
of
compliance
with
a
6month
month
compliance
period
for
dietary
supplements
is
approximately
2
percent
of
sales
.
therefore
,
if
the
agency
does
not
extend
the
date
of
application
for
dietary
supplement
manufacturers
,
that
segment
of
the
food
industry
will
be
asked
to
bear
higher
relative
costs
than
the
agency
determined
were
reasonable
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
for
all
these
reasons
,
the
agency
determines
that
the
congressionally
mandated
date
of
application
will
result
in
an
undue
economic
hardship
for
dietary
supplement
manufacturers
.
b
.
the
agencys
determination
of
a
date
of
application
of
section
403q
)
and
(
r2
)
of
the
act
as
applied
to
dietary
supplements
the
agency
has
determined
that
undue
economic
hardship
will
result
if
the
dietary
supplement
industry
is
required
to
comply
with
section
403q
)
and
(
r
)
of
the
act
within
6
months
.
as
will
be
shown
in
the
following
discussion
on
the
economic
impact
,
a
6month
month
delay
(
total
of
12
months
to
comply
)
in
the
application
of
section
403q
)
and
(
r2
)
to
dietary
supplements
would
result
in
over
40
percent
savings
of
compliance
cost
,
and
a
12month
month
delay
(
total
of
18
months
to
comply
)
would
result
in
over
50
percent
savings
.
given
the
large
disparity
in
costs
of
compliance
for
manufacturers
of
dietary
supplements
if
they
are
required
to
comply
in
6
months
,
as
compared
to
those
that
are
being
borne
by
manufacturers
of
food
in
conventional
form
,
fda
finds
that
it
should
tailor
the
delay
to
reduce
the
costs
for
dietary
supplement
manufacturers
and
thus
to
minimize
the
disparity
.
therefore
,
the
agency
concludes
that
it
is
appropriate
to
delay
the
application
date
for
dietary
supplements
for
12
months
,
as
it
did
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
thus
,
the
agency
intends
to
apply
section
403q
)
and
(
r2
)
to
foods
labeled
after
07/01/1995
.
the
agency
fully
expects
that
some
dietary
supplement
firms
will
be
able
to
comply
before
this
date
once
the
pressure
on
printing
labels
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
is
eased
after
05/08/1994
.
therefore
,
consumers
can
expect
to
begin
enjoying
the
health
benefits
of
the
label
changes
prior
to
07/01/1995
.
iii
.
economic
impact
some
comments
agreed
with
the
agencys
estimates
of
the
costs
of
relabeling
.
many
comments
were
directed
at
issues
covered
by
the
advance
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
(
anprm
,
which
addressed
the
safe
use
of
dietary
supplements
(
58
fr
33690
,
06/18/1993
.
several
comments
stated
that
the
three
proposals
that
the
agency
issued
(
there
was
a
proposed
rule
on
health
claims
(
58
fr
33700
in
addition
to
the
proposals
on
nutrition
labeling
and
nutrient
content
claims
)
and
the
anprm
should
be
considered
one
proposal
.
these
comments
stated
that
the
economic
impact
of
the
four
documents
would
exceed
$
100
million
and
would
be
considered
a
major
rule
under
executive
order
12291
.
the
agency
disagrees
.
executive
order
12291
did
not
apply
to
advance
notices
.
therefore
,
no
analysis
of
that
document
was
required
by
that
executive
order
.
(
fda
has
not
taken
any
action
with
respect
to
the
anprm
that
would
make
it
subject
to
executive
order
12866
.
the
three
proposals
are
concerned
with
the
labeling
of
dietary
supplements
,
while
the
anprm
is
concerned
with
other
issues
.
thus
,
the
costs
and
benefits
associated
with
regulatory
alternatives
described
in
the
anprm
can
be
separated
from
those
resulting
from
the
three
proposals
on
labeling
actions
.
the
agency
has
evaluated
the
labeling
actions
together
,
however
,
because
it
is
not
possible
to
separate
the
impacts
of
the
various
labeling
actions
.
finally
,
fda
is
taking
no
further
action
with
respect
to
the
anprm
at
this
time
.

several
comments
objected
to
the
agencys
estimate
of
the
number
of
products
that
will
be
affected
by
the
nutrition
labeling
and
nutrient
content
claims
rulemakings
.
two
comments
stated
that
there
are
25000
products
that
are
potentially
affected
by
the
rules
,
rather
than
the
agencys
estimate
of
5000
products
.
another
comment
stated
that
there
are
approximately
25000
herbal
products
alone
that
would
be
required
to
be
tested
and
relabeled
.
another
comment
objected
to
the
agencys
estimate
because
the
agency
failed
to
include
amino
acids
,
herbal
products
,
and
other
dietary
supplements
that
have
no
recognizable
food
function
.
in
its
analysis
of
the
proposals
,
fda
stated
that
there
could
be
as
many
as
25000
products
that
could
be
considered
to
be
dietary
supplements
.
the
agency
reduced
that
number
to
5000
,
an
estimate
of
the
number
of
vitamin
and
mineral
supplement
products
,
because
:
(
1
)
many
products
that
contain
herbs
or
other
similar
nutritional
substances
would
not
be
subject
to
the
nutrition
label
requirements
because
they
do
not
contain
the
nutrients
that
must
be
declared
,
and
(
2
)
some
products
marketed
as
dietary
supplements
would
be
unaffected
by
the
1990
amendments
because
they
bear
drug
claims
that
make
them
subject
to
the
drug
provisions
of
the
act
.
for
these
reasons
,
it
is
clear
that
not
all
25000
products
would
be
required
to
be
tested
or
relabeled
in
response
to
the
regulations
implementing
the
1990

however
,
fda
is
convinced
by
the
comments
that
some
herbal
products
and
other
dietary
supplements
might
need
to
be
tested
and
relabeled
as
a
result
of
these
regulations
.
fda
is
unable
to
determine
exactly
how
many
of
those
products
would
be
covered
by
the
food
provisions
of
the
act
rather
than
by
the
drug
provisions
.
therefore
,
the
agencys
final
analysis
of
the
rules
is
based
on
a
range
of
products
between
5000
and
25000
.

several
comments
objected
to
the
agencys
estimate
that
approximately
150
firms
will
be
affected
by
the
regulations
.
some
comments
stated
that
approximately
500
firms
would
be
affected
by
the
proposed
rules
if
made
final
.
another
comment
stated
that
250
herb
manufacturers
and
150
manufacturers
of
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
would
be
affected
.
another
comment
objected
to
the
agencys
source
for
the
number
of
firms
.
the
comment
explained
that
dunn
and
bradstreets
electronic
yellow
pages
is
primarily
a
listing
for
public
companies
,
and
the
majority
of
supplement
manufacturers
are
privatelyheld
privately
held
corporations
.
the
comment
suggested
that
conservative
estimates
suggest
that
there
are
a
minimum
of
150
herb
companies
alone
.
the
agency
has
confirmed
that
the
electronic
yellow
pages
covers
both
public
and
private
organizations
of
all
types
and
sizes
.
the
agency
admits
that
the
electronic
yellow
pages
is
not
a
perfect
source
for
the
number
of
firms
,
but
fda
believes
that
it
is
not
entirely
inadequate
.
the
major
difference
between
the
agencys
estimate
and
those
of
the
comments
is
the
inclusion
or
exclusion
of
manufacturers
herbal
products
and
products
containing
other
similar
nutritional
substances
.
as
stated
in
the
response
to
the
previous
comment
,
the
agency
has
determined
that
at
least
some
of
these
types
of
dietary
supplement
products
may
be
subject
to
the
nutrition
labeling
provisions
.
however
,
because
many
of
these
products
do
not
contain
significant
amounts
of
nutrients
,
many
manufacturers
will
not
be
faced
with
the
necessity
of
relabeling
their
products
.
for
these
reasons
,
the
agency
believes
that
its
estimate
of
the
number
of
firms
may
be
low
,
but
that
to
include
all
herbal
products
manufacturers
and
manufacturers
of
other
similar
nutritional
substances
would
inflate
the
estimate
.
however
,
the
agency
has
no
basis
on
which
to
arrive
at
the
actual
number
of
firms
.
therefore
,
in
its
final
analysis
,
the
agency
is
estimating
the
total
number
of
firms
affected
to
be
between
150
and
300

several
comments
disagreed
with
the
agencys
estimate
of
administrative
costs
.
the
comments
stated
that
actual
administrative
expenses
would
be
at
least
$
1000
per
label
.
administrative
expenses
,
according
to
the
comments
,
are
associated
with
the
creation
or
redesign
,
proofreading
,
legal
review
,
pricing
,
bid
review
,
and
retraining
of
customer
service
and
sales
staff
.
one
comment
estimates
that
administrative
costs
to
one
firm
would
be
80
to
120
hours
of
executive
time
,
or
approximately
$
2500
to
$
3750
.
fda
recognizes
that
the
factors
that
determine
administrative
costs
are
very
complicated
.
the
agencys
estimates
of
administrative
costs
are
based
on
a
compliance
cost
model
for
food
labeling
created
for
fda
by
research
triangle
institute
(
rti
)
(
ref
.
1
.
according
to
rti
,
many
firms
estimate
that
administrative
effort
would
be
twice
as
high
for
a
6month
month
compliance
period
as
for
a
12month
month
compliance
period
.
in
the
dietary
supplement
proposals
,
fda
estimated
that
for
a
6month
month
compliance
period
,
manufacturers
of
dietary
supplements
will
incur
administrative
costs
of
$
850
per
firm
.
the
range
of
administrative
cost
estimates
submitted
in
the
comments
was
broad
and
there
were
no
identifiable
patterns
to
the
estimates
given
.
although
fda
acknowledges
that
its
assumptions
may
have
resulted
in
underestimates
,
the
comments
did
not
provide
enough
detailed
information
to
permit
fda
to
evaluate
the
administrative
cost
estimates
that
they
submitted
.
therefore
,
the
agency
is
not
altering
its
original
estimates
based
on
these
comments
.
the
agency
has
determined
that
total
administrative
costs
for
a
6month
month
compliance
period
are
between
$
130000
and
$
250000
,
depending
on
the
exact
number
of
firms
affected
by
the
regulations
.
as
determined
by
the
contractors
study
(
ref
.
1
,
administrative
costs
are
lower
with
longer
compliance
periods
.
a
1year

period
results
in
administrative
costs
of
between
$
65000
and
$
125000
.
an

results
in
administrative

of
between

.
one
comment
stated
that
the
requirement
that
herbal
dietary
supplements
be
required
to
bear
nutrition
labeling
would
mandate
that
all
herbal
products
be
assayed
for
their
nutrient
content
.
the
comment
further
explained
that
testing
for
12
nutrients
would
cost
$
588
per
product
for
a
total
of
$
15
million
for
25000
products
.
the
agency
agrees
that
to
the
extent
that
herbal
product
manufacturers
will
provide
nutrition
labeling
,
herbal
products
will
need
to
be
assayed
for
their
nutrient
content
.
the
agency
notes
,
however
,
that
many
herbs
do
not
contain
significant
amounts
of
the
nutrients
that
must
be
listed
in
the
nutrition
label
,
and
that
this
fact
is
determinable
from
reference
works
without
testing
.
thus
,
these
herbs
will
not
need
to
be
tested
.
many
comments
admitted
that
,
in
general
,
herbal
products
do
not
contain
significant
amounts
of
nutrients
and
are
not
consumed
for
their
nutrient
content
.
however
,
some
herbal
products
and
combination
products
will
require
nutrient
testing
.
in
the
proposals
,
the
agency
assumed
that
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
will
not
undergo
any
additional
testing
as
a
result
of
the
nutrition
labeling
requirements
.
comments
did
not
object
to
this
assumption
.
therefore
,
in
its
final
analysis
,
the
agency
is
estimating
that
as
many
as
20000
products
may
undergo
testing
once
every
5
years
for
a
total
discounted
analytical
cost
over
the
next
20
years
of
$
33

and
several
comments
disagreed
,
with
the
agencys
estimate
of
label
printing
and
redesign
costs
.
the
comments
that
disagreed
stated
that
printing
and
redesign
costs
would
be
at
least
$
800
to
$
1200
per
label
.
one
comment
stated
that
the
cost
of
redesigning
and
printing
each
label
would
be
2
hours
of
desktop
redesign
,
$
20
for
linotronic
service
,
and
$
600
for
new
plates
,
for
a
total
of
$
750
per
label
.
one
comment
objected
to
fdas
assumption
that
label
revisions
for
supplements
are
less
comprehensive
than
revisions
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
the
comment
states
that
incorporating
the
`
nutrition
facts
'
section
plus
the
ingredient
list
will
necessitate
complete
redistribution
of
information
on
many
labels
.
in
the
analysis
of
the
proposed
rules
,
the
agency
estimated
that
,
for
a
6month
month
compliance
period
,
printing
and
redesign
costs
would
be
approximately
$
1000
per
label
.
the
comments
do
not
suggest
that
the
agencys
estimate
is
incorrect
.
therefore
,
the
agencys
final
analysis
of
printing
costs
is
based
on
a
per
label
cost
of
$
1000
for
each
of
between
15000
and
75000
labels
,
or
between
$
15
million
and
$
75
million
.
according
to
the
rti
study
,
the
length
of
the
compliance
period
determines
a
firms
ability
to
combine
planned
label
changes
with
mandated
changes
.
therefore
,
incremental
labeling
and
redesign
activities
are
less
costly
with
lengthier
compliance
periods
.
if
the
agency
extended
the
compliance
period
by
only
6
months
,
printing
and
redesign
costs
would
be
between
$
75
million
and
$
375
million
.
the
1year
year
extension
that
the
agency
is
providing
will
reduce
printing
and
redesign
costs
to
between
$
6
million
and
$
28
million
.

several
comments
provided
data
on
label
inventories
that
would
be
subject
to
disposal
.
these
comments
stated
that
a
4

to
6month
month
supply
of
product
labels
is
common
,
resulting
in
$
34
million
to
$
51
million
of
label
inventory
that
will
be
discarded
.
another
comment
suggested
that
its
dietary
supplement
label
and
box
inventory
disposal
costs
would
be
$
325000
with
a
6month
month
compliance
period
,
$
200000
with
a
1year
year
compliance
period
,
and
$
50000
with
an
18month

compliance
period
.
one
comment
estimated
the
cost
of
discarding
noncompliant
labels
would
be
approximately
$
30000
for
one
firm
.
the
estimates
provided
by
the
comments
are
in
line
with
the
agencys
preliminary
estimate
of
label
inventory
disposal
costs
.
therefore
,
the
agency
is
not
changing
its
estimate
based
on
the
comments
.
the
cost
of
label
inventory
disposal
for
a
6month
month
compliance
period
is
between
$
5
million
and
$
25
million
,
depending
on
the
number
of
products
affected
.
according
to
the
rti
study
and
comments
,
lengthier
compliance
periods
allow
firms
to
use
up
more
existing
label
supplies
,
thus
reducing
inventory
disposal
costs
.
according
to
data
submitted

adjusted
to
reflect
the

,
if
the
agency

extended
the
compliance
period
for
an
additional

months
,
inventory
disposal
costs
would
be
between
$

$

the
18month

the
cost
of
inventory
disposal
.
the
comments
argued
that
firms
would
dispose
of
finished
product
in
addition
to
labels
.
the
comments
stated
that
typical
product
costs
for
dietary
supplements
would
result
in
an
inventory
value
for
the
disposal
of
5000
products
of
between
$
48
million
and
$
73
million
.
one
firm
estimated
its
own
cost
of
discarding
noncompliant
inventory
would
be
approximately
30
percent
of
finished
goods
inventory
,
or
about
$
45000
.
because
these
proposals
cover
only
the
labeling
of

,
the
agency
does
not
agree
that
there
would
be
any
reason
for

to
dispose

nor

the

,
they
must
comply
with
the

that

common
practice
in
the

industry
to
accept

in
the

industry

would
be
faced
with
a
number
of
products
returned
from

unwilling
to
carry
products
with
older

the
comments
estimated
the
cost
of

,
and
applying
for

credit
at

labeled

extent
that

is
returned
,
the
cost
of
disposing
of

returned
from

should
be
considered
a
cost
of
these

is
unsure

several
comments
expressed
concern
that
the
rules
may
cause
the
loss
of
many
thousands
of
jobs
,
the
closing
of
many
firms
,
and
the
loss
of
products
from
the
marketplace

according
to
one
comment
,
the
proposed
rules
would
cause
the
loss
of
more
than
$
10
million
in
sales
and
as
many
as
100
jobs
in

another
comment

a
belief
that

million
americans
will
lose
their
jobs
as

the
regulations

the
comments
did
not
provide
any
specific
information
as
to
how
the
regulations
would
cause
the
loss
of
jobs
and
products
.
the
agency
agrees
that
the
inability
to
make
certain
nutrient
content
or
health
claims
may
reduce
the
marketability
of
certain
products
and
perhaps
lead
to
a
companys
decision
to
remove
a
product
from
the
marketplace
.
however
,
these
rules
affect
only
labeling
;
they
do
not
require
any
supplement
to
be
removed
from
the
market
.
moreover
,
the
agency
does
not
believe
that
many
products
are
currently
making
health
claims
,
as
distinguished
from
drug
claims
or
structurefunction
structure
function
claims
.
therefore
,
the
agency
has
no
basis
to
find
that
these
regulations
will
cause
the
problems
described
in
these
comments
.
the
agency
believes
that
there
is
every
reason
to
expect
that
the
continued
marketing
of
the
vast
majority
of
dietary
supplement
products
will
be
unaffected
by
these
regulations
.

.
in
the
analysis
of
the
proposed
rules
,
the
agency
recognized
that
the
rules
could
have
an
adverse
impact
on
small
businesses
.
most
of
the
costs
associated
with
labeling
regulations
are
fixed
costs
,
which
are
typically
more
burdensome
for
small
firms
than
for
large
firms
because
of
the
smaller
sales
base
on
which
to
spread
costs
.
one
comment
stated
that
the
small
business
exemption
was
inadequate
because
small
firms
would
not
be
able
to
avoid
complying
with
the
regulations
because
of
competitive
pressure
.
another
comment
stated
that
the
proposals
would
be
catastrophic
to
small
business
owners
and
workers
.
fda

of

significantly
mitigate
any

that
the
proposed
rule
regarding
health
claims
will
cause
pain
,
suffering
,
and
death
that
would
not
occur
were
labeling
and
advertising
allowed
to
include

.
the
comment
was
unspecific
as
to
why
these
results
would
occur
.
if
the
absence
of
health
claims
causes
pain
,
suffering
,
or
death
,
these
regulations
provide
any
party
with
a
vehicle
for
submitting
data
to
support
a
particular
health
claim
for
agency
review
.
therefore
,
the

does
not
agree

one
comment
stated
that
the
regulations
will
provide
benefits
by
preventing
consumers
from
wasting
money
on
unnecessary
and
ineffective
dietary
supplements
.
another
comment
stated
that
if
someone
wanted
to
waste
a
little
money
taking
too
many
vitamins
or
supplements
in
the
hope
of
avoiding
serious
illness
and
the
need
for
harsh
drugs
,
they
should
be
allowed
to
do
so
.
because
there
are
sources
other
than
labeling
that
provide
information
about
the
potential
uses
of
dietary
supplements
,
the
agency
believes
that
limiting
the
use
of
claims
on
labels
or
labeling
will
be
of
limited
effect
in
preventing
consumers
from
purchasing
supplements
that
they
erroneously
believe
will
prevent
serious
illness
.
however
,
these
regulations
will
ensure
that
the
labels
of
dietary
supplements
will
provide
full
nutrition
labeling
to
help
consumers
to
maintain
healthy
dietary
practices
,
and
they
will
help
to
ensure
that
any
nutrient
content
or
health
claims
made
in
the
labeling
of
these
products
are
scientifically
valid
,
truthful
,
and
not
misleading
.
for
these
reasons
,
these
regulations
will
provide
a
significant
benefit
.

some
comments
stated
that
the
cost
of
providing
nutrition
information
on
the
labels
of
dietary
supplements
of
herbs
would
greatly
outweigh
any
clear
public
benefit
.
the
comments
explained
that
herbs
do
not
contain
significant
amounts
of
the
core
nutrients
and
are
not
normally
consumed
for
their
nutritional
value
.
therefore
,
the
value
to
consumers
of
including
nutrition
labeling
on
herb
products
is
insignificant
.
the
agency
agrees
with
this
comment
.
however
,
the
agency
notes
that
those
products
that
do
not
contain
significant
amounts
of
the
14
mandatory
nutrients
will
generally
not
be
required
to
bear
nutrition
labeling
.
therefore
,
although
there
will
be
no
clear
public
benefit
,
there
will
also
be
no
cost
.

summary
of
the

fda
has
examined
the
economic
implications
of
the
final
rules
amending
on
nutrition
labeling
,
nutrient
content
claims
,
and
health
claims
for
dietary

required

executive
order
12866
directs
agencies
to
assess
all
costs
and
benefits
of
available
regulatory
alternatives
and
,
when
regulation
is
necessary
,
to
select
regulatory
approaches
that
maximize
net
benefits
(
including
potential
economic
,
environmental
,
public
health
and
safety
effects
;
distributive
impacts
;
and
equity
.
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
requires
analyzing
options
for
regulatory
relief
for
small
businesses
.
fda
finds
that
these
final
rules
on
dietary
supplements
,
taken
together
,
are
not
significant
as
defined
by
executive
order
12866
.
in
accordance
with
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
,
the
agency
certifies
that
the
final
rules
will
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
businesses
.
the
agency
has
reviewed
the
comments
and
has
determined
that
the
costs
of
compliance
associated
with
the
18month
month
compliance
period
provided
by
the
agency
include
administrative
costs
of
between
$
50000
and
$
100000
,
analytical
costs
of
between
$
0
and
$
33
million
,
printing
and
redesign
costs
of
between
$
6
and
$
28
million
,
and
label
inventory
disposal
costs
of
between
$
2
and
$
9
million
.
total
discounted
costs
of
the
final
regulations
,
taken
together
are
between
$
8
and
$
60
million
(
7
percent
discount
rate
.
if
the
agency
did
not
extend
the
application
of
the
rules
,
total
discounted
costs
would
be
between
$
20
and
$
133
million
for
a
6month
month
compliance
period
,
or
between
$
11
