in
the
hdw
eis
rod
,
doe
deferred
final
disposal
decisions
for
the
tank
wastes
contained
in
singleshell
single
shell
tanks
(
ssts
,
pending
further
evaluations
in
a
supplemental
eis
.
however
,
to
meet
regulatory
requirements
,
does
current
planning
basis
is
to
retrieve
sst
waste
,
and
to
integrate
doubleshell
double
shell
tank
(
dst
)
and
sst
waste
management
activities
leading
to
final
disposal
.
because
doe
now
proposes
to
integrate
sst
and
dst
waste
management
programs
,
the
twrs
eis
described
in
this
noi
will
replace
the
previously
planned
supplement
to
the
hdw
eis
.
the
twrs
eis
will
address
the
does
proposal
for
the
management
,
treatment
,
storage
,
and
disposal
of
the
waste
currently
stored
in
the
existing
149
ssts
and
28
dsts
and
other
wastes
to
be
generated
during
future
decontamination
and
decommissioning
activities
at
hanford
.
doe
recognizes
that
removal
of
waste
from
the
tanks
may
trigger
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
(
rcra
)
treatment
and
disposal
requirements
to
complete
closure
of
the
tanks
.
however
,
the
impacts
of
tank
closure
cannot
be
meaningfully
evaluated
at
this
time
.
doe
will
conduct
an
appropriate
nepa
review
,
such
as
an
eis
to
support
tank
closure
,
in
the
future
.
the
planned
interim
action
eis
will
address
the
construction
of
six
new
tanks
and
associated
new
transfer
lines
,
and
the
tank
operations
.
for
the
purposes
of
this
interim
action
eis
,
operations
considered
would
be
limited
to
the
retrieval
,
ph
adjustment
or
alkalinity
control
,
and
storage
of
wastes
from
the
watchlist
safety
tanks
.
the
primary
focus
of
the
eis
would
be
the
resolution
of
safety
issues
related
to
the
three
tanks
that
are
on
the
watchlist
because
of
hydrogen
generation
(
241sy101
,
241sy103
and
241an104
,
but
the
tanks
may
also
be
used
to
alleviate
safety
concerns
in
other
watchlist
tanks
(
50
tanks
are
currently
on
the
watchlist
.
further
decisions
regarding
the
retrieval
,
treatment
and
disposal
of
wastes
from
the
watchlist
tanks
will
be
the
subject
of
the
twrs
