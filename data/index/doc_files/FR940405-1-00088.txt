natural
ventilation
occurs
when
desired
air
flows
occur
through
windows

doors

chimneys
and
other
building
openings
.
mechanical
ventilation
is
the
mechanically
induced
movement
of
air
through
the
building
.
mechanical
systems
usually
condition
and
filter
the
air
and
allow
for
the
entry
of
outdoor
air
through
outdoor
dampers

infiltration
is
the
unwanted
movement
of

through

and
openings
into
the

shell
.
the
outside
air
ventilation
rate
of
a
building
affects
indoor
air
quality
.
it
determines
the
extent
to
which

are
diluted

removed
from
the
indoor
environment
.
the
extent
to
which
outside
air
ventilation
is
effective
in
diluting
indoor
contaminants
depends
on
how
well
outside
air
is
mixed
with
indoor
air
and
is
reflected
by
ventilation
efficiency
.

the
rate
at
which
outside
air
is
supplied
to
a
building
is
specified
by
the

carbon

the

believes
that
it
is
necessary
to
require

the
hvac

it
is

customary
for

the
oil
embargo
of
1973
brought
about
the
realization
that
considerable
savings
could
be
made
in
reducing
the
consumption
of
energy
used
to
heat
and
cool
buildings
.
prior
to
1973
,
the
energy
to
heat
and
cool
buildings
was
much
cheaper
and
the
buildings
reflected
that
reality
.
building
enclosures
had
lower
insulating
values
and
allowed
more
infiltration
.
more
air
was
circulated
to
the
occupied
spaces
and
more
outdoor
air
was
provided
for
ventilation
.
this
resulted
in
a
lower
concentration
of
pollutants
and
higher
velocities
of
air
motion
in
indoor
air
.
office
buildings
were
divided
into
individual
rooms
with
their
own
walls
as
opposed
to
the
current
practice
of
open
spaces
with
movable
screens
[

the
centralization
of
services
and
the
expanding
economy
have
led
to
concentration
of
office
space
in
the
cities
.
the
cost
of
land
has
shaped
buildings
into
highrise
high
rise
structures
.
the
cost
of
materials
and
popularity
of
mirror
glass
has
led
to
the
sprouting
of
hundreds
of
what
may
be
termed
`
glass
boxes
.
these
boxes
are
sealed
to
keep
out
noise
and
pollutionmainly
from
traffic
.
buildings
designed
after
1973
have
incorporated
many
energy
conservation
measures
that
range
from
adjusting
thermal
comfort
zones
to
increased
awareness
of
lighting
efficiency

to
designing
new
operating

in
large
buildings
,
outside
air
ventilation
rates
were
also
reduced
by
closing
outside
air
dampers
in
mechanical
ventilation
systems
at
nights
,
on
weekends
and
sometimes
even
during
occupancy
.
as
a
result
of
these
measures
,
which
primarily
reduced
costs
for
conditioning
outdoor
air
as
opposed
to
increasing
energy
efficiency
,
considerable
energy
savings
have
been
achieved
in
buildings
.
in
addition
,
during
the
1970s
variable
air
volume
(
vav
)
hvac
systems
became
widely
accepted
.
vav
systems
condition
supply
air
to
a
constant
temperature
and
insure
thermal
comfort
by
varying
the
airflow
.
early
vav
systems
did
not
allow
control
of
the
outside
air
quantity
,
so
that
a
decreasing
amount
of
outside
air
was
provided
as
the
flow
of
supply
air
was
reduced
.
in
some
cases
,
building
design
flaws
contribute
to
the
poor
quality
of
indoor
air
,
such
as
locating
air
intake
vents
near
to
a
loading
dock
or
parking
garage
.
design
flaws
of
interior
space
also
contribute
to
indoor
air
problems
.
most
building
cooling
systems
are
designed
to
remove
the
heat
generated
by
office
machines
,
employees
and
light
.
the
heat
generated
by
these
sources
often
exceeds
the
capacity
of
the
hvac
system
to
remove
it
[

ideally
with
effective
filtration
and
management
systems
,
the
air
indoors
should
be
cleaner
than
the
air
outdoors
