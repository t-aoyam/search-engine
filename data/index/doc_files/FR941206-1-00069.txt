in
an
effort
to
develop
standards
that
did
not
require
measuring
the
volume
of
solids
,
the
measurement
work
group
decided
to
explore
a
format
based
on
the
weight
of
solids
used
,
rather
than
the
volume
of
finishing
material
or
volume
of
solids
.
in
evaluating
a
format
of
lb
hap
emitted
per
lb
solids
used
,
the
measurement
work
group
first
concluded
that
this
format
predicted
actual
emission
reductions
better
than
any
other
format
when
extremes
in
finishing
materials
were
tested
.
for
example
,
if
a
source
were
to
increase
the
solids
content
of
its
finishing
material
and
decrease
its
usage
of
finishing
materials
,
the
format
of
lb
hap
lb
solids
properly
credited
the
sources
emission
reduction
.
three
potential
drawbacks
to
the
format
of
lb
hap
lb
solids
were
identified
by
the
measurement
work
group
.
the
first
drawback
concerned
higher
solids
stains
.
unlike
the
film
building
finishing
materials
,
stain
usage
is
not
directly
related
to
the
solids
content
.
a
source
could
use
a
higher
solids
stain
to
reduce
its
lb
hap
lb
solids
level
without
decreasing
stain
usage
or
hap
emissions
.
the
second
drawback
was
that
a
source
could
double
its
film
thickness
to
reduce
the
lb
hap
lb
solids
value
while
increasing
emissions
.
the
third
drawback
with
using
a
lb
hap
lb
solids
format
is
related
to
pigmented
finishing
materials
such
as
basecoats
and
enamels
.
some
of
the
pigments
used
in
these
finishing
materials
have
a
higher
density
than
the
solids
used
in
conventional
finishing
materials
.
while
these
finishing
materials
typically
have
a
lower
hap
content
than
the
conventional
finishing
materials
used
by
the
industry
,
the
lb
hap
lb
solids
format
for
these
finishing
materials
will
overestimate
the
actual
decrease
in
emissions
because
of
the
higher
density
of
the
solids
.
the
work
group
presented
its
findings
to
the
committee
along
with
a
recommendation
that
,
despite
the
drawbacks
,
the
lb
hap
lb
solids
format
was
the
most
reasonable
.
regarding
the
first
drawback
(
the
problem
with
higher
solids
stains
,
the
work
group
agreed
that
this
issue
did
not
pose
a
significant
problem
with
the
lb
hap
lb
solids
format
.
an
analysis
of
an
extreme
case
,
that
is
,
a
stain
with
a
solids
content
at
the
upper
end
of
the
normal
range
,
indicated
that
the
error
would
be
less
than
5
percent
,
which
the
committee
agreed
was
an
acceptable
margin
of
error
.
however
,
another
issue
associated
with
the
relationship
between
a
lb
hap
lb
solids
format
and
stains
was
raised
by
industry
when
the
committee
was
developing
the
compliant
coatings
approach
for
meeting
the
emission
limitation
.
as
discussed
,
stains
are
lowsolids
low
solids
finishing
materials
so
formulating
a
stain
to
meet
a
limitation
based
on
solids
is
difficult
.
the
industry
indicated
that
a
compliant
stain
could
be
formulated
,
but
only
if
the
emission
limitation
applied
only
to
the
volatile
hap
in
the
coating
.
stains
may
contain
small
amounts
of
nonvolatile
hap
such
as
chromium
and
manganese
compounds
for
which
there
are
no
readily
acceptable
nonhap
hap
substitutions
.
the
industry
pointed
out
that
a
significant
percentage
of
these
nonvolatile
hap
are
captured
and
controlled
by
filters
in
the
spray
booths
.
a
small
percentage
may
be
emitted
from
overspray
that
is
not
captured
by
the
filters
,
but
industry
indicated
that
these
emissions
will
be
reduced
by
the
equipment
requirements
of
the
proposed
standards
,
which
will
reduce
finishing
material
usage
and
overspray
(
see
discussion
of
work
practices
in
section
vie
.
the
committee
agreed
that
these
nonvolatile
hap
will
be
reduced
both
by
filters
and
by
the
application
equipment
requirements
so
that
the
emission
limitation
for
the
finishing
materials
would
apply
only
to
the
volatile
hap
.
regarding
the
second
drawback
(
the
coating
thickness
issue
,
industry
pointed
out
that
economics
would
preclude
a
source
from
meeting
standards
expressed
as
a
lb
hap
lb
solids
by
doubling
the
coating
thickness
.
according
to
industry
representatives
,
finishing
lines
are
designed
to
run
at
a
certain
speed
.
to
increase
coating
thickness
,
the
line
would
have
to
be
slowed
down
to
apply
more
finishing
material
.
this
practice
would
lower
the
overall
production
rate
.
the
cost
of
the
additional
finishing
material
and
the
lost
production
would
deter
a
source
from
this
approach
.
industry
representatives
also
pointed
out
that
,
in
most
situations
,
the
product
quality
would
suffer
if
the
coating
thickness
were
doubled
.
given
the
unlikely
situation
of
a
source
doubling
its
coating
thickness
,
the
committee
agreed
that
this
was
not
a
significant
drawback
to
the
lb
hap
lb
solids
format
.
