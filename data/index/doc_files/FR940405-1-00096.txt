applying

introduction
the
declared
purpose
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
(
osh
)
act
of
1970
is
`
*
*
*
*
*
to
assure
so
far
as
possible
every
working
man
and
woman
in
the
nation
safe
and
healthful
working
conditions
and
to
preserve
our
human
resources
.
*
*
*
*
*
'
thus
,
the
act
requires
the
secretary
of
labor
,
when
promulgating
occupational
safety
and
health
standards
for
toxic
materials
or
harmful
physical
agents
,
to
set
the
standard
`
*
*
*
*
*
that
most
adequately
assures
,
to
the
extent
feasible
,
on
the
basis
of
the
best
available
evidence
,
that
no
employee
will
suffer
material
impairment
of
health
or
functional
capacity
.
*
*
*
*
*
'
it
is
on
the
basis
of
this
congressional
directive
that
osha
has
initiated
regulatory
actions
to
reduce
the
adverse
health
effects
associated
with
occupational
exposure
to
indoor
air
pollutants
.
the
discussion
below
assesses
the
requisite
preconditions
for
optimal
safety
in
the
context
of
a
free
market
economy
,
and
real
world
economic
factors
are
compared
with
the
free
market
paradigm
to
illustrate
the
shortcoming
of
the
nonregulatory
environment
.
(

)
market
imperfections
economic
theory
suggests
that
the
need
for
government
regulation
is
greatly
reduced
where
private
markets
work
efficiently
and
effectively
to
allocate
health
and
safety
resources
.
the
theory
typically
assumes
perfectly
competitive
labor
markets
where
employees
,
having
perfect
knowledge
of
job
risks
and
being
perfectly
mobile
among
jobs
,
command
wage
premiums
that
fully
compensate
for
any
risk
of
future
harm
.
thus
,
theoretically
,
the
costs
of
occupational
injury
and
illness
are
borne
initially
by
the
firms
responsible
for
the
hazardous
workplace
conditions
and
ultimately
by
the
consumers
who
pay
for
the
final
goods
and
services
produced
by
these
firms
.
with
all
costs
internalized
,
private
employers
have
an
incentive
to
reduce
hazards
wherever
the
cost
of
hazard
abatement
is
less
than
the
total
cost
to
the
firm
,
the
work
force
,
and
society
of
the
expected
injury
or
illness
.
the
conditions
of
perfect
competition
do
not
need
to
be
completely
satisfied
in
order
for
the
forces
of
the
market
to
approximate
an
efficient
outcome
.
however
,
some
market
imperfections
can
produce
suboptimal
sub
optimal
results
that
can
be
improved
upon
with
regulatory
action
.
in
the
case
of
this
rulemaking
,
employees
face
a
significant
health
risk
which
is
not
adequately
addressed
by
current
nonregulatory
alternatives
.
osha
,
therefore
,
believes
that
it
must
take
appropriate
actions
to
provide
greater
health
protection
for
workers
exposed
to
toxic
substances
.
although
osha
believes
that
adequate
job
safety
and
health
could
exist
in
the
private
market
under
perfect
conditions
,
the
private
market
often
fails
to
provide
acceptable
levels
of
safety
and
health
in
instances
where
these
conditions
are
not
met
.
it
appears
that
at
least
two
of
several
conditions
traditionally
considered
essential
components
of
perfect
markets
are
absent
from
the
environment
in
which
employees
are
exposed
to
hazards
associated
with
exposure
to
indoor
pollutants
:
(

)
perfect
employee
knowledge
of
risks
and
(
2
)
perfect
employee
mobility
between
jobs
.
first
,
evidence
on
occupational
health
hazards
in
general
suggests
that
in
the
absence
of
immediate
or
clearcut
clear
cut
danger
,
employees
and
employers
have
little
incentive
to
seek
or
provide
information
on
the
potential
longterm
long
term
effects
of
exposure
.
employers
faced
with
potentially
high
compensatory
payments
may
,
in
fact
,
have
a
disincentive
to
provide
information
to
employees
.
when
relevant
information
is
provided
,
however
,
employers
and
employees
might
still
find
informed
decisionmaking
a
difficult
task
,
especially
where
long
latency
periods
precede
the
development
of
chronic
disabling
disease
.
moreover
,
if
signs
and
symptoms
are
nonspecificthat
is
,
if
an
illness
could
be
jobrelated
job
related
or
could
have
other
causesemployees
and
employers
may
not
link
disease
with
such
occupational
exposure
.
second
,
even
if
workers
were
fully
informed
of
the
health
risks
associated
with
exposure
to
hazardous
substances
,
many
face
limited
employment
options
.
nontransferability
of
occupational
skills
and
high
national
unemployment
rates
sharply
reduce
a
workers
expectation
of
obtaining
alternative
employment
quickly
or
easily
.
in
many
regions
of
the
country
,
the
practical
choice
for
workers
is
not
between
a
safe
job
and
a
better
paying
but
more
hazardous
position
,
but
simply
between
employment
and
unemployment
at
the
prevailing
rates
of
pay
and
risk
.
in
addition
to
the
fear
of
substantial
income
loss
from
prolonged
periods
of
unemployment
,
the
high
costs
of
relocation
,
the
reluctance
to
break
family
and
community
ties
,
and
the
growth
of
institutional
factors
such
as
pension
plans
and
seniority
rights
serve
to
elevate
the
cost
of
job
transfer
.
thus
,
especially
where
wages
are
more
responsive
to
the
demands
of
more
mobile
workers
who
tend
to
be
younger
and
perhaps
less
aware
of
job
risks
,
hazard
premiums
for
the
average
worker
will
not
be
fully
compensated
.
where
this
is
the
case
,
labor
market
negotiations
are
unlikely
to
reflect
accurately
the
value
that
workers
place
on
health
.
in
addition
to
these
market
imperfections
,
externalities
occur
if
employers
and
employees
settle
for
an
inefficiently
low
level
of
protection
from
hazardous
substances
.
for
the
competitive
market
to
function
efficiently
,
only
workers
and
their
employers
should
be
affected
by
the
level
of
safety
and
health
provided
in
market
transactions
.
in
the
case
of
occupational
safety
and
health
,
however
,
society
shares
part
of
the
financial
burden
of
occupationally
induced
diseases
,
including
the
costs
of
premature
death
,
chronic
illness
,
and
disability
.
those
individuals
who
suffer
from
occupationally
related
illnesses
are
cared
for
and
compensated
by
society
through
taxpayer
support
of
social
programs
,
including
welfare
,
social
security
,
and
medicare
.
if
private
employers
do
not
have
to
pay
the
full
cost
of
production
,
they
have
no
economic
incentive
to
reduce
hazards
whenever
the
cost
of
hazard
abatement
is
greater
than
the
cost
of
the
expected
illness
.
in
this
way
,
the
private
market
fails
to
produce
optimal
levels
of
safety
.
