.
federal
funds

support
the
project
must
not
exceed
75
%
of
the
total
cost

the
project
.
the
25
%
match
may
be
provided
by
the
applicant

any
other
organization
or
institution
,
except
that
no
portion
of
the
25
%
match
can
include
federal
funds

a
percentage
of

entire
cost
of
the
project
.
for
example
,
if
the
75
%
federal
portion
is
$
5000

then
the
entire
project

,
at
a
minimum

have
a
budget
of
$
6667

with
the
recipient
providing
a
