a
wide
spectrum
of
health

have

these

include
mucous

adverse

on

pharmacokinetics
whether
a
chemical
elicits
toxicity
or
not
depends
not
only
on
its
inherent
potency
and
site
specificity
but
also
on
how
the
human
system
can
metabolize
and
excrete
that
particular
chemical
.
to
produce
health
effects
,
the
constituents
of
ets
must
be
absorbed
and
must
be
present
in
appropriate
concentration
at
the
sites
of
action
.
after
absorption
,
some
of
these
contaminants
are
metabolized
to
less
toxic
metabolites
while
some
carcinogens
are
activated
by
metabolism
in
the
body
.
available
biomarkers
of
ets
,
such
as
nicotine
,
clearly
show
that
nonsmoker
exposure
is
of
sufficient
magnitude
to
be
absorbed
and
to
result
in
measurable
levels
of
these
biomarkers
.
there
is
sufficient
evidence
in
the
literature
to
indicate
that
several
components
of
sidestream
smoke
are
rapidly
absorbed
and
widely
distributed
within
the
body
.
however
,
the
extent
of
absorption
,
distribution
,
retention
and
metabolism
of
these
contaminants
in
the
body
depends
upon
various
physiological
and
pharmacokinetic
parameters
that
are
influenced
by
gender
,
race
,
age
and
smoking
habits
of
the
exposed
individuals
.
these
parameters
and
others
may
result
in
differences
in
susceptibility
among
exposed
subpopulations
.
nicotine
is
one
of
the
most
widely
studied
constituents
of
tobacco
smoke
.
there
have
been
numerous
studies
on
the
pharmacokinetics
of
nicotine
in
both

and

absorption
and
distribution
.
absorption
and
distribution
of
tobacco
smoke
constituents
are
usually
measured
by
using
surrogate
markers
.
a
correlation
between
nicotine
absorption
and
exposure
to
tobacco
smoke
has
between
demonstrated
,
thus
making
nicotine
an
appropriate
marker
for
tobacco
smoke
in
pharmacokinetic
studies
.
the
steady
state
volume
of
distribution
for
nicotine
is
large
indicating
that
it
is
widely
distributed
within
the
body
[

.
nicotine
has
been
shown
to
bind
with
plasma
proteins
which
may
interfere
with
elimination
and
thereby
prolong
retention
in
the
body
.
the
studies
in
the
docket
clearly
indicate
that
nicotine
and
other
constituents
of
tobacco
smoke
are
readily
absorbed
and
distributed
throughout
the
body
thereby
increasing
the
potential
of
producing
adverse
effects
at
more
then
one
target
site

metabolism
.
nicotine
is
rapidly
eliminated
,
primarily
via
metabolism
and
urinary
excretion
.
the
investigation
of
metabolism
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
,
,
has
resulted
in
the
identification
of
more
than
20
metabolic
products
in
the
plasma
and
urine
of
humans
and
animals
.
the
principle
metabolic
pathways
of
nicotine
appear
to
involve
oxidation
of
the
pyrrolidine
ring
to
yield

nicotine

and
cotinine
,
the
latter
being
the
major
metabolite
and
the

of
many
of
the
metabolic
products
of
nicotine

some
of
the

clearance
was
faster

more
rapid
elimination
of
nicotine

cotinine
has
been
attributed
to
the
inductive
effects
of
chronic
cigarette
smoking
on
the
hepatic
metabolism
of
many

agents

however

benowitz

[

were
unable
to
confirm
published
research
suggesting
that
smokers
metabolize
nicotine
and
cotinine
more
rapidly
than
nonsmokers
.
variations
in
nicotine
metabolism
occur
among
individuals

variations
also
occur
due
to
differences
in
gender
and
race
[

it
has
also
been
suggested
that
the
metabolism
of
nicotine
between
smokers
and
nonsmokers
may
differ
.
male
smokers
have
been
shown
to
metabolize
nicotine
faster
than
do
female
smokers
after
intravenous
infusion
of
nicotine
and
active
smoking
.
however
,
this
difference
was
not
observed
by
benowitz
and
jacob
[
ex
.
423
]
during
a
study
of
daily
intake
of
nicotine
in
smokers
versus
nonsmokers
.
the
metabolism
of
nicotine
has
also
been
studied
in
animals
.
male
rats
(

strains
)
were
shown
to
metabolize
nicotine
faster
than
did

in
summary
,
the
potential
effect
of
nicotine
,
and
other
ets
constituents
in
the
body
,
is
governed
by
interactions
between
several
physiological
and
pharmacokinetics
parameters
.
these
interactions
may
lead
to
longer
retention
of
toxic
constituents
,
thus
prolonging
the
effects
on
the
target
organs
resulting
in
tissue
injury
.

irritation
exposure
to
ets
is
capable
of
inducing
eye
and
upper
respiratory
tract
irritation
.
common
chemical
sense
or
irritation
perception
is
mediated
through
receptors
in
the
fifth
,
ninth
,
and
tenth
cranial
nerves
.
these
receptors
are
found
throughout
the
nasal
,
pharyngeal
,
and
laryngeal
areas
of
the
respiratory
system
and
also
on
the
surface
of
the
eyes
[
ex
.
4239
.
it
is
partially
through
the
stimulation
of
these
receptors
that
exposed
persons
perceive
irritation
.
