in
short
,
the
procedures
used
by
a
school
that
uses
alternative
origination
differ
in
two
ways
from
the
procedures
of
originating
schools
.
the
first
is
that
a
school
under
alternative
origination
may
choose
to
designate
the
alternative
originator
as
the
manager
of
promissory
note
disclosure
statements
.
the
second
is
that
a
school
under
alternative
origination
does
not
manage
the
funds
draw
down
process
;
instead
,
the
school
receives
funds
drawn
down
by
the
alternative
originator
only
for
those
completed
promissory
notes
in
the
possession
of
the
alternative
originator
.
the
secretary
anticipates
that
issues
related
to
participation
of
alternative
originators
in
future
years
will
be
subject
to
the
negotiated
rulemaking
process
.
c
.
federal
direct
plus
loans
federal
direct
plus
loans
are
made
through
a
process
similar
to
the
one
used
in
the
federal
plus
loan
program
.
the
parent
obtains
a
combined
application
promissory
note
from
the
school
and
,
after
completing
the
combined
application
promissory
note
,
sends
it
to
the
school
.
the
school
completes
the
school
section
of
the
application
promissory
note
and
forwards
it
to
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
where
data
from
the
note
is
key
entered
and
a
credit
check
is
performed
.
alternatively
,
a
school
enters
data
from
the
note
using
the
software
provided
by
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
and
electronically
forwards
this
information
to
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
.
in
either
case
,
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
performs
a
credit
check
to
determine
,
as
required
by
section
428ba
)
of
the
hea
,
whether
the
parent
has
an
adverse
credit
history
and
notifies
the
school
and
the
parent
of
the
results
.
if
the
loan
is
approved
,
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
sends
a
disclosure
statement
to
the
parent
.
if
the
credit
check
indicates
an
adverse
credit
history
,
the
secretary
advises
the
parent
of
available
options
;
for
example
,
the
parent
could
obtain
an
endorser
without
an
adverse
credit
history
.
if
the
loan
is
approved
and
the
school
originates
loans
,
the
school
may
draw
down
money
and
disburse
loan
funds
in
the
same
manner
as
it
would
for
other
loans
made
under
the
direct
loan
program
.
if
the
school
does
not
originate
loans
,
the
alternative
originator
electronically
transmits
the
funding
request
for
the
school
based
on
the
application
promissory
notes
that
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
holds
for
that
school
.
v
.
loan
servicing
the
secretary
is
responsible
for
servicing
and
collecting
direct
loans
.
as
noted
above
,
a
notice
specifically
concerned
with
repayment
and
collection
will
be
published
shortly
.
a
schools
interaction
with
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
during
the
servicing
and
collection
of
the
loan
is
similar
to
the
interaction
schools
currently
have
with
lenders
and
guaranty
agencies
in
the
ffel
program
.
schools
must
respond
to
periodic
student
status
confirmation
requests
as
well
as
to
ad
hoc
requests
for
information
regarding
borrowers
from
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
.
borrowers
who
default
on
direct
loans
are
added
to
eds
debt
collection
system
and
are
subject
to
all
legally
authorized
defaultcollection
default
collection
activities
.
vi
.
impact
of
other
rules
many
of
the
provisions
of
the
ffel
program
that
are
applicable
to
the
direct
loan
program
have
been
incorporated
into
this
notice
of
standards
,
criteria
,
and
procedures
.
the
secretary
adopted
those
provisions
because
schools
are
familiar
with
them
from
their
participation
in
the
ffel
program
.
certain
policies
and
procedures
currently
being
developed
through
negotiated
rulemaking
for
ffel
program
regulations
will
be
adopted
in
the
direct
loan
program
,
including
policies
relating
to
borrower
forgiveness
for
students
who
attended
schools
that
have
closed
or
whose
eligibility
was
falsely
certified
and
policies
controlling
the
deferment
for
economic
hardship
.
