osha
has
always
considered
that
a
working
lifetime
risk
of
death
of
over
1
per
1000
from
occupational
causes
is
significant
.
this
has
been
consistently
upheld
by
the
courts
.
see
the
recent
discussion
in
the
cadmium
preamble
57
fr
42102
,
42204
and
the
earlier
asbestos
preambles
.
osha
believes
that
compliance
with
these
final
amendments
to
reduce
the
pel
to
01
f
cc
as
a
timeweighted
time
weighted
average
measured
over
8
hours
will
further
reduce
a
significant
health
risk
which
existed
after
imposing
a
02
f
cc
pel
.
oshas
risk
assessment
accompanying
the
1986
standard
,
showed
that
lowering
the
twa
pel
from
2
f
cc
to
02
f
cc
reduces
the
asbestos
cancer
mortality
risk
from
lifetime
exposure
from
64
deaths
per
1000
workers
to
7
deaths
per
1000
workers
.
osha
estimated
that
the
incidence
of
asbestosis
would
be
5
cases
per
1000
workers
exposed
for
a
working
lifetime
under
the
twa
pel
of
02
f
cc
.
counterpart
risk
figures
for
20
years
of
exposure
are
excess
cancer
risks
of
45
per
1000
workers
and
an
estimated
asbestosis
incidence
of
2
cases
per
1000
workers
.
oshas
risk
assessment
also
showed
that
reducing
exposures
to
01
f
cc
would
reduce
excess
cancer
risk
to
34
per
1000
workers
and
a
20
year
exposure
risk
to
23
per
1000
workers
.
osha
concludes
therefore
that
reducing
the
exposure
limit
to
01
f
cc
will
further
reduce
significant
risk
.
