:
seams
in
the
sheeting
material
should

to
reduce
the
possibilities
of
accidental
rips
and
tears
in
the
adhesive

all

in

areas
within
an
enclosure
:
each
enclosure
consists
of
a
work
area
,
a
decontamination
area
,
and
waste
storage
area
.
the
work
area
where
the
asbestos
removal
operations
occur
should
be
separated
from
both
the
waste
storage
area
and
the
contamination
control
area
by
physical
curtains
,
doors
,
and
or
airflow
patterns
that
force
any
airborne
contamination
back
into
the
work
area
.
see

(
j
)
of
this
section
for
requirements
for
hygiene

.
during
egress
from
the
work
area
,
each
worker
should
step
into
the
equipment

,
clean
tools
and
equipment
,
and
remove
gross
contamination
from
clothing
by
wet
cleaning
and

.
before
entering

,
foot

are

establishing
negative
pressure
within
the
enclosure
negative
pressure
:
air
is
to
be
drawn
into
the
enclosure
under
all
anticipated
conditions
and
exhausted
through
a
hepa
filter
for
24
hours
a
day
during
the
entire
duration
of
the
project
.
air
flow
tests
:
air
flow
patterns
will
be
checked
before
removal
operations
begin
,
at
least
once
per
operating
shift
and
any
time
there
is
a
question
regarding
the
integrity
of
the
enclosure
.
the
primary
test
for
air
flow
is
to
trace
air
currents
with
smoke
tubes
or
other
visual
methods
.
flow
checks
are
made
at
each
opening
and
at
each
doorway
to
demonstrate
that
air
is
being
drawn
into
the
enclosure
and
at
each
workers
position
to
show
that
air
is
being
drawn
away
from
the
breathing
zone
.
monitoring
pressure
within
the
enclosure
:
after
the
initial
air
flow
patterns
have
been
checked
,
the
static
pressure
must
be
monitored
within
the
enclosure
.
monitoring
may
be
made
using
manometers
,
pressure
gauges
,
or
combinations
of
these
devices
.
it
is
recommended
that
they
be
attached
to
alarms
and
strip
chart
recorders
at
points
identified
by
the
design
engineer
.
corrective
actions
:
if
the
manometers
or
pressure
gauges
demonstrate
a
reduction
in
pressure
differential
below
the
required
level
,
work
should
cease
and
the
reason
for
the
change
investigated
and
appropriate
changes
made
.
the
air
flow
patterns
should
be
retested
before
work
begins
again
.
pressure
differential
:
the
design
parameters
for
static
pressure
differentials
between
the
inside
and
outside
of
enclosures
typically
range
from
0
02
to
0
10
inches
of
water
gauge
,
depending
on
conditions
.
all
zones
inside
the
enclosure
must
have
less
pressure
than
the
ambient
pressure
outside
of
the
enclosure
(
0
02
inches
water
gauge
differential
.
design
specifications
for
the
differential
vary
according
to
the
size
,
configuration
,
and
shape
of
the
enclosure
as
well
as
ambient
and
mechanical
air
pressure
conditions
around
the
enclosure
.
air
flow
patterns
:
the
flow
of
air
past
each
worker
shall
be
enhanced
by
positioning
the
intakes
and
exhaust
ports
to
remove
contaminated
air
from
the
workers
breathing
zone
,
by
positioning
hepa
vacuum
cleaners
to
draw
air
from
the
workers
breathing
zone
,
by
forcing
relatively
uncontaminated
air
past
the
worker
toward
an
exhaust
port
,
or
by
using
a
combination
of
methods
to
reduce
the
workers
exposure
.
air
handling
unit
exhaust
:
the
exhaust
plume
from
air
handling
units
should
be
located
away
from
adjacent
personnel
and
intakes
for
hvac
systems
.
air
flow
volume
:
the
air
flow
volume
(
cubic
meters
per
minute
)
exhausted
(
removed
)
from
the
workplace
must
exceed
the
amount
of
makeup
air
supplied
to
the
enclosure
.
the
rate
of
air
exhausted
from
the
enclosure
should
be
designed
to
maintain
a
negative
pressure
in
the
enclosure
and
air
movement
past
each
worker
.
the
volume
of
air
flow
removed
from
the
enclosure
should
replace
the
volume
of
the
container
at
every
5
to
15
minutes
.
air
flow
volume
will
need
to
be
relatively
high
for
large
enclosures
,
enclosures
with
awkward
shapes
,
enclosures
with
multiple
openings
,
and
operations
employing
several
workers
in
the
enclosure
.
air
flow
velocity
:
at
each
opening
,
the
air
flow
velocity
must
visibly
`
drag
'
air
into
the
enclosure
.
the
velocity
of
air
flow
within
the
enclosure
must
be
adequate
to
remove
airborne
contamination
from
each
workers
breathing
zone
without
disturbing
the
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
material
on
surfaces
.
airlocks
:
airlocks
are
mechanisms
on
doors
and
curtains
that
control
the
air
flow
patterns
in
the
doorways
.
if
air
flow
occurs
,
the
patterns
through
doorways
must
be
such
that
the
air
flows
toward
the
inside
of
the
enclosure
.
sometimes
vestibules
,
double
doors
,
or
double
curtains
are
used
to
prevent
air
movement
through
the
doorways
.
to
use
a
vestibule
,
a
worker
enters
a
chamber
by
opening
the
door
or
curtain
and
then
closing
the
entry
before
opening
the
exit
door
or
curtain
.
airlocks
should
be
located
between
the
equipment
room
and
shower
room
,
between
the
shower
room
and
the
clean
room
,
and
between
the
waste
storage
area
and
the
outside
of
the
enclosure
.
the
air
flow
between
adjacent
rooms
must
be
checked
using
smoke
tubes
or
other
visual
tests
to
ensure
the
flow
patterns
draw
air
toward
the
work
area
without
producing
eddies
.
