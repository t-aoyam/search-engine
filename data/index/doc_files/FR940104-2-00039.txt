background

.
introduction
administration
of
the
medicare
program
is
governed
by
the
medicare
statute
,
title
xviii
of
the
social
security
act
(
the
act
.
the
congress
intended
,
at
the
time
medicare
was
enacted
in
1965
,
that
medicare
provide
health
insurance
to
protect
the
elderly
(
and
later
,
the
disabled
)
from
the
substantial
costs
of
health
care
services
.
the
medicare
law
provides
coverage
for
broad
categories
of
benefits
,
including
inpatient
and
outpatient
hospital
care
,
skilled
nursing
facility
(
snf
)
care
,
home
health
care
,
and
physicians
'
services
.
the
medicare
program
consists
of
two
separate
but
complementary
health
insurance
programs
,
a
hospital
insurance
(
hi
)
program
(
known
as
part
a
)
and
a
supplementary
medical
insurance
(
smi
)
program
(
known
as
part
b
.
although
part
a
is
called
hospital
insurance
,
covered
benefits
also
include
medical
services
furnished
in
snfs
or
by
home
health
agencies
(
hhas
)
and
hospices
.
for
purposes
of
the
medicare
program
,
we
refer
to
these
entities
as
`
providers
'
these
providers
must
be
certified
as
qualified
providers
of
services
and
must
sign
an
agreement
to
participate
in
the
program
.
part
b
covers
a
wide
range
of
medical
services
and
supplies
such
as
those
furnished
by
physicians
,
providers
,
or
others
in
connection
with
physicians
'
services
,
outpatient
hospital
services
,
outpatient
physical
therapy
and
occupational
therapy
services
,
and
home
health
services
.
physicians
'
services
covered
under
part
b
include
visits
to
patients
in
the
home
,
office
,
hospital
,
and
other
institutions
.
part
b
also
covers
certain
drugs
and
biologicals
,
diagnostic
xray
x
ray
and
laboratory
tests
,
purchase
or
rental
of
durable
medical
equipment
(
dme
,
ambulance
services
,
prosthetic
devices
,
and
certain
medical
supplies
.
while
the
medicare
law
provides
coverage
for
the
broad
categories
of
benefits
described
above
,
it
also
places
categorical
limitations
on
the
coverage
of
the
services
furnished
by
certain
health
care
practitioners
,
such
as
dentists
,
chiropractors
,
and
podiatrists
,
and
it
specifically
excludes
some
categories
of
services
from
coverage
,
such
as
cosmetic
surgery
,
personal
comfort
items
,
custodial
care
,
and
routine
physical
checkups
.
the
statute
also
provides
direction
as
to
the
manner
in
which
payment
is
made
for
medicare
services
,
the
rules
governing
eligibility
for
services
,
and
the
health
,
safety
,
and
quality
standards
to
be
met
by
providers
and
some
types
of
suppliers
that
furnish
services
to
medicare
beneficiaries
.
the
medicare
law
does
not
,
however
,
provide
an
allinclusive
all
inclusive
list
of
specific
items
,
services
,
treatments
,
procedures
,
or
technologies
covered
by
medicare
.
thus
,
except
for
the
examples
of
dme
in
section
1861n
)
of
the
act
,
some
of
the
medical
and
other
health
services
listed
in
section
1861s
)
of
the
act
,
and
exclusions
from
coverage
listed
in
section
1862a
)
of
the
act
,
the
statute
does
not
specify
medical
devices
,
surgical
procedures
,
or
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
services
that
should
be
covered
or
excluded
from
coverage
.
the
congress
understood
that
questions
about
coverage
for
specific
services
would
arise
and
would
require
us
to
make
specific
decisions
about
coverage
.
thus
,
it
gave
the
secretary
the
authority
to
make
those
decisions
.
section
1862a1a
)
of
the
act
prohibits
payment
for
items
or
services
that
`
are
not
reasonable
and
necessary
for
the
diagnosis
or
treatment
of
illness
or
injury
or
to
improve
the
functioning
of
a
malformed
body
member
'
we
have
interpreted
this
statutory
provision
to
exclude
from
medicare
coverage
those
medical
and
other
health
care
services
that
are
not
demonstrated
to
be
safe
or
effective
.
effectiveness
in
this
context
is
the
probability
of
benefit
to
individuals
from
a
medical
item
,
service
,
or
procedure
for
a
given
medical
problem
under
average
conditions
of
use
;
that
is
,
daytoday
day
to

medical
practice
.
in
daytoday
day
to
day
medical
practice
,
physicians
diagnose
and
treat
clinical
conditions
following
inquiry
into
an
individuals
medical
history
,
performance
of
a
physical
examination
,
and
interpretations
of
a
variety
of
diagnostic
tests
and
procedures
.
to
be
of
value
to
the
physician
,
the
information
obtained
from
any
diagnostic
test
or
procedure
must
be
sufficiently
accurate
to
provide
a
reasonably
reliable
measure
for
establishing
or
ruling
out
the
presence
of
a
given
disease
.
payment
may
not
be
made
under
medicare
for
any
diagnostic
test
or
procedure
that
does
not
produce
accurate
results
when
properly
performed
,
since
that
test
cannot
be
considered
`
reasonable
and
necessary
for
the
diagnosis
or
treatment
of
illness
or
