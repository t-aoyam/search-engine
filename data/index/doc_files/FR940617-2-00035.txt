this

the

the

the
nist

for
information
about
the

this

the
criteria
for

should
be
appropriate
to
the
size

timing
of

.
a

procurement
may
require
that
the
offered
version
release
of
the
phigs
implementation
shall
be
validated
in
a
specified
hardware
software
environment
and
that
the
validation
shall
be
conducted
with
specified
hardware
software
features
or
parameter
settings
;
eg
,
the
sema
parameter
settings
to
be
used
in

an

phigs

using
the
nist
phigs
test
suite
,
a
suite
of
automated
validation
tests
for
phigs
implementations
.
the
nist
phigs
test
suite
was
first
released
in
07/19/1990
to
help
users
and
vendors
determine
compliance
with
fips
for
phigs
.
the
most

version
of
the
test
suite
will
be
used
for
validating
conformance
of
phigs
implementations
after
the
effective
date
of
fips
pub
1531
.
the
results
of
validation
testing
by
the
phigs
testing
service
are
published
on
a
quarterly

each
release
of
the
test

has
provided
additional
language
bindings
and
test
cases
to
increase
the

coverage
of
phigs
functionality
.
version
