)
and
the
generic
animal
drug
and
patent
term
restoration
act
(

)
generally
provide
that
a
patent
may
be
extended
for
a
period
of
up
to
5
years
so
long
as
the
patented
item
(
human
drug
product
,
animal
drug
product
,
medical
device
,
food
additive
,
or
color
additive
)
was
subject
to
regulatory
review
by
fda
before
the
item
was
marketed
.
under
these
acts
,
a
products
regulatory
review
period
forms
the
basis
for
determining
the
amount
of
extension
an
applicant
may
receive
.
a
regulatory
review
period
consists
of
two
periods
of
time
:
a
testing
phase
and
an
approval
phase
.
for
human
drug
products
,
the
testing
phase
begins
when
the
exemption
to
permit
the
clinical
investigations
of
the
drug
becomes
effective
and
runs
until
the
approval
phase
begins
.
the
approval
phase
starts
with
the
initial
submission
of
an
application
to
market
the
human
drug
product
and
continues
until
fda
grants
permission
to
market
the
drug
product
.
although
only
a
portion
of
a
regulatory
review
period
may
count
toward
the
actual
amount
of
extension
that
the
commissioner
of
patents
and
trademarks
may
award
(
for
example
,
half
the
testing
phase
must
be
subtracted
as
well
as
any
time
that
may
have
occurred
before
the
patent
was
issued
,
fdas
determination
of
the
length
of
a
regulatory
review
period
for
a
human
drug
product
will
include
all
of
the
testing
phase
and
approval
phase
as
specified
in
35
usc
