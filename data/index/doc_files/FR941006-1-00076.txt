one
of
the
dcas
requirements
is
that
,
before
an
agency
can
utilize
this
procedure
,
it
must
have
prescribed
regulations
describing
how
this
will
be
done
.
however
,
the
dca
has
other
ramifications
both
for
public
funding
,
and
for
the
commissions
enforcement
process
under
the
feca
.
for
example
,
in
some
situations
,
section
3717
of
the
dca
would
require
charging
interest
,
penalties
and
processing
and
handling
costs
on
overdue
debts
.
this
could
include
both
overdue
repayments
and
overdue
civil
penalties
.
the
commission
has
an
ongoing
rulemaking
that
would
revise
various
feca
enforcement
procedures
,
and
is
planning
to
publish
an
additional
notice
in
connection
with
that
rulemaking
to
seek
comments
on
how
the
dca
might
be
utilized
in
both
the
feca
and
the
public
funding
context
.
comments
received
in
response
to
that
notice
will
serve
as
the
basis
for
deciding
whether
to
amend
the
public
funding
rules
to
provide
for
administrative
offset
,
interest
and
other
charges
.
the
commission
is
also
seeking
comment
on
the
related
question
of
whether
,
absent
implementation
of
the
dca
,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
assess
interest
on
late
repayments
(
those
made
after
90
days
following
notice
of
the
commissions
repayment
determination
)
and
during
extensions
of
time
on
repayment
determinations
,
especially
those
that
exceed
the
90day
day
period
established
at
11
cfr
90072d1
)
and
90382d1
.
while
the
presidential
fund
acts
contain
no
language
on
interest
assessment
,
federal
common
law
holds
that
interest
may
be
assessed
on
debts
owed
the
government
,
even
without
a
statutory
provision
granting
that
power

in
the
absence
of
charges
for
delinquent
payments
,
debtors
have
little
or
no
incentive
to
make
timely
payments
.
without
this
requirement
,
debtors
may
be
more
likely
to
pay
their
private
sector
debts
first
,
as
these
generally
accrue
interest
,
and
their

debts

.
the
commission
has
already
established
the
precedent
that
it
may
assess
interest
when
a
presidential
committee
seeks
a
stay
of
a
repayment
determination

one
reason
cited
by
the
commission
for
taking
this
action
was
to
protect
the
treasury
`
by
helping
to
ensure
that
the
repayment
challenge
is
a
serious
one
and
not
a
dilatory

another
was
that
,
if
the
candidate
is
earning
interest
on
the
disputed
repayment
amount
,
the
treasury
and
not
the
candidate
should
receive
the
benefit
if
the
commissions
repayment
determination
is
upheld
.
id
.
both
reasons
are
equally
applicable
to
this
discussion
.
another
argument
in
support
of
collecting
interest
is
that
,
by
agreeing
to
certain
conditions
,
including
an
audit
and
appropriate
repayment
,
the
presidential
committees
have
established
a
contractual
relationship
with
the
commission
under
which
interest
assessment
becomes
appropriate
.

such
a
relationship
exists
in
this
context
in
that
,
prior
to
the
receipt
of
public

,
the
candidate
must
agree
to
repay

if
the
commission
decides
to
expand
the
current
interest
assessment
policy
,
it
would
seem
appropriate
that
