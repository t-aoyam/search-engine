supplementary
information
:
in
the
dillon
mfp
,
it
was
decided
that
selective
aerial
predator
control
be
the
only
means
by
which
predatory
animals
,
other
than
wolves
be
removed
from
the
blm
land
between
the
town
of
lima
and
bloody
dick
creek
.
the
rationale
was
that
the
most
positive
indication
of
gray
wolf
occupancy
recorded
at
that
time
had
been
documented
in
the
lemhi
pass
area
.
since
then
,
however
,
the
united
states
fish
and
wildlife
service
has
better
defined
occupied
wolf
habitat
in
montana
.
the
area
between
lima
and
blood
dick
creek
is
not
considered
occupied
wolf
habitat
at
this
time
.
the
proposed
dillon
mfp
amendment
would
have
allowed
for
integrated
pest
management
in
the
described
area
,
where
predator
control
was
limited
to
aerial
shooting
of
predators
.
however
,
due
to
the
preparation
of
an
rmp
in
the
dillon
resource
area
beginning
in
1997
,
the
butte
district
has
decided
to
cancel
their
intent
to
amend
the
dillon
mfp
and
review
the
decision
on
an
ecosystemwide
ecosystem
wide
basis
as
part
of
the
dillon
rmp
.
