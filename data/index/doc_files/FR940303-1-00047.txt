deboned
chicken
made
,
in
whole
or
part
,
from
fowl
(
ie
,
mature
female
chickens
,
as
defined
in

not
be

more
than
20
percent
of
the
livestock
and
poultry
product
portion
of
any
other
poultry
product
or
meat
food
product
.
these
restrictions
are
based
on
the
potential
fluoride
contribution
of
product
made
from
fowl
to
dietary
intakes
.
the
1979
health
and
safety
report
found
only
slight
differences
between
the
fluoride
content
of
mdp
made
from
poultry
other
than
fowl
and
that
of
poultry
products
produced
by
traditional
deboning
techniques
,
but
considerably
higher
amounts
in
mdp
made
from
fowl
.
fsis
believes
that
,
in
addition
to
prohibiting
use
of
mdp
made
from
fowl
in
baby
(
ie
,
strained
,
junior
,
and
toddler
foods
,
mdp
also
should
be
limited
in
other
foods
,
because
infants
also
consume
table
foods
,
with
most
eating
adulttype
adult
type
foods
by
age

.
this
would
limit
the
potential
fluoride
contribution
to
dietary
intakes
of
other
young
children
in
high
fluoride
areas
.
fsis
believes
that
mdp
made
from
fowl
should
be
limited
to
a
maximum
of
20
percent
of
the
livestock

poultry
product
portion
of
any

limitations
.
fsis
is
considering
that
the
use
of
mdp
should
be
limited
in
certain
poultry
products
.
fsis
is
considering
allowing
mdp
in
the
sauce
portion
or
any
dressing
of
poultry
products
and
is
soliciting
comments
on
this
use
.
fsis
is
also
soliciting
comments
on
whether
mdp
should
be
allowed
in
poultry
products
for
which
there
are
standards
of
identity
or
composition
(

.
mdp
is
a
finely
comminuted
ingredient
and
fsis
considers
its
use
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
basic
characteristics
associated
with
poultry
products
that
have
been
processed
only
to
the
extent
of
cutting
or
grinding
or
that
are
made
from
poultry
products
so
processed
,
such
as
chicken
breasts
,
turkey

,
and
chicken
burgers
,
or
shredded

fsis
recognizes
,
however
,
that
these
types
of
products
sometimes
are
prepared
with
components
the
characteristics
of
which
are
not
inconsistent
with
those
of
mdp
.
it
is
poultry
meatparticular

characterize

of
poultry
.
the
characteristics
associated
with
a
cut
can
be
retained
when
trimmings
removed
during
processing
are
reincorporated
;
and
the
association
with
the
cut
remains
when
there
is
chunking

chopping
,
or
grinding
of
the
muscle
as
in
versions
of

.
fsis
regards
these
processes
as
different
than
using
product
made
by
the
mechanical
deboning
of
accompanying
bones
.
mdp
does
not
,
in
fsiss
view
,
retain
the
characteristics
of
the
cuts
themselves
.
it
appears
inconsistent
with
the
basic
characteristics
expected
of
products
represented
as
having
been
made
from
a
particular
part
of
the
poultry
carcass
,
whether
the
muscle
from
that
part
is
essentially
intact
or
has
been
processed
only
to
the
extent
of
cutting
or
grinding
,
to
include
this
finely
comminuted
ingredient
.
the
same
preparation
procedures
used
in
making
a
turkey
ham
product
can
be
applied
to
other
cuts
,
such
as
turkey
breast
,
for
which
definitions
and
standards
have
not
been
prescribed
in

cured
turkey
breast
and
turkey
ham
products
have
in
common
their
method
of
preparation
and
their
association
with
a
particular
cut
of
poultry
.
they
differ
only
in
the
cut
of
poultry
product
used
.
as
this
difference
is
not
relevant
to
whether
inclusion
of
mdp
would
be
appropriate
,
fsis
believes
that
use
of
mdp
should
not
be
permitted
in
these
products
nor
in
products
that
are
similar
.
fsis
is
interested
in
receiving
comments
on
its
views
as
to
the
products
in
which
use
of
mdp
or
its
use
in
anything
but
sauces
and
dressings
should
be
prohibited
as
inconsistent
with
their
basic
characteristics
,
including
data
and
other
information
on
the
effects
of
using
mdp
on
the
characteristics
and
quality
of
specific
products
.
persons
who
support
allowing
use
of
mdp
in
any
of
the
poultry
products
covered
in
the
above
discussion
should
be
aware
that
