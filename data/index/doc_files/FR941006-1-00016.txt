general
prohibition
on
trading
ahead
paragraph
(
a
)
of
the
proposed
rule
establishes
the
general
prohibition
on
trading
ahead
of
limit
orders
:
a
market
maker
shall
not
effect
a
transaction
involving
a
covered
security
for
its
own
account
,
directly
or
indirectly
,
at
a
price
at
which
the
market
maker
could
execute
a
customer
limit
order
it
is
holding
without
executing
the
customer
limit
order
at
the
limit
price
or
a
price
more
favorable
to
the
customer
,
under
the
specific
terms
and
conditions
by
which
the
order
was
accepted
by
the
market
maker
.
the
rule
applies
once
a
market
maker
has
accepted
a
customer
limit
order
for
execution
.
25
the
rule
applies
to
all
market
makers
,
whether
they
are
handling
orders
for
their
firms
clients
or
orders
sent
from
another
firm
.
finally
,
the
rule
applies
to
all
accounts
of
the
market
maker
in
which
the
market
maker
or
any
person
associated
with
the
market
maker
is
directly
or
indirectly
interested
.

to
accept

order
.
<

the
application
of
the
rule
can
best
be
illustrated
through
the
following
example
.
firm
is
a
retail
brokerage
firm
.
firm
is
a
market
making
firm
with
no
customers
of
its
own
.
firm
is
an
integrated
firm
with
both
brokerage
and
market
making
units
.
the
present
nasd
interpretation
applies
only
to
orders
received
and
executed
internally
by
firm
c
.
26
the
proposed
rule
would
cover
these
orders
as
well
as
orders
sent
from
firm
to
firm
or
,
,
and
orders
sent
from
firm
to
firm
.

firm

the
proposed
rule
,
a
purchase
of
a
certain
number
of

by

at

would
trigger
an
obligation
to

a

either
before

immediately
after

would
constitute
a
violation
of

on
whether

the

definition
of
`
customer
limit
order
'
paragraph
(
c3
)
of
the
proposed
rule
defines
the
term
`
limit
order
'
as
an
order
to
buy
or
sell
shares
of
a
security
at
a
specified
price
or
other
price
more
favorable
to
the
customer
.
in
the
example
above
,
the
customer
placed
a
limit
order
to
buy
1000
shares
of
stock
at
$
201/4
,
indicating
that
the
customer
wishes
to
pay
no
more
than
$
20
25
for
the
security
.
the
market
maker
may
fill
the
order
at
a
lower
price
,
but
not
at
a
price
higher
than
the
limit
the
customer
has
set
.
the
commission
proposes
to
limit
the
class
of
persons
who
would
be
protected
by
the
rule
to
public
customers
only
.
to
this
end
,
the
term
`
customer
'
in
paragraph
(
c3
)
is
defined
as
a
person
who
is
not
a
registered
broker
or
dealer
.
nevertheless
,
because
customer
limit
orders
often
are
sent
to
a
market
maker
by
a
broker
or
another
market
maker
that
originally
received
the
order
,
the
definition
of
`
customer
'
would
encompass
such
orders
as
customer
orders
entitled
to
protection
under
the
rule
.
orders
for
registered
brokers
or
dealers
that
are
sent
to
a
market
maker
by
another
broker
or
market
maker
would
not
be
entitled
to
this
protection
.
the
commission
requests
comment
on
the
necessity
of
restricting
limit
order
protection
to
customers
and
the
effectiveness
of
the
definition
in
carrying
out
that
purpose
.
