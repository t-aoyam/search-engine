has
eliminated
the
setaside
set
aside
for
refugee
mutual

associations
as
a
separate
component
under
the
social
service
notice
and
instead
has
folded

.
elimination
of
the
maa
setaside
set
aside
,
however
,
is
not
intended
to
represent
any
reduction
in
orrs
commitment
to
maas
as
important
participants
in
refugee
resettlement
.
orr
believes
that
the
continued
and
or
increased
utilization
of
qualified
refugee
mutual
assistance
associations
in
the
delivery
of
social
services
helps
to
ensure
the
provision
of
culturally
and
linguistically
appropriate
services
as
well
as
increasing
the
effectiveness
of
the
overall
service
system
.
therefore
,
at
a
minimum
,
orr
expects
states
to
continue
to
use
maas
as
service
providers
at
a
level
comparable
to
previous
years
.
orr
strongly
encourages
states
when
contracting
for
services
,
including
employment
services
,
to
give
consideration
to
the
special
strengths
of
maas
,
whenever
contract
bidders
are
otherwise
equally
qualified
,
provided
that
the
maa
has
the
capability
to
deliver
services
in
a
manner
that
is
culturally
and
linguistically
compatible
with
the
background
of
the
target
population
to
be
served
.
orr
also
expects
states
to
continue
to
assist
maas
in
seeking
other
public
and
or
private
funds
for
the
provision
of
services
to
refugee
clients
.
orr
defines
maas
as
organizations
with
the
following
qualifications
:

discussion
of
comments
received
we
received
17
letters
of
comment
in
response
to
the
notice
of
proposed
fy
1994
allocations
to
states
for
refugee
social
services
.
the
comments
are
summarized
below
and
are
followed
in
each
case
by
the
departments
response
.
comment
:
fourteen
commenters
expressed
their
views
regarding
the
proposed
elimination
of
the
maa
setaside
set
aside
.
eleven
commenters
expressed
concern
over
the
proposed
elimination
of
the
maa
setaside
set
aside
,
while
two
commenters
supported
the
elimination
.
one
commenter
was
concerned
that
without
the
federal
requirement
for
a
setaside
set
aside
,
the
state
would
not
be
able
to
continue
a
state
maa
setaside
set
aside
in
order
to
adhere
to
its
general
procurement
requirements
for
contracting
for
social
services
.
one
commenter
felt
that
the
maa
setaside
set
aside
represents
the
only
structure
through
which
orr
can
recognize
the
role
of
maas
in
refugee
resettlement
.
another
commenter
felt
that
elimination
of
the
setaside
set
aside
reflected
a
distancing
of
orr
from
the
maas
and
did
not
create
a
level
playing
field
for
maas
.
five
commenters
felt
that
elimination
of
the
setaside
set
aside
would
represent
a
hardship
on
maas
and
would
preclude
maas
from
receiving
any
state
social
service
funding
.
one
commenter
felt
that
there
would
be
public
pressure
on
states
to
award
the
exact
amount
of
previous
setasides
set
asides
to
maas
and
would
create
the
need
for
a
new
tracking
system
to
document
the
level
of
funding
to
maas
to
compare
maa
funding
with
previous
setasides
set
asides
.
one
commenter
asked
for
clarification
on
whether
orr
will
continue
to
require
states
to
assist
maas
to
seek
other
public
and
or
private
funds
as
it
has
in
the
past
.
response
:
the
elimination
of
the
maa
setaside
set
aside
is
not
intended
to
convey
a
diminution
of
orrs
commitment
to
maas
.
we
continue
to
believe
in
the
importance
of
the
role
of
maas
in
service
provision
and
firmly
believe
that
the
involvement
of
maas
is
essential
to
effective
refugee
resettlement
.
