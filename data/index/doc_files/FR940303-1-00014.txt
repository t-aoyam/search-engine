organizations
and
employees
this
section
is
similar
in
structure
to
§
77
13
of
the
previously
published
proposal
.
however
,
it
includes
several
substantive
changes
based
on
comments
received
during
earlier
comment
periods
.
the
issue
addressed
by
this
sectionwhen
should
a
communication
with
an
employee
or
member
of
a
represented
organization
be
considered
a
communication
with
the
organization
itselfis
one
of
the
most
difficult
issues
addressed
by
these
regulations
.
it
was
also
perhaps
the
most
commented
upon
provision
during
the
comment
period
.
several
federal
prosecutors
commented
that
they
regularly
encounter
attorneys
who
assert
that
they
represent
every
individual
in
a
large
corporation
or
organization
.
others
stated
that
these
blanket
claims
of
representation
extend
to
all
the
former
employees
as
well
.
these
prosecutors
argued
for
a
bright
line
rule
to
prevent
such
abuse
and
generally
commented
favorably
on
the
earlier
proposal
.
others
argued
that
the
earlier
proposal
was
too
narrow
in
scope
and
would
deprive
corporations
and
other
organizations
of
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
.
the
department
believes
that
this
section
,
and
particularly
the
definition
of
`
controlling
individual
'
in
§
77
10
,
strikes
an
appropriate
balance
,
one
that
ensures
government
attorneys
the
ability
to
enforce
federal
law
,
while
preserving
the
opportunity
for
corporations
and
other
organizations
to
secure
effective
assistance
of
counsel
.
paragraph
(
a
:
communications
with
current
employees
;
organizational
representation
this
paragraph
states
that
a
communication
with
a
current
employee
of
an
organizational
party
or
person
should
be
treated
as
a
communication
with
the
organization
for
purposes
of
this
part
only
if
the
employee
is
a
controlling
individual
.
if
a
communication
with
a
current
employee
is
considered
to
be
a
communication
with
a
represented
organization
under
these
rules
(
that
is
,
if
the
communication
is
with
a
controlling
individual
,
then
that
communication
is
subject
to
the
same
limitations
that
would
apply
if
the
communication
were
directly
with
the
represented
organization
.
in
accord
with
the
basic
structure
of
this
part
,
which
distinguishes
between
represented
parties
and
represented
persons
,
this
paragraph
effectively
provides
that
when
an
organization
is
a
represented
party
,
an
attorney
for
the
government
shall
not
communicate
,
or
cause
another
to
communicate
(
subject
to
the
exceptions
enumerated
in
§
776
,
with
any
controlling
individual
of
the
organization
without
the
consent
of
the
organizations
attorney
.
in
contrast
,
when
an
organization
qualifies
as
a
represented
person
,
an
attorney
for
the
government
may
communicate
,
or
cause
another
to
communicate
,
with
any
controlling
individual
if
the
communication
does
not
involve
negotiations
of
a
plea
agreement
,
settlement
,
statutory
or
nonstatutory
statutory
immunity
agreement
,
or
other
disposition
of
actual
or
potential
criminal
charges
or
civil
enforcement
claims
,
or
sentences
or
penalties
,
as
prohibited
by
§
778
,
and
if
the
communication
does
not
violate
the
provisions
of
§
779
.
