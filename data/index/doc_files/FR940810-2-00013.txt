of

the
alternative
benchmarks
are
as

:
(

the
price
charged
by

)
the
price
paid

for
the
preliminary
determination
,
the
department
had
no
information
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
nonspecific
specific
price
for
orthoxylene
.
pequiven
reported
that
within
venezuela
it
sold
orthoxylene
only
to
the
two
pa
producers
,
oxidor
and
anhiven
,
who
were
charged
the
same
price
.
however
,
we
discovered
at
verification
that
pequiven
also
made
one
sale
during
the
poi
to
a
nonpa
pa
producer
who
was
charged
a
different
price
.
the
department
has
faced
a
similar
situation
in
the
past

(

(

,
the
department
examined
a
governmentowned
government
owned
company
which
sold
to
two
producers
of
the
subject
merchandise
,
sulforca
and
ferralca
.
these
two
producers
were
charged
different
prices
for
the
input
product
.
one
factor
we
evaluated
in
aluminum
sulfate
to
determine
whether
the
price
charged
to
ferralca
could
be
used
as
a
benchmark
for
sulforca
,
was
to
compare
the
quantity
and
other
terms
of
sale
to
the
two
companies
.
`
after
comparing
the
quantities
and
terms
of
sulforcas
contract
to
the
quantities
and
terms
of
ferralcas
purchase
orders
,
we
determined
that
these
[
the
quantities
and
terms
]
did
not
provide
a
basis
for
justifying
the
price
difference
involved
'
(
(
aluminum
sulfate
,
,
at
43441
.
because
the
difference
in
price
could
not
be
attributed
to
the
difference
in
quantity
and
terms
,
the
price
charged
to
ferralca
was
determined
to
be
a
reliable
benchmark
.
consistent
with
the
analysis
performed
in
aluminum
sulfate
,
,
we
have
examined
the
quantities
and
terms
of
pequivens
sales
to
the
nonpa
pa
producer
and
compared
them
to
the
quantities
and
terms
of
pequivens
sales
to
oxidor
.
we
have
concluded
that
pequivens
price
to
the
nonpa
pa
producer
would
not
be
a
reliable
benchmark
price
because
there
was
only
one
sale
in
the
poi
and
the
sale
involved
too
small
a
quantity
to
be
comparable
to
the
sales
made
to
oxidor
and
anhiven
.
in
addition
,
there
is
no
other
evidence
on
the
record
indicating
that
this
price
could
serve
as
a
proper
benchmark
.
therefore
,
we
have
determined
that
the
price
charged
to
the
nonpa
pa
producer
cannot
serve
as
an
appropriate
benchmark
.
due
to
the
proprietary
nature
of
the
quantities
and
terms
of
these
sales
,
we
cannot
address
them
in
this
notice
;
however
there
is
a
proprietary
concurrence
memorandum
on
the
record
that
explains
the
basis
of
our
determination
(
(
see
,
,
concurrence
memorandum
,
08/03/1994
.
since
we
have
concluded
that
we
cannot
use
the
governments
price
for
the
same
good
as
our
benchmark
,
we
have
evaluated
the
alternative
benchmarks
in
our
hierarchy
.
the
first
alternative
in
the
hierarchy
is
the
price
charged
by
the
same
seller
for
a
similar
or
related
good
.
consistent
with
our
preliminary
determination
,
we
have
determined
that
we
cannot
use
the
first
alternative
benchmark
because
pequiven
does
not
sell
any
of
the
products
identified
on
the
record
as
being
similar
to
orthoxylene
(
(
ie
,
paraxylene
,
metaxylene
and
mixedxylene
mixed
xylene
.
the
second
alternative
listed
in
the
proposed
regulations
is
the
price
charged
within
the
jurisdiction
by
other
sellers
for
an
identical
good

pequiven
is
the
only
domestic
producer
seller
of
orthoxylene
in
venezuela
.
however
,
orthoxylene
was
imported
into
venezuela
during
the
poi

in
the
preliminary
determination
,
we
used
us

export
statistics
on
shipments
of
orthoxylene
to
venezuela
during
the
period
19921993
.
from
these
statistics
,
we
used
the
information
on
the
one
entry
that
occurred
during
the
poi
to
calculate
a
benchmark
price
,
since
this
was
`
a
price
charged
within
the
jurisdiction
by
other
sellers
for
an
identical
good
'
based
on
our
comparison
of
pequivens
price
for
orthoxylene
with
the
us
.
export
price
(
adjusted
for
freight
and
insurance
,
we
preliminarily
determined
that
the
pequivens
price
to
oxidor
was
nonpreferential
preferential
.
we
have
examined
this
transaction
carefully
for
purposes
of
our
final
determination
to
determine
whether
it
can
serve
as
a
proper
benchmark
for
sales
of
orthoxylene
by
pequiven
.
first
,
we
have
considered
the
quantity
involved
and
the
terms
of
sale
.
based
on
a
comparison
of
the
us
.
export
to
pequivens
monthly
sales
to
the
two
pa
producers
,
we
have
determined
that
this
sale
is
within
the
range
of
quantities
purchased
from
pequiven
each
month
and
,
therefore
,
involves
sufficiently
large
quantities
to
serve
as
an
appropriate
benchmark
.
second
,
with
respect
to
the
terms
of
sale
,
petitioners
argued
that
the
prices
reported
in
the
us
.
export
statistics
are
spot
prices
,
whereas
pequivens
prices
are
on
a
contract
basis
.
petitioners
stated
that
this
fact
should
preclude
the
department
from
using
the
us
.
export
data
as
a
benchmark
since
they
are
incomparable
to
pequivens
prices
.
respondents
countered
that
,
while
pequiven
did
have
a
contract
with
its
customers
,
the
terms
of
`
contract
'
and
`
spot
'
sales
are
different
in
venezuela
than
in
the
united
states
.
specifically
,
they
argued
that
contract
needs
and
obligations
of
secured
quantity
are
much
greater
in
the
us
.
than
in
venezuela
.
because
the
venezuelan
market
is
so
small
,
respondents
took
the
position
that
a
spot
price
is
a
more
appropriate
benchmark
.
both
parties
have
submitted
world
market
prices
for
orthoxylene
as
reported
by
the
industry
publications
of
several
private
reporting
agencies
to
support
their
arguments
.
based
on
the
information
provided
by
both
parties
,
we
determined
that
there
is
a
consistent
difference
between
contract
and
spot
prices
as
reported
by
the
private
reporting
agencies
.
given
that
the
degree
of
difference
is
consistent
throughout
the
poi
,
we
believe
it
is
possible
to
adjust
the
us
.
export
spot
price
to
make
it
comparable
to
a
contract
price
.
to
calculate
the
adjustment
,
we
averaged
the
difference
between
monthly
contract
and
spot
prices
as
reported
by
the
three
reporting
services
,
and
added
the
average
spread
for
04/19/1992
(
the
month
of
the
single
importation
)
to
the
us
.
export
price
.
in
addition
,
because
this
import
into
venezuela
was
reported
on
a
fas
basis
,
we
added
an
amount
for
ocean
freight
and
insurance
from
the
united
states
to
venezuela
.
the
amount
for
ocean
freight
and
insurance
was
obtained
from
an
independent
shipping
company
