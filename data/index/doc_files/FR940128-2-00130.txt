for

in
rural
areas
because
of
geographic
distances
,
low
population
density
and
,
in
some
cases
,
cultural
differences
,
it
is
difficult
to
provide
effective
services
to
runaway
and
homeless
youth
in
rural
areas
.
in
many
such
areas
,
scarcity
of
funds
and
other
resources
precludes
the
funding
of
separate
,
autonomous
basic
center
programs
.
there
is
a
need
for
innovative
and
effective
models
for
the
provision
of
runaway
and
homeless
youth
services
in
rural
areas
,
including
indian
reservations
.
these
models
would
make
services
accessible
to
youth
without
setting
up
inordinately
expensive
service
agencies
in
low
populated
areas
.
in
fy
1993
,
firstyear
first
year
funding
was
awarded
to
eight
grantees
to
develop
such
models
.
these
grants
are
expected
to
produce
written
descriptions
of
the
proposed
service
models
,
identify
issues
related
to
model
implementation
,
and
generate
information
on
youth
and
program

.
the
models
will
also
