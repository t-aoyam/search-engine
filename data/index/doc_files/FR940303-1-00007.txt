rather
,
the
proposed
regulations
attempt
to
reconcile
the
purposes
underlying
dr
7104
and
rule
42
with
effective
law
enforcement
.
recognizing
the
importance
of
the
attorneyclient
attorney
client
relationship
and
the
desirability
of
an
individual
who
is
represented
by
counsel
being
fully
advised
by
counsel
before
negotiating
legal
agreements
,
the
regulations
provide
that
federal
attorneys
may
not
negotiate
plea
bargains
,
settlement
agreements
,
immunity
agreements
or
similar
arrangements
without
the
participation
or
consent
of
the
individuals
attorney
.
in
this
context
,
the
prosecutors
superior
legal
training
and
specialized
knowledge
could
be
used
to
the
detriment
of
the
untutored
layperson
.
thus
,
the
regulations
comport
with
the
principal
purpose
of
dr
7104
and
rule
42
by
insisting
that
the
individuals
attorney
participate
in
these
types
of
negotiations
.
at
the
same
time
,
the
regulations
would
permit
direct
contacts
at
the
preindictment
,
prearrest
investigative
stage
with
any
individual
,
whether
or
not
he
or
she
is
represented
by
counsel
,
to
inquire
about
the
matters
under
investigation
.
the
regulations
are
drafted
to
conform
to
the
approach
of
most
federal
appellate
courts
that
have
considered
the
matter

the
department
believes
that
public
policy
and
effective
law
enforcement
would
not
be
served
if
one
could
exempt
himself
or
herself
from
lawful
,
courtsanctioned
court
sanctioned
investigative
techniques
simply
by
retaining
an
attorney
.
the
department
believes
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
alter
investigative
techniques
based
upon
an
individuals
financial
ability
to
retain
counsel
before
the
point
at
which
a
court
would
appoint
counsel
for
a
person
not
able
to
afford
counsel
.
the
regulations
and
the
accompanying
changes
to
the
united
states
attorneys
'
manual
also
would
give
effect
to
other
important
aspects
of
the
bar
rules
against
contacts
with
represented
parties
.
for
example
,
the
regulations
would
preclude
federal
attorneys
from
disparaging
an
individuals
counsel
or
from
attempting
to
gain
access
to
attorneyclient
attorney
client
confidences
or
lawful
defense
strategy
.
the
guidelines
contained
in
the
manual
provisions
will
also
make
clear
that
once
an
individual
is
in
a
likely
adversarial
situation
with
the
government
and
has
retained
an
attorney
to
represent
him
or
her
with
respect
to
the
particular
subject
matter
under
investigation
,
the
government
attorney
must
take
greater
care
before
making
any
ex
parte
contacts
.
while
the
proposed
regulations
authorize
most
communications
before
arrest
,
the
proposed
manual
changes
provide
that
,
as
a
matter
of
internal
policy
guidance
,
federal
prosecutors
generally
should
not
make
overt
contacts
with
represented
targets
of
investigations
.
however
,
the
manual
provisions
permit
overt
contacts
with
a
represented
target
when
initiated
by
the
target
;
when
necessary
to
prevent
death
or
physical
injury
;
when
the
relevant
investigation
involves
ongoing
,
additional
or
different
crimes
from
that
to
which
the
representation
relates
;
or
when
a
united
states
attorney
or
an
assistant
attorney
general
expressly
concludes
,
under
all
of
the
circumstances
,
that
the
contact
is
needed
for
effective
law
enforcement
.
finally
,
the
proposed
regulations
and
manual
provisions
also
address
when
a
government
attorney
may
communicate
with
an
employee
,
officer
or
director
of
a
represented
corporation
or
organization
without
the
consent
of
counsel
.
the
regulations
generally
prohibit
a
government
attorney
from
communicating
with
a
current
,
highlevel
high
level
employee
of
a
represented
organization
who
participates
as
a
`
decision
maker
in
the
determination
of
the
organizations
legal
position
in
the
proceeding
or
investigation
of
the
subject
matter
'
and
the
organization
has
been
named
as
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
or
civil
law
enforcement
proceeding
.
the
manual
provisions
further
generally
prohibit
contacts
with
controlling
individuals
of
organizations
that
have
not
yet
been
named
as
defendants
but
are
targets
of
federal
criminal
or
civil
law
enforcement
investigations
without
the
consent
of
counsel
.
the
proposed
regulations
recognize
that
state
courts
and
disciplinary
bodies
continue
to
play
the
primary
role
in
regulating
the
conduct
of
all
attorneys
,
including
those
who
work
for
the
federal
government
.
further
,
department
of
justice
attorneys
continue
to
be
subject
to
state
bar
ethical
rules
except
to
the
limited
extent
those
rules
conflict
with
lawful
federal
procedures
and
practices
.
as
noted
above
,
however
,
because
of
the
expanded
participation
of
federal
prosecutors
in
preindictment
investigations
,
dr
7104
and
model
rule
42
have
inevitably
affected
and
circumscribed
the
power
of
federal
law
enforcement
officials
to
carry
out
their
legally
mandated
responsibilities
.
state
courts
and
disciplinary
committees
are
not
the
appropriate
final
arbiters
of
the
scope
of
federal
policing
.
the
department
of
justice
must
assume
this
role
,
subject
to
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states
.
the
new
regulations
would
not
supplant
state
discipline
.
rather
,
the
regulations
would
provide
that
attorneys
who
comply
with
the
new
federal
rule
will
be
shielded
from
inconsistent
state
disciplinary
rules
.
on
the
other
hand
,
attorneys
who
willfully
violate
the
new
regulations
would
continue
to
be
subject
to
the
full
measure
of
state
disciplinary
jurisdiction
.
the
department
is
confident
that
,
taken
together
,
the
proposed
regulations
,
manual
amendments
and
this
supplemental
information
will
promote
the
public
interest
in
effective
law
enforcement
conforming
to
the
highest
standards
of
legal
ethics
.
