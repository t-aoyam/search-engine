tentatively
,
several
issues
of
concern
have
been
identified
through
the
scoping
process
.
these
issues
are
briefly
described

public
involvement
and
scoping
public
participation
to
this
point
has
been
extensive
.
on
08/15/1991
an
initial
scoping
meeting
was
held
with
the
local
community
and
interested
individuals
for
the
development
of
a
timber
sale
proposal
.
on
05/28/1992
we
held
another
open
house
to
present
a
revised
proposal
.
in
addition
,
a
field
trip
to
the
murphy
decision
area
was
conducted
on
06/26/1992
with
seven
individuals
attending
.
comments
were
requested
in
writing
during
all
of
these
public
involvement
efforts
.
consultation
with
appropriate
state
and
federal
agencies
has
been
initiated
.
preliminary
effects
analysis
indicated
that
the
proposed
action
may
significantly
affect
quality
of
the
human
environment
and
may
substantially
alter
the
undeveloped
character
of
the
marston
face
roadless
area
.
these
potential
effects
prompted
the
decision
to
prepare
an
eis
for
the
murphy
timber
sales
.
this
environmental
analysis
and
decision
making
process
will
unable
additional
interested
and
affected
people
to
participate
and
contribute
to
the
final
decision
.
public
participation
will
be
requested
at
several
points
during
the
analysis
.
the
forest
service
will
be
seeking
information
,
comments
,
and
assistance
from
federal
,
state
,
local
agencies
and
other
individuals
or
organizations
who
may
be
interested
in
or
affected
by
the
proposed
projects
.
this
input
will
be
used
in
preparation
of
the
draft
and
final
eis
.
the
scoping
process
will
include
:
&
bullidentifying
potential
issues
.
&
bullidentifying
major
issues
to
be
analyzed
in
depth
.
&
bullexploring
additional
alternatives
which
will
be
derived
from
issues
recognized
during
scoping
activities
.
&
bullidentifying
potential
environmental
effects
of
this
project
and
alternatives
(
ie
.
direct
,
indirect
,
and
cumulative
effects
and
connected
actions
.
the
analysis
will
consider
a
range
of
alternatives
,
including
the
proposed
action
,
no
action
,
and
other
reasonable
action
alternatives
.
estimated
dates
for

the

murphy
eis
is
expected
to
be
filed
with
the
environmental
protection
agency
(
epa
)
and
to
be
available
for
public
review
by
09/19/1994
.
at
that
time
epa
will
publish
a
notice
of
availability
of
the
draft
eis
in
the
federal
register
.
.
the
comment
period
on
the
draft
eis
will
be
45
days
from
the
date
the
epa
publishes
the
notice
of

the
final
eis
is
scheduled
to
be
completed
by
12/19/1994
.
in
the
final
eis
,
the
forest
service
is
required
to
respond
to
comments
and
responses
received
during
the
comment
period
that
pertain
to
the
environmental
consequences
discussed
in
the
draft
eis
and
applicable

,
regulations
,
and
policies
considered
in
making
a
decision
regarding
the
proposal
.
reviewers
obligations
the
forest
service
believes
,
at
this
early
stage
,
it
is
important
to
give
reviewers
notice
of
several
court
rulings
related
to
public
participation
in
the
environmental
review
process
.
first
,
reviewers
of
draft
environmental
impact
statements
must
structure
their
participation
in
the
environmental
review
of
the
proposal
so
that
it
is
meaningful
and
alerts
an
agency
to
the
reviewers
position
and
contentions

because
of
these
court
rulings
,
it
is
very
important
that
those
interested
in
this
proposed
action
participate
by
the
close
of
the
45
day
comment
period
so
that
substantive
comments
and
objections
are
made
available
to
the
forest
service
at
a
time
when
it
can
meaningfully
consider
and
respond
to
them
in
the
final
eis
.
to
be
most
helpful
,
comments
on
the
draft
eis
should
be
as
specific
as
possible
and
may
address
the
adequacy
of
the
statement
or
the
merit
of
the
alternatives
discussed
.

may
