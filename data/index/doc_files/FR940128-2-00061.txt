background
the
naval
nuclear
propulsion
program
is
a
joint
navy
department
of
energy
(
doe
)
organization
responsible
for
all
matters
pertaining
to
naval
nuclear
propulsion
.
the
program
is
responsible
for
the
nuclear
propulsion
plants
aboard
more
than
120
warships
powered
by
over
140
naval
reactors
;
two
moored
training
ships
used
for
naval
nuclear
propulsion
plant
operator
training
;
nuclear
work
performed
at
eight
shipyards
;
two
doe
governmentowned
government
owned
laboratories
devoted
solely
to
naval
nuclear
propulsion
research
,
development
,
and
design
;
and
eight
landbased
land
based
prototype
naval
reactors
used
for
research
and
development
work
and
training
of
naval
nuclear
propulsion
plant
operators
.
beginning
in
1957
,
spent
fuel
removed
from
nuclear
powered
ships
and
prototypes
has
been
sent
to
the
expended
core
facility
for
examination
to
evaluate
its
performance
and
confirm
design
and
operational
predictions
.
the
expended
core
facility
is
part
of
the
naval
reactors
facility
which
is
located
within
the
doe
idaho
national
engineering
laboratory
.
the
federal
government
has
been
involved
in
litigation
with
the
state
of
idaho
regarding
spent
nuclear
fuel
issues
at
the
idaho
national
engineering
laboratory
in
idaho
.
the
navy
became
involved
in
this
lawsuit
when
idaho
requested
an
injunction
in
1992
against
shipments
of
all
spent
fuel
,
including
naval
fuel
,
until
doe
completed
an
environmental
impact
statement
under
the
national
environmental
policy
act
evaluating
activities
involving
all
spent
nuclear
fuel
at
the
idaho
national
engineering
laboratory
.
on
06/28/1993
,
the
federal
district
court
in
idaho
granted
the
state
of
idahos
request
for
an
injunction
and
directed
doe
to
evaluate
`
the
direct
and
indirect
environmental
effects
of
all
major
federal
actions
involving
the
transportation
,
receipt
,
processing
,
and
storage
of
spent
nuclear
fuel
at
the
idaho
national
engineering
laboratory
'
furthermore
,
the
court
order
directed
doe
to
consider
the
alternative
of
`
transporting
,
receiving
,
processing
,
and
storing
spent
nuclear
fuel
at
sites
other
than
the
[
idaho
]
national
engineering
laboratory
'
the
doe
is
separately
preparing
an
environmental
impact
statement
on
spent
nuclear
fuel
management
throughout
the
doe
,
which
includes
naval
spent
fuel
.
the
navy
is
a
cooperating
agency
in
this
effort
.
the
doe
environmental
impact
statement
will
evaluate
alternatives
for
managing
naval
spent
fuel
from
1995
through
2035
,
and
will
consider
naval
shipyards
and
other
sites
for
this
purpose
.
a
previous
federal
register
announcement
provides
further
information

the
doe
environmental
impact
statement
is
scheduled
to
be
published
in
04/19/1995
with
a
record
of
decision
by
06/01/1995
.
preferred
alternative
if
no
action
were
taken
,
loaded
naval
spent
fuel
shipping
containers
would
accumulate
at
five
shipyards
:
portsmouth
naval
shipyard
in
kittery
,
maine
;
norfolk

shipyard
in
portsmouth
,
virginia
;

;
puget

in
bremerton
,
washington
;
and
pearl

naval
shipyard
in
pearl
harbor
,
hawaii
.
naval
spent
fuel
also
would
remain
in
the
surface
ship
support
barge
at
newport
news
shipbuilding
.
the
no
action
alternative
,
which
is
the
preferred
alternative
,
would
allow
all
shipyard
work
,
including
refueling
and
defueling
of
nuclear
powered
ships
,
to
continue
unimpeded
by
the
shortterm
short
term
accumulation
of
naval
spent
fuel
.
consolidation
alternative
under
the
consolidation
alternative
,
naval
spent
nuclear
fuel
in
shipping
containers
would
be
consolidated
at
norfolk
naval
shipyard
on
the
east
coast
and
at
puget
sound
naval
shipyard
for
the
pacific
ocean
shipyards
.
the
surface
ship
support
barge
would
remain
in
use
at
newport
news
shipbuilding
.
all
other
shipyard
work
,
including
refueling
and
defueling
of
nuclear
powered
ships
,
would
continue
unimpeded
under
the
consolidation
alternative
.
however
,
this
alternative
offers
no
operational
advantages
to
the
navy
compared
to
the
no
action
alternative
,
and
it
would
entail
otherwise
unnecessary
shipping
of
naval
spent
fuel
.
moored
ship
alternative
under
the
moored
ship
alternative
,
nuclear
powered
ship
inactivations
would
be
deferred
.
the
nuclear
propulsion
plants
would
be
taken
to
a
cold
shutdown
condition
and
physically
modified
to
prevent
reactor
operation
,
such
as
by
eliminating
the
capability
to
withdraw
control
rods
.
only
the
ship
systems
necessary
to
support
eventual
defueling
would
be
maintained
.
the
ship
would
be
tied
up
at
a
pier
within
the
controlled
industrial
area
of
the
shipyard
where
it
was
scheduled
to
be
defueled
.
reduced
crews
would
provide
surveillance
and
necessary
maintenance
of
the
ships
.
the
moored
ship
alternative
has
operational
disadvantages
compared
to
the
no
action
and
consolidation
alternatives
.
it
would
disrupt
shipyard
work
schedules
,
idle
skilled
shipyard
defueling
and
inactivation
workers
,
and
utilize
highly
trained
navy
nuclear
ship
operators
in
the
unproductive
task
of
watching
over
shut
down
ships
.
