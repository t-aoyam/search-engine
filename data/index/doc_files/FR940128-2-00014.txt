moreover
,
petitioners
claim
that
the
calculation
methodologies
used
to
prepare
kts
september
and
october
responses
were
virtually
identical
.
according
to
petitioners
,
for
both
the
september
and
october
responses
,
kt
calculated
its
material
costs
by
multiplying
the
average
perkilogram
per
kilogram
material
cost
by
the
nominal
weight
of
the
pipe
.
petitioners
assert
that
the
nominal
weights
used
for
these
calculations
were
identical
because
kt
stated
that
the
nominal
weight
of
the
pipe
was
determined
according
to
astm
a312
specifications
.
thus
,
petitioners
contend
that
differences
in
the
materials
costs
could
only
arise
if
kt
used
different
average
per
kilogram
materials
costs
for
its
september
and
october
responses
.
petitioners
maintain
that
these
per
kilogram
materials
costs
are
different
for
no
apparent
reason
and
are
therefore
suspect
.
petitioners
contend
that
kt
is
incorrect
in
its
assertion
that
the
difference
in
the
material
costs
reported
in
the
two
cost
responses
is
immaterial
to
whether
home
market
sales
were
made
at
prices
below
kts
cost
of
production
.
according
to
petitioners
,
kts
analysis
mistakenly
assumes
that
the
understatement
of
its
costs
can
be
corrected
by
merely
using
the
costs
in
kts
unverified
october
response
.
consequently
,
petitioners
argue
that
the
department
should
reject
both
of
kts
cost
responses
and
use
bia
to
establish
kts
final
dumping
margin
.
doc
position
:
we
agree
with
kt
.
the
department
verified
that
kt
accurately
reported
its
actual
material
expenses
incurred
during
the
poi
.
although
the
department
noted
at
verification
that
kt
did
not
break
out
material
costs
between
specific
dimensions
of
pipe
within
a
particular
grade
for
the
verified
submission
,
the
record
indicates
that
the
company
incurred
the
same
per
kilogram
cost
for
differing
gauges
of
coil
within
a
particular
grade
of
steel
.
we
find
that
a
comparison
of
the
methodologies
used
in
september
and
october
responses
is
irrelevant
because
we
only
verified
the
methodology
used
in
the
september
response
.
prior
to
verification
,
we
determined
that
the
costs
contained
in
the
october
submission
were
not
adequately
productspecific
product
specific
to
meet
the
departments
requirements
;
therefore
,
we
informed
kt
that
we
would
not
verify
the
com
portion
of
that
response
.
rather
,
the
department
verified
the
material
costs
used
in
the
september
submission
.
because
the
methodologies
used
to
compile
the
data
in
the
two
submissions
were
different
,
the
costs
reported
in
the
submissions
also
differed
.
therefore
,
the
fact
that
the
september
data
differed
from
the
october
data
does
not
provide
sufficient
grounds
to
reject
these
costs
.
because
we
verified
the
reasonableness
of
the
september
costs
,
we
have
accepted
them
for
purposes
of
the
final
determination
.
comment
3
:
petitioners
argue
that
the
department
should
reject
the
cost
of
production
data
contained
in
kts
original
cost
submission
because
the
department
was
unable
to
verify
the
reported
fabrication
costs
.
specifically
:
(
1
)
the
fabrication
costs
reported
by
kt
in
its
09/13/1993
,
submission
were
allocated
to
cost
centers
based
on
budgeted
usage
rates
which
could
not
be
reconciled
to
kts
actual
poi
experience
;
(

)
kts
methodology
of
allocating
fabrication
costs
between
industrial
and
ornamental
pipe
yields
a
result
which
is
inconsistent
with
its
reported
production
process
steps
;
and
(

)
total
manufacturing
costs
for
industrial
pipe
were
allocated
to
each
subject
product
based
on
the
weight
of
production
rather
than
machine
time
.
petitioners
note
that
,
to
the
extent
the
department
resorted
to
weightbased
weight
based
allocations
in
a
previous
case
involving
wssp
(
see
,
final
determination
of
sales
at
less
than
fair
value
:
certain
welded
stainless
steel
pipe
from
taiwan
(

fr

,
11/12/1992
)
(
wssp
from
taiwan
,
that
case
represents
an
aberration
from
the
departments
usual
practice
and
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
the
facts
in
the
present
case
.
petitioners
maintain
that
in
wssp
from
taiwan
the
department
accepted
the
taiwanese
respondents
allocation
because
it
concluded
that
the
allocation
`
did
not
materially
affect
the
cost
calculation
because
labor
and
overhead
represented
a
small
part
of
total
cost
of
production
'
in
this
case
,
however
,
petitioners
contend
that
kts
submitted
data
demonstrate
that
fabrication
costs
can
hardly
be
considered
immaterial
in
relation
to
the
submitted
total
cost
of
production
.
thus
,
petitioners
contend
that
kts
reliance
on
wssp
from
taiwan
as
a
basis
for
claiming
that
weightbased
weight
based
allocations
are
acceptable
is
misplaced
.
alternatively
,
petitioners
assert
that
the
department
accepts
allocation
methodologies
based
on
weight
only
when
a
respondent
affirmatively
shows
that
such
allocations
make
sense
in
light
of
the
specific
fabrication
process
for
the
product
under
investigation
and
when
allocations
based
on
machine
time
cannot
be
performed
.
according
to
petitioners
,
neither
criterion
has
been
satisfied
by
kt
,
and
thus
the
department
should
reject
kts
weightbased
weight
based
allocations
in
favor
of
bia
.
