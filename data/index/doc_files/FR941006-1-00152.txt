as
previously
discussed
in

document
,
some
evidence
suggests
that
carbonyl
iron
,
an
elemental
iron
powder
,
seems
to
be
effective
in
the
prevention
or
treatment
of
iron
deficiency
,
and
that
it
might
be
significantly
less
toxic
than
other

commonly
used
in

the
agency
requested
data
on
the
acute
toxicity
in
humans
,
and
particularly
in
children
,
of
elemental
iron
.
fda
stated
that
,
if
information
is
received
that
is
persuasive
that
the
use
of
elemental
iron
will
substantially
decrease
the
risk
of
pediatric
poisoning
while
allowing
for
effective
dietary
iron
supplementation
,
it
will
consider
exempting
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
that
incorporate
reduced
iron
from
any
regulations
that
result
from
this
rulemaking
.
fda
does
not
have
any
information
regarding
the
availability
of
such
forms
of
iron
for
use
in
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
nor
does
fda
possess
any
information
that
would
allow
it
to
determine
how
many
products
would
be
reformulated
with
less
toxic
forms
of
iron
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
such
an
exemption
.
fda
requests

the
economic
impact

campaign
two
of
the
three
petitions
that
fda
received
advocated
educational
efforts
for
the
public
and
health
professionals
.
fda
agrees
that
the
public
needs
to
be
informed
of
the
dangers
of
pediatric
iron
poisoning
.
the
fact
that
in
7
years
over
2000
poisonings
have
occurred
that
have
required
some
kind
of
treatment
indicates
that
the

serious
harm

death
in
