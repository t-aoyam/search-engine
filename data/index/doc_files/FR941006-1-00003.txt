because
this
proposed
rule
would
provide
an
alternative
,
the
economic
impact
to
horse
owners
would
be
minimal
.
the
horse
owners
that
would
be
affected
by
this
rule
change
are
those
that
have
horses
which
test
positive
for
eia
and
voluntarily
choose
to
transport
their
horses
interstate
to
slaughter

an

aphis
estimates
that
,
annually
,
between
500
and
1000
horse
operations
have
horses
that
become
infected
with
eia
.
although
it
is
not
known
how
many
of
these
operations
are
`

'
entities
(
less

in

,
according
to

size
criteria
,
it
is
likely
that
most
are
in
that
category
.
current
estimates
put
the
number
of
horses
in
the
united
states
between
6
and
10
million

in

about
1

1859
(
about

tested
positive
for

under
these
circumstances
,
the
administrator
of

inspection
service
has
determined
that
this
action
would
not
