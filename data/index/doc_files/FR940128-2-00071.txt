supplementary
information
:
this
is
a
floodplain
statement
of
findings
for
the
proposed
installation
of
bedrock
and
unconsolidated
monitoring
wells
on
the
oak
ridge
k25
site
,
prepared
in
accordance
with
10
cfr
part
1022
.
a
notice
of
floodplain
involvement
was
published
in
the
federal
register
on
10/04/1993
,
and
a
floodplain
assessment
was
prepared
.
to
facilitate
future
remedial
actions
at
the
k25
site
under
the
comprehensive
environmental
response
,
compensation
,
and
liability
act
(
cercla
,
doe
is
proposing
to
drill
four
borings
.
two
borings
would
be
into
bedrock
to
depths
ranging
from
approximately
30
to
150
feet
,
and
the
two
other
borings
would
be
in
the
unconsolidated
sediments
overlying
the
bedrock
to
depths
from
approximately
15
to
50
feet
.
two
locations
would
be
involved
,
with
one
bedrock
and
one
unconsolidated
monitoring
well
at
each
location
.
each
borehole
would
be
converted
to
a
monitoring
well
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
hydrologic
and
water
quality
data
.
the
wells
are
proposed
to
be
located
in
the
floodplain
because
the
sites
were
selected
to
intersect
and
monitor
subsurface
flow
paths
near
poplar
creek
.
alternatives
to
the
proposed
action
included
(
1
)
no
action
,
and
(
2
)
alternate
sites
.
the
no
action
alternative
would
result
in
doe
being
unable
to
accurately
measure
possible
contaminant
releases
to
the
local
environment
.
alternate
sites
away
from
poplar
creek
(
outside
of
the
floodplain
)
could
not
adequately
monitor
subsurface
flow
paths
.
the
proposed
action
is
necessary
to
enable
doe
to
pursue
future
remedial
actions
and
meet
the
requirements
of
cercla
.
the
assessment
reveals
that
the
installation
of
monitoring
wells
at
the
k25
site
would
have
no
adverse
impact
on
the
100year
year
floodplain
of
poplar
creek
,
nor
alter
the
existing
normal
channel
cross
section
or
storage
capacity
of
poplar
creek
.
no
measures
are
needed
to
minimize
potential
harm
to
or
within
the
affected
floodplain
.
the
proposed
action
would
conform
to
applicable
state
or
local
floodplain
protection
standards
.
doe
will
endeavor
to
allow
15
days
of
public
review
after
publication
of
the
statement
of
findings
prior
to
implementing
the
proposed
action
.
