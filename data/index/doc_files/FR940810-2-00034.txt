supplementary
information
:
the
pending
award
is
based
on
an
unsolicited
application
for
the
project
entitled
`
enhancement
of
methane
conversion
using
electric
fields
.
the
overall
objective
of
this
project
is
to
develop
a
novel
,
economical
process
for
the
conversion
of
natural
gas
to
more
valuable
products
such
as
methanol
,
ethylene
,
and
other
organic
oxygenates
or
higher
hydrocarbons
.
specifically
,
the
university
of
oklahoma
will
investigate
and
develop
electric
field
conversion
and
electric
fieldenhanced
field
enhanced
catalytic
conversion
of
methane
,
resulting
in
an
economical
process
or
processes
for
the
direct
conversion
of
natural
gas
to
more
valuable
products
.
the
most
promising
process
configurations
and
the
most
promising
operating
conditions
will
be
identified
and
the
economic
viability
of
the
processes
evaluated
.
the
overall
scientific
or
technical
merits
of
the
new
technology
from
these
research
efforts
in
methane
conversion
are
primarily
in
the
areas
of
transportation
and
chemical
feedstocks
.
much
of
the
natural
gas
occurs
in
remote
areas
in
alaska
,
and
offshore
reservoirs
.
because
of
this
remoteness
,
the
cost
of
transporting
this
gas
to
markets
may
eventually
prohibit
the
utilization
of
these
resources
.
therefore
,
considerable
interest
is
being
shown
in
developing
a
relatively
simple
,
cost
effective
,
process
suitable
for
installation
at
the
wellhead
well
head
for
conversion
of
methane
to
transportable
liquid
.
technically
this
would
provide
new
market
areas
for
natural
gas
and
would
provide
the
means
for
transporting
costly
natural
gas
to
market
at
acceptable
costs
.
if
these
techniques
were
developed
it
could
be
used
to
offset
imported
oil
to
this
country
and
would
provide
new
transportation
fuels
,
energy
fuels
and
chemical
feedstocks
to
the
marketplace
