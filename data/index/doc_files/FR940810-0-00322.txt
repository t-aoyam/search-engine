do

analysis
the
analysis
of
asbestos
samples
can
be
divided
into
two
major
parts
:
sample
preparation
and
microscopy
.
because
of
the
different
asbestos
uses
that
may
be
encountered
by
the
analyst
,
each
sample
may
need
different
preparation
steps
.
the
choices
are
outlined
below
.
there
are
several
different
tests
that
are
performed
to
identify
the
asbestos
species
and
determine
the
percentage
.
they
will
