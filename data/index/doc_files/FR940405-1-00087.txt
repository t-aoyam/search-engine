indoor
air
contaminants
emanate
from
a
broad
array
of
sources
that
can
originate
both
outside
of
structures
as
well
as
from
within
a
building
.
when
a
building
is
new
,
some
contaminants
are
given
off
quickly
and
soon
disappear
.
others
continue
offgassing
off
gassing
at
a
slow
pace
for
years
.
common
office
supplies
and
equipment
have
been
found
to
release
hazardous
chemicalsespecially
duplicators
and
copiers
.
bulk
paper
stores
have
been
found
to
release
formaldehyde

some

dusts

household
dust

:

tobacco
smoke

microbes
:
_
bacteria
_

_
viruses
people
contribute
millions
of
particles
to
the
indoor
air
primarily
through
the
shedding
of
skin
scales
.
many
of
these
scales
carry
microbes
,
most
of
which
are
short
lived
and
harmless
.
clothing
,
furnishings
,
draperies
,
carpets
,
etc
.
contribute
fibers
and
other
fragments
.
cleaning
processes
,
sweeping
,
vacuuming
,
dusting
normally
remove
the
larger
particles
,
but
often
increase
the
airborne
concentrations
of
the
smaller
particles
.
cooking
,
broiling
,
grilling
,
gas
and
oil
burning
,
smoking
,
coal
and
wood
generate
vast
numbers
of
airborne
indoor
pollutants
in
various
classifications
.

controlling
indoor
air
control
of
pollutants
at
the
source
is
the
most
effective
strategy
for
maintaining
clean
indoor
air
.
however
,
control
or
mitigation
of
all
sources
is
not
always
possible
or
practical
.
in
the
case
of
ets
,
this
means
restricting
smoking
to
separately
ventilated
spaces
.
general
ventilation
is
,
therefore
,
the
second
most
effective
approach
to
providing
acceptable
indoor
air
