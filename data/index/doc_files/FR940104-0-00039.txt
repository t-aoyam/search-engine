in
1992
,
the
cdfg
estimated
that
the
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
run
size
increased
to
1180
fish
.
this
run
size
was
substantially
higher
than
the
runs
estimated
in
1989
(
547
fish
,
1990
(
441
fish
,
and
1991
(
191
fish
,
and
it
represented
more
than
a
100
percent
increase
in
the
spawning
population
in
a
single
successive
generation
since
the
1992
run
was
comprised
primarily
of
the
surviving
progeny
from
the
1989
run
.
in
1989
,
the
bureau
implemented
conservation
measures
to
manage
upper
sacramento
river
water
temperatures
and
provide
improved
fish
passage
at
the
red
bluff
.
as
a
result
of
these
actions
,
temperature
conditions
were
much
improved
with
favorable
water
temperatures
occurring
from
keswick
dam
to
bend
bridge
(
44
miles
downstream
)
during
almost
the
entire
spawning
and
egg
incubation
period
.
spawning
ground
surveys
in
1989
also
indicated
that
nearly
100
percent
of
the
estimated
run
spawned
in
this
44mile
mile
river
reach
where
water
temperature
was
favorable
.
as
a
result
of
these
factors
,
temperaturerelated
temperature
related
mortality
was
minimal
in
1989
.
the
substantial
increase
in
the
1992
run
size
suggests
that
the
measures
implemented
to
protect
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
in
1989
were
effective
,
and
that
similar
or
more
protective
measures
may
be
successful
in
the
future
.
in
1993
,
the
cdfg
estimated
the
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
run
size
to
be
341
fish
.
this
represented
nearly
a
30
percent
decline
of
the
run
size
in
one
generation
.
nmfs
had
anticipated
that
the
run
size
would
likely
decline
in
1993
because
the
1990
spawning
population
(
441
fish
)
experienced
less
favorable
water
temperature
conditions
during
spawning
and
egg
incubation
,
and
more
of
the
run
spawned
downstream
from
the
river
reach
where
temperatures
could
be
suitably
managed
by
the
bureau
.
in
1990
,
as
a
result
of
continued
drought
conditions
and
high
ambient
temperatures
,
favorable
water
temperatures
for
spawning
and
egg
incubation
were
present
only
from
keswick
dam
to
the
balls
ferry
bridge
(
26
miles
downstream
)
during
a
portion
of
the
egg
incubation
period
.
in
addition
,
spawning
distribution
surveys
indicated
that
nearly
10
percent
of
the
run
spawned
downstream
from
balls
ferry
where
temperatures
were
not
favorable
.
therefore
,
temperaturerelated
temperature
related
mortality
was
substantially
higher
in
1990
than
in
1989
.
in
addition
to
less
favorable
temperature
conditions
,
it
is
possible
that
conditions
for
outmigrants
were
less
than
favorable
,
and
that
ocean
survival
of
the
1990
year
class
was
reduced
by
the
el
nino
event
that
began
in
199192
.
since
the
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
was
formally
listed
as
threatened
in
11/19/1990
(
55
fr
46515
,
the
species
run
size
has
continued
to
decline
,
with
the
exception
of
1992
,
and
exhibit
considerable
variability
(
table

.
although
some
protective
measures
were
implemented
beginning
in
1987
,
this
decline
was
exacerbated
by
the
6year
year
drought
in
california
(
19871992
.
based
on
the
run
size
estimates
for
the
last
3
years
(
19911993
,
the
population
now
has
two
weak
year
classes
(
1991
and
1993
.
nmfs
expects
that
the
1994
run
will
also
be
weak
because
of
the
weak
1991
year
class
(
191
fish
)
and
the
less
than
favorable
conditions
for
spawning
,
egg
incubation
,
and
juvenile
outmigration
that
occurred
in
199192
.
because
of
the
small
run
in
1991
and
the
weak
return
expected
in
1994
,
this
year
class
is
likely
to
remain
weakened
for
some
time
.
as
part
of
the
status
review
,
extinction
probabilities
were
estimated
for
the
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
population
using
modifications
of
the
model
described
by
dennis
,
munholland
,
and
scott
(
1991
,
and
the
3year
year
geometric
moving
average
of
the
annual
estimated
run
size
for
the
periods
of
19671993
and
1979
1993
,
respectively
.
results
of
the
analysis
indicate
that
if
past
trends
continue
,
the
population
faces
a
high
probability
of
dropping
below
100
spawners
per
year
at
least
once
over
the
next
10
years
,
and
to
even
lower
levels
over
the
50
and
100
year
time
horizons
.
the
extinction
modeling
results
suggest
that
the
risk
of
the
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
population
dropping
to
unacceptably
low
levels
is
high
.
however
,
this
type
of
analysis
is
based
only
on
historical
trends
in
the
population
(
19671993
)
and
assumes
that
past
conditions
will
continue
in
the
future
.
although
the
1994
run
is
expected
to
be
weak
,
nmfs
believes
that
conditions
for
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
were
substantially
improved
in
1992
and
1993
because
of
longterm
long
term
protective
measures
implemented
to
reduce
impacts
of
central
valley
and
state
water
project
operations
and
improve
conditions
for
successful
egg
incubation
,
rearing
,
and
outmigration
,
and
the
end
of
the
drought
.
in
addition
to
these
protective
measures
,
the
fws
has
been
supplementing
the
natural
production
of
juveniles
with
substantial
numbers
of
hatchery
produced
fish
.
if
these
protective
measures
and
supplementation
efforts
prove
to
be
effective
,
run
sizes
in
1995
and
1996
will
likely
increase
.
for
these
reasons
,
the
probability
of
the
population
declining
to
low
levels
is
probably
less
than
suggested
by
the
extinction
modeling
analysis
.
however
,
because
the
effectiveness
of
these
recently
implemented
protective
measures
and
supplementation
efforts
is
unknown
and
cannot
be
assessed
until
future
runs
return
,
there
remains
substantial
risk
that
the
population
is
in
danger
of
extinction
.
summary
of
comments
the
world
wildlife
fund
supported
the
reclassification
and
also
encouraged
nmfs
to
develop
and
implement
a
recovery
plan
for
the
conservation
of
sacramento
river
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
the
department
of
the
interior
(
interior
)
also
supported
the
reclassification
of
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
,
and
said
the
population
remained
at
depressed
levels
and
may
be
in
danger
of
extinction
after
the
next
two
runs
.
however
,
interior
noted
that
the
1989
year
class
survived
particularly
well
and
that
the
resulting
1992
run
size
of
1180
adults
represented
more
than
a
100
percent
increase
in
size
in
a
single
successive
generation
.
interior
also
acknowledged
that
the
1992
increase
in
run
size
may
indicate
that
measures
taken
to
protect
the
population
in
recent
years
may
be
effective
.
interior
also
provided
technical
comments
to
clarify
and
update
facts
contained
in
the
proposed
rule
.
the
westlands
water
district
,
the
family
water
alliance
,
and
the
glenn
county
board
of
supervisors
all
opposed
reclassifying
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
because
of
protective
measures
that
have
been
recently
implemented
.
they
said
that
the
threatened
status
should
be
retained
until
the
effectiveness
of
these
measures
has
been
assessed
.
