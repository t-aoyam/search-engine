position
:
we
agree
with
petitioners
.
as
stated
in
our
preliminary
determination
,
it
is
the
departments
practice
to
calculate
credit
expenses
using
the
period
between
shipment
of
the
merchandise
from
the
factory
and
payment
.

comment

:
petitioners
argue
that
the
department
should
not
make
a
difference
in
merchandise
(
difmer
)
adjustment
in
any
instance
where
such
an
adjustment
would
lower
kts
fmv
.
petitioners
base
their
argument
on
the
fact
that
the
difmer
adjustments
are
based
on
kts
cost
data
which
petitioners
claim
is
unreliable
.
respondent
maintains
that
the
department
should
make
difmer
adjustments
in
cases
where
sales
of
nonidentical
identical
merchandise
are
compared
.
doc

agree
with
respondent
.
because
the
department
has
relied
on
kts
cop
data

we
have
used
this

make
