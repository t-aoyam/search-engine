william
dundulis

felt
that
to
avoid
confusion
,
osha
should
adopt
the
same
cutoff
that

used

its
worker
protection
rule3
linear
and
3

others
suggested
that
the
amount
of
material
be
defined
by
the
amount
of
asbestoscontaining
asbestos

waste
generated
by
the
activity
.
for
example
,
preston
quirk
of
gobbell

suggested
cutoff
maximum
of
55
gallon
drum
or
1
cubic

while
osha
witness

3

10
linear

the
cutoff

noting
that
the
amount
of
material
covering
a
pipe
varies
with
its
diameter
,
(
and
the
thickness
of
the
material
)
bctd
calculated
that
removal

vary
from

cubic

although
osha
believes
that
the
amount
of
waste
material
generated
by
a
job
may
be
a
valid
index
of
its
exposure
potential
,
the
agency
agrees
with
participants
who
pointed
out
the
difficulties

estimating
the
