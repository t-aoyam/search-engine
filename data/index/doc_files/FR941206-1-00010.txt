tentative
consideration
in
the
03/19/1994
anpr
was
to
define
and
standardize
certain
mechanically
separated
poultry
by
concentrating
on
the
product
characteristics
that
the
agency
believes
distinguishes
this
product
from
poultry
produced
by
traditional
deboning
methods
,
ie
,
handdeboning
hand
deboning
.
a
different
way
of
defining
and
standardizing
this
product
based
on
starting
materials
was
suggested
by
one
commenter
.
it
was
suggested
that
a
certain
type
of
statistical
analysis
(
factorial
analysis
)
be
performed
in
order
to
identify
a
relationship
between
percent
bone
solids
content
and
types
of
starting
materials
used
to
manufacture
mechanically
separated
poultry
.
by
suggesting
this
type
of
statistical
analysis
,
the
commenter
supported
a
procedure
for
establishing
a
standard
that
would
account
for
the
materials
used
,
and
percent
bone
solids
content
limits
would
vary
by
the
processing
procedure
employed
by
the
processor
.
however
,
it
was
never
the
intention
of
the
03/19/1994
anpr
to
suggest
possibly
defining
and
standardizing
mechanically
separated
poultry
by
starting
materials
used
.
the
data
collected
by
fsis
in
1993
and
used
in
the
report
previously
cited
,
came
from
industry
records
.
information
was
collected
on
starting
materials
but
not
on
the
percentages
of
use
nor
on
processing
parameters
,
eg
,
pressures
,
settings
,
used
during
processing
.
thus
,
data
could
not
be
used
for
establishing
process
control
parameters
or
for
determining
the
relationship
between
bone
solids
content
and
other
product
characteristics
,
the
materials
used
,
and
processing
parameters
employed
by
establishments
in
the
study
.
the
purpose
of
collecting
the
data
was
to
examine
the
levels
of
bone
solids
in
mechanically
separated
poultry
produced
today
,
and
to
get
an
idea
of
the
variability
of
the
percentage
of
bone
solids
contents
within
an
establishment
.
information
on
starting
materials
was
collected
to
ensure
that
the
sample
of
establishments
represented
the
different
types
of
materials
used
to
manufacture
mechanically
separated
poultry
.
if
in
establishing
standards
for
the
product
,
the
agency
had
intended
to
use
explicit
starting
materials
to
manufacture
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
,
then
more
data
would
need
to
be
collected
under
known
or
controlled
conditions
.
fsis
believes
that
any
standard
established
for
mechanically
separated
poultry
should
not
preclude
a
manufacturer
from
using
any
type
of
starting
materials
so
long
as
the
requirements
of
the
standard
are
satisfied
.
further
,
in
response
to
comments
about
the
application
of
an
acceptable
tolerance
for
meeting
bone
solids
content
criteria
based
on
statistical
variation
,
fsis
agrees
that
the
establishment
of
such
a
tolerance
should
be
considered
.
however
,
because
this
issue
requires
indepth
technical
review
,
fsis
will
consider
it
for
possible
rulemaking
in
the
future
.
b
.
handling
requirements
.
the
tentative
position
presented
in
the
03/19/1994
anpr
indicated
that
fsis
was
tentatively
considering
that
starting
material
to
be
processed
into
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
be
processed
into
this
product
within
2
hours
from
the
time
it
is
separated
from
the
bones
of
poultry
carcasses
or
parts
of
carcasses
,
except
that
such
product
may
be
held
for
no
more
than
72
hours
at
40

or

additionally
,
the
anpr
indicated
that
fsis
was
considering
proposing
that
mechanically
separated
poultry
be
chilled
to
40

cir
;
f

or

,
or

.
furthermore
,
it
was
indicated
that
fsis
was
considering
proposing
that
such
product
be
used
as
an
ingredient
in
a
poultry
or
meat
food
product
directly
after
being
processed
,
except
that
it
might
be
held
prior

twentyseven
twenty
seven
commenters
addressed
the
issue
of
handling
requirements
for
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
.
all
of
the
commenters
disagreed
with
the
need
for
handling
requirements
and
,
specifically
,
the
need
for
a
time
constraint
by
which
the
raw
material
used
to
manufacture
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
has
to
be
processed
into
such
product
.
commenters
stated
that
chicken
can
be
held
for
varying
times
and
still
be
safe
depending
on
manufacturing
practices
,
and
that
the
raw
materials
used
need
to
be
organoleptically
evaluated
and
not
set
up
on
a
time
schedule
,
ie
,
processed
within
72
hours
.
the
commenters
also
stated
that
there
are
already
adequate
regulations
on
handling
and
storage
,
and
any
additional
handling
requirements
should
be
handled
in
a
more
inclusive
way
,
eg
,
as
part
of
a
hazard
analysis
critical
control
point
(
haccp
)
effort
.
fsis
believes
that
handling
requirements
are
necessary
to
produce
a
safe
and
wholesome
product
,
and
that
potential
bacterial
hazards
are
diminished
as
long
as
handling
accords
with
good
manufacturing
practices
.
fsis
believes
that
it
is
the
manufacturers
responsibility
,
in
concert
with
fsis
,
to
assure
that
wholesome
materials
are
used
in
the
manufacture
of
its
product
within
sound
timeframes
,
and
the
safety
of
such
product
is
not
negatively
affected
.
