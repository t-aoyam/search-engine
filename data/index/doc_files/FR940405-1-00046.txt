studies
of
ets

chronic

in
adults
differ
by
how
they
define
`
never
smokers

`
exsmokers

and
how
other
various
levels
of
ets
exposure
are
defined

in

scales
;
and
whether

they
take

in

the

for

occurs
when

are
loosely
defined

the

the

was
quantified

in

in
those

had

had
specified
a

10

,
significant

overall
,
changes
in
pulmonary
indices
are
more
likely
to
occur
in
men
than
in
women
,
however
,
several
studies
have
documented
statistically
significant
physiological
changes

occurring
in
women

understanding
the
significance
of
findings
is
complicated
because
studies
used
a
variety
of
measures
from
spirometry
.
although
most
studies
evaluated
fvc
(
forced
vital
capacity
)
and
fev
(
forced
expiratory
volume
in
one
second
,
fewer
studies
have
measured
fef
2575
or
fef
7585
[
exs
.
4176
,
4180
,
4209
,
4210
,
4321
.
these
later
measures
have
been
suggested
as
being
more
sensitive
to
detecting
changes
in
the
small
airways
where
effects
of
ets
are
most
likely
to
occur
[
exs
.
446
,
4216
,
4230
,
4231
.
however
,
there
is
no
clear
consensus
in
the
medical
literature
as
to
the
routine
clinical
use
of
fef
2575
or
fef
7585
,
or
their
diagnostic
value
in
independently
detecting
small
airway
disease
[

.
estimates
of
the
decrement
in
fev
due
to
ets
exposure
in
passive
smokers
as
compared
to
never
smokers
,
ranges
from
80
milliliters
(
ml
)
[
ex

4148
]
to
190
ml
[
ex
.
437
.
when
this
decrement
is
expressed
as
a
percent
of
fev
,
,
it
has
been
estimated
to
be
57
%
in
males
,
or
73
%
when
these
same
subjects
were
matched
for
age
[
ex

as
a
means
of
comparison
,
the
average
loss
in
lung
volume
per
year
due
to
aging
alone
is
estimated
to
be
25
to
30
ml
[
ex

4329
.
the
american
thoracic
society
[
ex
.
48
]
specifies
that
spirometry
equipment
have
a
level
of
accuracy
within
50
ml
.
since
pulmonary
function
maneuvers
are
very
effort
dependent
,
intraindividual
individual
variation
between
the
three
best
efforts
should
be
within
5
%
to
be
acceptable
.
the
importance
of
these
spirometry
criteria
is
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
the
fev
may
result
in
being
100
to
200
ml
lower
than
when
a
maximal
effort
is
given
by
the
subject
.
furthermore
,
a
decrease
of
15
%
must
be
achieved
before
certain
pulmonary
indices
are
considered
outside
of
normal
limits
.
given
this
perspective
,
although
changes
in
pulmonary
function
tests
may
truly
occur
as
a
result
of
exposure
to
ets
over
a
number
of
years
,
the
actual
clinical
impact
may
not
be
apparent
in
the
healthy

young

older
individuals

preexisting
pulmonary
disease

more
susceptible

these

the

at
which

cellular
effects
on
the
pulmonary
tissue
have
also
been
observed
in
animals
exposed
to
ets
during
experimental
studies
.
several
studies

demonstrated
that

in
