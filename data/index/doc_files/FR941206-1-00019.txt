content
of
msk

from

and
msk

from
all

not

significantly
.
fsis
believes
that
the
data
reported
in
the
1979
health
and
safety
report
are
currently
the
best
available
on
this
subject
and
the
conclusions
reached
are
valid
.
however
,
fsis
is
aware
that
the
benefits
of
fluoride
in
the
diet
continues
to
be
studied
by
the
scientific
community
and
that
more
information
is
available
today
on
the
subject
than
in
1979
when
the
agency
published
the
health
and
safety
report
.
the
1993
national
academy
of
sciences
'
subcommittee
on
health
effects
of
ingested
fluoride
report
titled
,
`
health
effects
of
ingested
fluoride
'
(
nas
fluoride
report
,
commissioned
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
(
epa
)
provides
current
information
on
the
complexities
of
assessing
effects
of
fluoride
in
the
diet
and
makes
recommendations
for
further
research
.
the
nas
fluoride
report
cites
dental
products
containing
fluoride
(
topical
fluoride
applications
by
dentists
,
fluoride
supplementation
,
and
ingestion
of
fluoride
dentifrices
,
beverages
made
with
water
containing
fluoride
(
tea
and
coffee
,
as
well
as
manufactured
drinks
,
and
foods
as
being
the
major
sources
of
ingested
fluoride
.
the
nas
fluoride
report
points
out
that
,
while
ingestion
of
fluoride
from
some
sources
may
have
gone
up
,
some
food
sources
of
fluoride
have
gone
down
.
for
example
,
ingestion
of
fluoride
from
infant
formulas
(
a
source
of
dietary
fluoride
considered
in
the
1979
health
and
safety
report
)
has
gone
down
because
of
the
agreement
among
the
producers
of
infant
formulas
to
use
only
water
low
in
fluoride
for
all
their
products
.
the
changing
sources
of
fluoride
ingestion
makes
assessing
intakes
and
effects
on
populations
inherently
difficult
.
in
the
modern
us
.
environment
,
people
are
exposed
to
fluoride
from
food
,
beverages
,
toothpaste
,
and
a
variety
of
prescribed
or
overthecounter
the
counter
dental
products
.

while
the
nas
fluoride
report
reiterates
the
positive
effects
of
increased
fluoride
intake
on
reduction
of
dental
caries
in
the
1990s
as
compared
to
the
1950s
,
it
also
cites
the
side
effect
of
dental
fluorosis
,
eg
,
too
much
fluoride
ingested
in
early
childhood
while
teeth
are
forming
.
dental
fluorosis
occurs
when
the
enamel
covering
of
the
teeth
fails
to
crystallize
properly
,
leading
to
defects
that
range
from
barely
discernible
to
severe
brown
stain
,
surface
pitting
,
and
brittleness
.
the
report
states
that
`
the
most
effective
approach
to
controlling
the
prevalence
of
severity
of
dental
fluorosis
,
without
jeopardizing
the
benefits
of
fluoride
to
oral
health
,
is
likely
to
come
from
more
judicious
control
of
fluoride
in
foods
,
processed
beverages
,
and
dental
products
,
especially
those
items
used
by
young
children
'
fsis
agrees
with
this
conclusion
and
maintains
its
concern
for
the
potential
effect
of
fluorosis
in
the
susceptible
population
of
babies
,
infants
,
and
toddlers
.
therefore
,
fsis
believes
that
the
tentative
position
set
forth
in
its
03/19/1994
anpr
previously
discussed
,
to
restrict
the
use
of
msk
)
made
from
fowl
in
baby
(
ie
,
strained
,
junior
,
and
toddler
foods
is
prudent
.
however
,
fsis
is
requesting
that
commenters
provide
to
the
agency
any
information
that
would
either
reaffirm
or
contradict
the
conclusions
reached
in
the
1979
health
and
safety
report
.
fsis
intends
to
reassess
and
update
the
1979
health
and
safety
report
regarding
fluoride
in
light
of
information
submitted
in
response
to
this

poultry
product
limitations
.
fsis
believes
that
the
use
of

)
should
be
limited
in
certain
poultry
products
.
fsis
is
proposing
that
msk

not

allowed
in
poultry
products
that
are
composed
of
whole
poultry
muscle
,
and
expected
to
be
as
such
by
consumers
,
except
that
it
may
be
used
for
binding
purposes
at
a
level
that
is
sufficient
for
purpose
.
however
,
fsis
will
allow
msk
)
in
the
sauce
portion
or
any
dressing
of
poultry
products
.
msk
)
is
a
highly
comminuted
ingredient
with
a
spreadlike
spread
like
consistency
and
fsis
considers
its
use
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
basic
characteristics
associated
with
poultry
products
that
have
been
processed
only
to
the
extent
of
cutting
or
grinding
or
that
are
made
from
poultry
products
so
processed
,
such
as
chicken
breasts
,
turkey
fillets
,
and
shredded
chicken
.
fsis
also
considers
their
use
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
basic
characteristics
associated
with
poultry
products
that
are
processed
,
convenience
versions
of
readytocook
ready
to

,
such
as
roasted

,

and

.
fsis
is
proposing
that
the
use
of

not
be
permitted
in
these
products
.
fsis
recognizes
,
however
,
that
these
types
of

sometimes
are
prepared
with
components
the
characteristics
of

are
not
inconsistent

of
