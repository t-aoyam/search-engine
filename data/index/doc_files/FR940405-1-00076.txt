chose
to
rely

an

ascertained
.
the
annual

estimated

presents
the

to

per
1000
exposed
employees
.
because
section
(

)
of

that

,
osha
has
converted
the
attributable
annual
risk
into
an
attributable
lifetime
risk
on
the
assumption
that
a
worker
is
employed
in
his
or
her
occupation
for
45
years
.
lifetime
estimates
of
risk
attributable
to
occupational
ets
are
presented
in
table
iv10
.
information
contained
in
table
iv10
indicates
that
for
every
1000
workers
exposed
to
ets
,
approximately
1
will
most
likely
develop
lung
cancer
and
7
to
16
will
develop
heart
disease
if
they
are
exposed
to
ets
at
their
workplace
in
the
course
of
a
45year
year
working
lifetime
.
the
formula
used
to
calculate
lifetime
risk
estimates
the
probability
of
at
least
one
occurrence
of
disease
in
45
years
of
continuous
exposure
and
assumes
independence
of
events
from
year
to
year
.
it
also
assumes
that
the
workers
exposure
profile
and
working
conditions
that
may
affect
the
level
and
intensity
of
exposure
remain
constant
throughout
a
