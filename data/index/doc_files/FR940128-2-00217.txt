under

act
,
the
exchange
is
required
to
investigate
possible

and
,
if

,
initiate

and

.
article
v
,
section
6
of
the
exchange
constitution
and
rule
341
permit
the
exchange
to
retain
disciplinary
jurisdiction
even
after
the
termination
of
a
persons
or
an
entitys
status
as
a
member
,
member
organization
,
or
registered
employee
,
provided
that
it
gives
them
written
notice
that
it
is
retaining
jurisdiction
within
one
year
immediately
following
its
receipt
of
written
notice
of
their
termination
.
member
firms
are
required
to
file
a
termination
notice
with
the
exchange
whenever
a
registered
employee
leaves
their
employ
.
in
most
cases
,
these
reflect
voluntary
resignations
.
however
,
member
firms
are
also
required
to
file
amended
termination
notices
,
subsequent
to
the
registered
employees
departure
,
if
they
become
aware
of
customer
complaints
or
other
possible
wrongdoing
by
the
employee
.
the
exchange
has
always
taken
the
position
that
the
one
year
period
to
retain
jurisdiction
under
its
rules
begins
to
run
only
after
it
is
notified
by
the
member
firm
of
possible
violative
conduct
by
the
registered
employee
.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
logical
position
since
the
exchange
would
have
no
reason
to
retain
jurisdiction
and
initiate
an
investigation
unless
it
had
reason
to
believe
a
violation
may
have
been
committed
.
recently
,
in
an
appeal
to
the
sec
,
a
respondent
in
an
exchange
disciplinary
proceeding
asserted
that
the
exchange
lacked
jurisdiction
over
him
because
it
failed
to
notify
him
within
one
year
from
the
time
his
former
firm
filed
a
termination
notice
reporting
his
voluntary
resignation
.
in
that
case
,
the
exchange
retained
jurisdiction
within
one
year
of
receiving
an
amended
termination
notice
reporting
a
customer
complaint
against
the
registered
representative
.
the
sec
agreed
with
the
respondent
,
adopting
the
more
narrow
,
literal
reading
of
our
jurisdictional
provision
,
requiring
the
exchange
to
retain
jurisdiction
within
one
year
of
its
receipt
of
a
termination
notice
,
regardless
of
whether
such
notice
contains
any
indication
of
actionable
conduct
.
however
,
the
commission
in
its
decision
indicated
that
it
was
sensitive
to
the
exchanges
position
and
would
be
receptive
to
the
exchange
amending
its
rules
to
expressly
provide
that
the
one
year
time
period
begins
upon
receipt
of
the
original
termination
notice
or
any
subsequent
amendment
of
such
notice
,
whichever
is
later
.

by
so
amending
the
applicable
constitutional
and
rule
provisions
,
the
exchange
will
close
an
existing
gap
in
its
disciplinary
process
which
permits
possible
wrongdoers
to
escape
investigation
by
the
exchange
into
potentially
serious
misconduct
.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
cboe
and
the
nasd
have
rule
provisions
relating
to
retention
of
discipolinary
jurisdiction
comparable
to
the
changes
we
are
proposing
.
