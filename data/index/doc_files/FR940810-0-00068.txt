argued
that

had
adequate
controls

adequately
accounted

demonstrated
that

significantly
associated

both
latency

duration

work

total

in

group

that

restriction
was
significantly
associated

that

criticism

he
pointed
out

been
read

that
there

evidence

smoking

exposure
increases
appearance
of
the
small
irregular
opacities
in
the
lung
seen
on

in

study

he
further
noted
that
in
his
study
only
actively
working
custodians
were
included
and
were
therefore
a
`
survivor
'
group
and
would
therefore
not
be

to
report
pulmonary
dysfunction
frequently

claimed

responded
to
the
weill

comments

he
asserted
that
the
review
fails
to
explain
how
biases
would
significantly
increase
odds
ratios
in
the
study

that
misclassification
often
is
random
and
biases
toward
not
detecting
a
difference
between
the
study
and
control
groups

he
also
questioned
existence
of
evidence
that
smoking
without
asbestos
exposure
causes
pleural
thickening

irregular
opacities

the
review
of

the
studies

resulted

the

caution

its

there

on

pleural

be
the
only

osha
agrees
that
health
effects
such
as
lung
function
impairment
and
pleuritic
pain
would
be
considered
`
material
impairment

if
substantial
evidence
supports
the
link
to
pleural
plaques

osha
concludes
that
the
scientific
data
indicate
that
pleural
plaques
are
primarily
associated
with
asbestos
exposure
,
and
that
they
have
occurred
and
still
may
at
relatively
low
exposure
