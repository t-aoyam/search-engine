the
proposed
rule
employs
an
analogous
approach
,
permitting
ex
parte
contacts
with
a
represented
party
if
the
contacts
involve
the
investigation
of
offenses
as
to
which
the
represented
party
has
neither
been
arrested
nor
charged
in
a
criminal
or
civil
law
enforcement
proceeding
.
the
department
believes
this
approach
is
wholly
consistent
with
dr
7104
and
model
rule
42
and
the
cases
interpreting
them
.
accordingly
,
this
section
provides
that
communications
may
be
made
in
the
course
of
investigations
of
additional
,
different
or
ongoing
criminal
or
unlawful
activity
,
even
though
the
individual
is
represented
by
counsel
with
respect
to
conduct
for
which
he
or
she
has
already
been
arrested
or
charged
.
such
additional
criminal
or
unlawful
conduct
is
typically
one
of
three
varieties
:
(
1
)
conduct
that
is
separate
from
the
original
wrongful
conduct
;
(
2
)
crimes
that
are
intended
to
impede
the
trial
of
the
charged
crime
or
unlawful
conduct
,
such
as
subornation
of
perjury
,
obstruction
of
justice
,
jury
tampering
,
or
murder
,
assault
,
or
intimidation
of
witnesses
;
and
(
3
)
conduct
that
is
a
continuation
of
the
charged
crime
,
such
as
a
conspiracy
or
scheme
to
defraud
that
continues
past
the
time
of
indictment
.
the
new
or
additional
criminal
or
wrongful
activity
may
have
occurred
in
the
past
or
may
be
ongoing
at
the
time
of
the
investigation
.
by
definition
,
communications
pursuant
to
this
exception
will
take
place
when
the
represented
party
is
the
subject
of
pending
criminal
or
civil
enforcement
charges
for
which
he
or
she
is
represented
by
counsel
.
government
attorneys
must
take
extreme
care
to
avoid
violating
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
whenever
they
invoke
this
exception
in
the
criminal
context
.
in
particular
,
care
must
be
taken
to
avoid
the
deliberate
elicitation
of
incriminating
information
regarding
any
pending
criminal
charges
.
paragraph
(
f
:

or

the
supreme
court
has
recognized
that
,
in
certain
limited
situations
,
otherwise
applicable
constitutional
requirements
may
be
suspended
by
the
need
to
guard
against
threats
to
public
safety

paragraph
(
f
)
recognizes
an
analogous
exception
to
the
general
prohibition
against
communications
with
represented
parties
in
the
absence
of
their
counsel
.
it
is
the
departments
intention
that
this
exception
be
invoked
only
in
rare
circumstances
and
only
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
human
life
or
safety
.
the
exception
has
three
requirements
:
(
1
)
the
attorney
for
the
government
must
have
a
good
faith
belief
that
the
safety
or
life
of
any
person
is
threatened
;
(
2
)
the
purpose
of
the
communication
must
be
to
obtain
information
to
protect
against
the
risk
of
injury
or
death
;
and
(
3
)
the
attorney
for
the
government
must
,
in
good
faith
,
believe
that
the
communication
is
reasonably
necessary
to
protect
against
such
risk
.
these
requirements
are
imposed
to
ensure
that
the
exception
is
invoked
only
to
protect
human
life
or
safety
,
and
not
as
a
routine
matter
in
violent
crime
prosecutions
.
for
example
,
the
fact
that
potentially
dangerous
firearms
have
not
been
recovered
would
not
in
and
of
itself
be
sufficient
under
ordinary
circumstances
to
constitute
a
threat
to
safety
under
this
exception
.
furthermore
,
the
communication
must
be
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
human
life
or
safety
,
and
may
not
be
designed
to
elicit
testimonial
evidence
.
however
,
information
thus
obtained
may
be
used
for
any
purpose
consistent
with
constitutional
limitations
.
