the
agency
began
its
program
to
reduce

of
volatile

in
the
late
1970s
,
the
coating
industry
has
made
significant
progress
in
research
of
new
products
with
increased
solids
:
organic
solvent
ratios
.
these
liquid
paints
are
of
two
primary
types
:
waterborne
and
higher
solids
.
although
many
new
waterborne
products
have
been
developed
,
manufacturers
of
marine
coatings
have
reduced
solvent
primarily
by
increasing
the
solids
(
nonvolatile
)
content
of
their
products
.

of
these
concentrated
or
`
higher

'
coatings
reduce
solvent
emissions

painted
(

.
because
most
hazardous
air
pollutants
are
also
volatile
organics
,
the
voc
program
has
tended
to
also
reduce
hap
.
in
addition
,
some
coating
manufacturers
have
reportedly
been
able
to
reduce
the
hap
content
of
certain
paints
by
merely
substituting
a
solvent
not
on
the
hap
list
yielding
paints
that
contain
little
or
no
hap
solvents
.
a
coating
reformulated
in
this
manner
may
have
the
same
or
even
higher
voc
content
than
the
one
it
replaces
.
in
some
cases
,
the
hap
to
voc
ratio
may
even
increase
when
a
company
develops
a
new
reformulation
with
lower
voc

the
absolute

emissions
are
likely
to
go

there
are
several
alternatives
a
shipyard
may
follow
to
minimize
hap
emissions
from
asapplied
as
applied
paints
.
one
is
to
avoid
diluting
the
paint
and
apply
it
assupplied
as
supplied
.
another
is
to
only
use
thinners
that
contain
little
or
no
hap
.
a
third
is
to
reduce
paint
viscosity
by
heating
the
paint
to
avoid
or
minimize
the
need
for
thinning
.
(
paint
heaters
are
heating
elements
placed
in
the
paint
delivery
line
upstream
of
the
spray
gun
.
depending
on
the
length
of
the
delivery
line
,
the
coating
characteristics
,
and
ambient
temperature
,
multiple
paint
heaters
may
be
required
at
intervals
along
the
line
.
these
decrease
the
ease
of
portability
and
flexibility
of
the
application
system
)

pollution
control
systems
are
often
used
to
control
emissions
from
spray
booths
when
coatings
are
applied
in
factory
operations
.
such
systems
are
not
now
a
practical
alternative
for
many
shipyard
operations
because
the
size
of
ship
components
is
too
large
to
enable
capturing
of
the
emissions
with
an
enclosure
.
(
there
is
currently
under
development
a
mobile
enclosure
that
,
if
successful
,
will
offer
shipyards
a
method
of
capturing
both
particulate
and
volatile
organics
.
metro
machine
shipyard
in
norfolk
,
virginia
has
developed
a
prototype
portable
enclosure
that
mounts
adjacent
to
the
ship
and
supports
an
omnidirectional
omni
directional
elevator
platform
used
by
the
operator
to
abrasive
blast
and
paint
ships
hulls
.
the
method
shows
promise
of
containing
particulate
and
volatile
organics
of
concentrations
great
enough
to
make
recovery
available
at
reasonable
cost
.
it
also
provides

weather

evaluation
will
