the
impacts
of
the
revision
to
the
asbestos
standard
on
establishments
involved
in
ship
repair
are
expected
to
be
minimal
.
table
13
shows
that
average
price
impacts
would
be
0
07
percent
for
all
establishments
and
would
be
01
percent
for
small
establishments
if
firms
were
able
to
charge
increased
operating
costs
to
their
customers
,
ie
,
ship
owners
.
at
the
opposite
extreme
in
terms
of
potential
financial
impact
,
compliance
costs
as
a
percentage
of
profits
would
average
08
percent
for
firms
of
all
sizes
in
ship
repair
and
would
average
12
percent
for
small
firms
in
ship
repair
.
thus
,
osha
has
concluded
that
there
will
be
no
significant
differential
effect
on
small
businesses
involved
in
ship
repair
as
a
result
of
the
final
standard
.
