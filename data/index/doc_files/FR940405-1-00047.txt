cardiovascular

of

indicates
that
the
cardiovascular
effects
of
ets
exposure
on
the
health
of
nonsmokers
include
acute
effects
,
such
as
exacerbation
of
angina
,
as
well
as
chronic
effects
,
such
as

the

these
include

discussion
of
the
acute
and
chronic
health
effects
follows
.
(

)
thrombus
formation
.
blood
clots
in
the
coronary
arteries
are
an
important
component
of
an
acute
myocardial
infarction
(
mi
.
an
additional
component
of
the
acute
mi
is
the
presence
of
atherosclerotic
plaques
in
the
walls
of
the
coronary
arteries
.
platelets
are
involved
in
both
the
acute
formation
of
blood
clots
and
the
chronic
formation
of
atherosclerotic
plaques
.
there
is
evidence
that
ets
exposure
can
cause
platelets
to
become
more
easily
activated
thus
predisposing
the
platelets
to
become
involved
in
forming
clots
and
atherosclerotic
plaques
.
for
example
,
evidence
exists
that
demonstrates
that
the
platelets
of
nonsmokers
exposed
to
ets
are
more
easily
activated
[
exs
.
440
,
480
.
the
study
by
burghuber
[
exs
.
440
]
demonstrates
that
the
platelet
activating
capabilities
of
ets
are
more
prominent
in
nonsmokers
than
in
smokers
.
the
results
of
this
study
suggest
that
nonsmokers
are
at
a
greater
risk
of
blood
clot
formation
secondary
to
ets
exposure
than
smokers
.
acute
ets
exposure
also
results
in
an
increased
platelet
aggregation
,
which
is
an
initial
stage
of
the
development
of
coronary
thrombosis
or
vasoconstriction
.
this
vasoconstriction
can
lead
to
the
development
of
coronary
atherosclerosis
after
chronic
exposure
[
exs
.
4111
,

,

vascular
wall
injury
.
atherosclerotic
plaque
formation
is
a
complicated
chronic
process
that
can
lead
to
constriction
of
the
lumen
of
the
blood
vessels
,
resulting
in
reduced
blood
supply
to
the
myocardial
tissues
.
it
is
thought
that
an
essential
step
in
plaque
formation
is
injury
to
the
endothelial
lining
of
the
arterial
wall
.
ets
has
been
implicated
in
causing
injury
to
the
endothelial
cells
which
line
the
arterial
walls
.
this
was
demonstrated
in
the
study
by
davis
et
al
.
[
ex
.
480
]
which
identified
an
increase
in
the
number
of
endothelial
cell
carcasses
in
the
circulation
of
healthy
people
after
being
exposed
to
ets
.
ets
has
also
been
implicated
in
stimulating
smooth
muscle
cell
proliferation
and
in
altering
blood
lipids
.
each
of
these
can
contribute
to
plaque
formation
which
leads
to
an
increased
susceptibility
to
heart
attacks
.
(
c
)
possible
mechanisms
of
effect
.
at
least
three
mechanisms
are
described
in
the
literature
by
which
ets
may
place
stress
on
the
heart
by
increasing
myocardial
oxygen
demand
,
decreasing
myocardial
oxygen
supply
or
interfering
with
the
cells
ability
to
utilize
oxygen
for
energy
production
.
one
mechanism
by
which
ets
may
reduce
oxygen
supply
is
through
the
formation
of
carboxyhemoglobin
.
carboxyhemoglobin
is
formed
when
a
person
is
exposed
to
carbon
monoxide
,
a
component
of
ets
.
the
carbon
monoxide
effectively
competes
with
oxygen
for
the
heme
group
of
the
hemoglobin
molecule
in
the
red
blood
cell
(
rbc
.
in
fact
,
carbon
monoxide
has
a
much
greater
affinity
for
hemoglobin
than
does
oxygen
and
binds
very
strongly
with
hemoglobin
making
it
unavailable
for
the
transport
of
oxygen
.
the
heart
muscle
(
myocardium
)
can
experience
injury
at
the
cellular
level
when
the
oxygen
demanded
by
the
heart
muscle
exceeds
the
oxygen
supplied
by
the
blood
.
therefore
,
the
formation
of
carboxyhemoglobin
can
decrease
the
ability
of
the
blood
to
deliver
oxygen
to
the
myocardium
and
can
cause
injury
to
the
heart
if
myocardial
oxygen
demand
exceeds
supply
.
