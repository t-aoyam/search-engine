this
section
differs
significantly
from

more
closely
to
follow
the

and

differentiate
between
those
individuals
who
are
represented
by
counsel
and
have
become
a
party
to
a
proceeding
,
and
those
represented
individuals
who
are
not
parties
to
any
relevant
proceedings

an
individual
is
considered
to
be
a
`

party
'
under
these
rules
if
:
(

)
the
person
is
represented
by
counsel
;
(

)
the
representation
is
current
and
concerns
the
subject
matter
in
question
;
and
(

)
the
person
has
either
been
arrested
or
charged
in
a
federal
criminal
case
or
is
a
defendant
in
a
civil
law
enforcement
proceeding
concerning
the
subject
matter
of
the
representation
.
if
the
person
is
currently
represented
in
fact
regarding
the
subject
matter
in
question
,
but
has
not
been
charged
or
arrested
,
that
person
is
considered
a
`

'
thus
,
witnesses
,
suspects
and
targets
of
investigations
who
have
not

are
considered

section
775
of
this
rule
generally
prohibits
government
attorneys
from
initiating
ex
parte
contacts
with
represented
parties
,
but
does
not
prohibit
ex
parte
contacts
with
represented
persons
.
(
however
,
§
778
and
779
prohibit
some
contacts
with
represented
persons
as
well
)
this
distinction
between
represented
parties
and
represented
persons
is
consistent
with
the
rulings
of
the
vast
majority
of
federal
courts
to
consider
the
issue

section
774
constitutional
and
other
limitations
this
section
is
substantially
similar
to
the
corresponding
section
in
the
earlier
proposal
.
the
section
has
been
revised
slightly
to
make
clear
that
although
the
proposed
rule
does
not
supersede
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
,
this
limitation
does
not
extend
to
other
rules
regarding
procedure
in
federal
courts
.
thus
,
rules
of
procedure
adopted
by
individual
courts
as
local
rules
,
many
of
which
incorporate
state
bar
rules
,
are
not
included
in
this
limitation
.
section
775
general
rule
for
civil
and
criminal
enforcement
;
represented
parties
this
section
,
as
well
as
sections
776
through
779
,
differs
substantially
from
corresponding
sections
contained
in
the
earlier
proposal
.
this
section
closely
tracks
the
language
of
dr
7104a1
)
and
rule
42
and
applies
similar
prohibitions
to
attorneys
for
the
government
.
the
section
prohibits
an
attorney
for
the
government
from
communicating
with
a
represented
party
,
as
defined
in
§
773
,
about
the
subject
matter
of
the
representation
without
the
consent
of
that
individuals
attorney
.
the
prohibition
applies
,
however
,
only
if
the
attorney
for
the
government
knows
that
the
represented
party
is
,
in
fact
,
represented
by
counsel
.
therefore
,
communications
by
an
attorney
for
the
government
with
a
represented
party
will
not
violate
this
rule
if
the
attorney
for
the
government
is
unaware
of
the
fact
of
representation
.
this
section
also
prohibits
an
attorney
for
the
government
from
causing
another
individual
to
communicate
with
a
represented
party
.
accordingly
,
a
government
investigator
acting
at
the
attorneys
direction
and
control
may
not
do
what
the
attorney
himself
or
herself
is
prohibited
from
doing
.
conversely
,
a
government
attorney
will
not
be
personally
responsible
for
the
actions
of
agents
in
communicating
with
represented
persons
unless
,
in
doing
so
,
the
agents
were
acting
as
the
attorneys
