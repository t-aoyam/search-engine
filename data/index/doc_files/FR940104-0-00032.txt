one
of

that

a

in
response
to
the
proposed
rule

45
responses

each
containing
one

that
pertained

however
,
the
regulations
that

applied
only
to
the
nutrition
labeling
of
foods
in
conventional
food
form

they
did
not
apply

on
the
implementation
of

section

of
the

required
that
the
secretary

,
and
by
delegation
fda
,
issue
new
proposed
regulations
that
are
applicable

and
final
regulations
by

in
response
to
this
provision
,
fda
issued
the
06/18/1993
(
58

proposal
and
is
now
issuing
this
final
rule
.
in
addition
,
elsewhere
in
this
issue
of
the
federal

,
,
fda
is
issuing
final
regulations
that
address
the
use
of
nutrient
content
claims
and
health
claims
on
dietary
supplements
.
in
addition
,
section
203
of
the

instructed
fda
not
to
promulgate

they

be
addressed

about
half
of
the
comments
supported
the
proposal
;
about
half
of
these
comments
supported
it
without
modification
.
these
comments
were
primarily
from
health
professionals
,
although
a
few
were
from
that
segment
of
the
food
industry
that
produces
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
the
remainder
of
the
comments
that
supported
the
proposal
suggested
modifications
in
various
provisions
of
the
proposal
.
about
half
of
the
comments
opposed
the
proposal

these
comments
were
primarily
from
consumers

suggested
changes

agencys
responses

scope
of
new
§
101

1
.
one
comment
from
a
manufacturer
of
dietary
supplements
supported
the
proposed
rule
to
allow
only
vitamins
and
minerals
that
have
rdis
or
daily
reference
values
(
drvs
)
to
be
listed
in
the
nutrition
label
of
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
.
however
,
several
comments
wanted
nonrdi
rdi
vitamins
and
minerals
to
be
listed
,
particularly
those
in
the
nass
`
recommended
dietary
allowances
'
(
ie
,
chloride
,
chromium
,
fluoride
,
manganese
,
molybdenum
,
selenium
,
and
vitamin
k
.
the
comments
pointed
out
that
advances
in
scientific
knowledge
have
shown
that
these
nutrients
are
considered
essential
to
human
health
.
some
comments
also
suggested
listing
nutrients
such
as
arsenic
,
boron
,
silicon
,
tin
,
and
vanadium
that
they
stated
are
of
major
significance
in
human
nutrition
.
some
of
these
comments
suggested
that
an
asterisk
in
the
`
percent
daily
value
'
column
could
refer
to
a
footnote
,
such
as
`
no
daily
value
has
been
established
for
this
nutrient
'
another
comment
suggested
that
these
additional
nutrients
could
be
listed
in
a
subsection
of
the
nutrition
panel
below
the
bar
after
the
last
nutrient
for
which
there
is
an
rdi
or
drv
.
one
comment
stated
that
to
put
information
on
nutrients
of
this
type
outside
of
the
`
nutrition
facts
'
box
would
be
inconvenient
and
may
cause
some
consumers
to
overlook
the
presence
of
these
additional
nutrients
,
some
of
which
should
not
be
consumed
in
excess
.
the
agency
is
persuaded
that
it
is
appropriate
to
allow
the
nutrients
that
are
listed
as
being
essential
to
humans
in
the
nass
`
recommended
dietary
allowances
'
(

and

but
for
which
fda
has
not
established
rdis
,
to
be
declared
in
the
nutrition
label
of
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
when
they
are
present
in
supplements
at
more
than
insignificant
amounts
.
the
agency
agrees
that
there
have
been
significant
advances
in
scientific
knowledge
with
respect
to
essential
nutrient
requirements
since
1968
.
in
1989
,
the
nas
updated
its
rdas
to
include
values
for
vitamin
k
and
selenium
and
to
make
significant
revisions
in
the
allowances
for
several
nutrients
including
vitamin
b6
,
folate
(
folic
acid
,
vitamin
b12
,
magnesium
,
iron
and
zinc
(
ref
.

.
in
addition
,
scientific
advances
permitted
the
nas
to
revise
the
values
,
known
as
`
estimated
safe
and
adequate
daily
dietary
intakes
'
(
esaddis
)
in
1980
for
chloride
(
ref
.

)
and
in
1989
,
for
three
nutrients
(
biotin
,
pantothenic
acid
,
and
copper
,
for
which
fda
established
us
.
rdas
in
1973
,
and
to
establish
new
esaddis
for
manganese
,
fluoride
,
chromium
,
and
molybdenum
(
ref
.
2
.
it
was
in
response
to
these
scientific
advances
that
fda
proposed
rdis
in
the
federal
register
of
11/27/1991
(
56
fr
60366
at
60390
and
60393
)
for
the
nutrients
mentioned
previously
that
are
included
in
the
1980
and
the
1989
nas
rdas
but
for
which
rdis
have
not
been
established
(
ie
,
chloride
,
chromium
,
fluoride
,
manganese
,
molybdenum
,
selenium
,
and
vitamin
k
.
the
establishment
of
rdis
would
have
allowed
these
nutrients
to
be
listed
on
the
nutrition
label
of
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
as
well
of
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
however
,
as
stated
above
,
section
203
of
the
ds
act
instructed
fda
not
to
promulgate
regulations
that
require
the
use
of
,
or
that
are
based
upon
,
recommended
daily
allowances
of
vitamins
or
minerals
before
11/08/1993
,
other
than
those
specified
in
§
1019c7iv
,
as
in
effect
on
10/06/1992
.
in
accordance
with
this
provision
of
the
ds
act
,
the
agency
issued
a
final
rule
on
01/06/1993
(
58
fr
2206
)
that
retained
the
former
us
.
rda
values
.
as
a
result
,
the
final
rule
did
not
include
rdis
for
chloride
,
chromium
,
fluoride
,
manganese
,
molybdenum
,
selenium
,
and
vitamin
k
.
because
the
prohibition
in
section
203
of
the
ds
act
has
now
expired
,
the
agency
is
proposing
,
elsewhere
in
this
issue
of
the
federal
register
,
,
to
establish
rdi
values
for
those
nutrients
listed
by
the
nas
as
being
essential
to
humans
and
that
do
not
already
have
rdi
values
.
the
agency
is
proposing
this
action
because
these
nutrients
are
essential
for
the
maintenance
of
good
health
in
humans
.
in
recognition
of
the
essentiality
of
these
nutrients
and
in
response
to
the
comments
summarized
above
,
the
agency
is
requiring
in
new
§
101
36
)
that
chloride
,
chromium
,
fluoride
,
manganese
,
molybdenum
,
selenium
and
vitamin
k
be
included
in
the
nutrition
label
when
present
in
the
dietary
supplement
.
the
agency
also
is
providing
in
§
101
36
)
that
if
any
of
these
nutrients
are
declared
,
they
are
to
be
followed
by
an
asterisk
in
the
`
percent
daily
value
'
column
.
the
asterisk
is
to
refer
to
another
asterisk
that
is
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
and
that
is
followed
by
the
statement
`
daily
value
not
established
'
this
action
is
a
logical
outgrowth
of
the
nutrition
labeling
proposal
for
dietary
supplements
because
that
proposal
put
into
issue
the
question
of
whether
the
list
of
nutrients
that
fda
proposed
be
included
in
the
nutrition
label
under
§
§
101
36
was
the
appropriate
list
.
the
comments
have
persuaded
fda
that
the
list
needs
to
be
expanded
in
the
manner
described
in
this
final
rule
.
fda
is
not
persuaded
,
however
,
that
other
trace
elements
for
which
the
nas
has
not
established
rdas
or
esaddis
should
be
declared
within
the
nutrition
label
.
the
comments
that
suggested
that
such
elements
be
included
on
the
label
provided
some
published
reports
that
certain
of
these
elements
have
been
found
to
be
essential
in
the
diets
of
various
animals
but
did
not
provide
sufficient
evidence
for
the
agency
to
conclude
that
there
is
scientific
consensus
about
their
essentiality
for
the
maintenance
of
good
health
in
humans
.
the
agency
strongly
believes
that
evidence
of
the
usefulness
of
a
nutrient
for
humans
is
necessary
before
that
nutrient
can
be
allowed
to
be
listed
within
the
nutrition
label
.
this
policy
is
consistent
with
current
§
1019i5
)
(
redesignated
and
revised
in
the
01/06/1993
,
final
rules
,
as
§
1019k5
)
which
prohibits
a
foods
label
from
stating
or
implying
that
the
food
has
special
dietary
properties
because
of
the
presence
of
a
substance
when
,
in
fact
,
the
usefulness
of
the
substance
has
not
been
established
in
human
nutrition
.
in
addition
,
in
its
proposed
rule
on
mandatory
nutrition
labeling
(
55
fr
29487
at
29493
,
07/19/1990
,
fda
stated
that
it
was
concerned
about
the
possibility
of
a
large
number
of
nutrients
being
listed
in
nutrition
labeling
and
about
the
way
in
which
their
presence
on
the
label
may
be
interpreted
by
consumers
.
fda
expressed
concern
that
the
presence
of
a
large
number
of
nutrients
could
be
misinterpreted
as
implying
that
a
food
has
a
greater
public
health
significance
than
may
be
the

the
potential
for
this
happening
and
misleading
the
consumer
about
the
contribution
of
the
food

human
nutrition
is
especially
likely
if
the
nutrition
label
were
to
include
nutrients
not
known
to
be
important
to
humans

therefore
,
fda
believes
that
foods
that
list
such
nutrients
in
the

would
be
misbranded
under
section
403a

of
the
act

prohibits
misleading
information
on

of

however
,
statements

be
made

discussed
in

elsewhere
in

specifying

the

the

comments
stated
that

of
other
nutritional

should
be
labeled
under

one
of
these

said
it
would
be
less
confusing
if

they
have

one
of

agreed
that
fda
did
not
have
the
authority
to
exempt
dietary

wanted
an
amendment
to
the
1990
amendments
that
would
exempt
these
dietary

this
comment
said
that
dietary

are
not
normally
consumed
for
their
nutritive
value
,
and
that
nutrition
labeling
on
these
products
is
irrelevant

unimportant

as
explained
in
the

labeling
proposal
for
dietary
supplements
(

the
difference
in
the
labeling
of
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
or
minerals
and
of
dietary
supplements
of
herbs
and
of
other
similar
nutritional
substances
is
a
result
of
section

of
the
act
.
as
stated
above
,
this
section
provides
that
if
a
food
to
which
section
411
of
the
act
applies
(
ie
,
a
dietary
supplement
of
vitamins
or

contains
one
or
more
of
the
nutrients
required
to
be
listed
in

,
the
label
or
labeling
of
such
food
is
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
section

)
and
(
q2
)
of
the
act
in
a
manner
that
fda
determines
,
by
regulation
,
is
appropriate
for
such
food
.
other
dietary
supplements
are
not
subject
to
section
403q5f
)
of
the
act
and
thus
are
subject
to
regulation
under
section
403q
)
of
the
act
in
the
same
manner
as
any
other
food
.
there
is
nothing
in
the
1990
amendments
,
or
elsewhere
in
the
act
,
that
would
allow
the
agency
to
exempt
the
broad
category
of
dietary
supplements
of
herbs
and
of
other
similar
nutritional
substances
from
section
403q1
)
and
(
q2
)
of
the
act
.
thus
,
supplements
that
are
not
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
are
appropriately
subject
to
nutrition
labeling
under
§
1019
.
under
§
1019
,
the
nutrition
label
of
dietary
supplements
of
herbs
and
of
other
similar
nutritional
substances
may
be
presented
in
either
a
full
or
simplified
format
as
specified
in
§
1019d
)
or
(
f
.
the
simplified
format
in
§
1019f
)
may
be
used
when
a
supplement
of
herbs
or
of
other
similar
nutritional
substances
contains
insignificant
amounts
of
seven
or
more
of
the
following
nutrients

dietary
fiber
,
sugars
,
protein
,
vitamin
a

vitamin
c
,
calcium
,
and
iron

fda
is
not
persuaded
that
nutrition
labels
on
dietary
supplements
of
herbs
using
the
simplified
format
should
be
exempt
from
the
requirement
to
declare
the
`
core
'
nutrients
(
ie
,
calories
,
total
fat
,
sodium
,
total
carbohydrate
,
and
protein
.
the
agency
has
stated
its
belief
in
the
mandatory
nutrition
labeling
final
rule
(
58
fr
2079
at
2142
)
that
this
core
information
is
essential
to
aid
consumers
in
learning
about
the
relative
nutritional
qualities
of
all
foods
,
and
the
information
allows
consumers
to
judge
the
consequences
of
the
food
selections
they
make
.
no
new
information
was
presented
in
the
comments
to
change
fdas
position
on
this
issue
.
the
agency
also
advises
that
§
1019j4
)
provides
that
foods
subject
to
§
1019
,
including
dietary
supplements
of
herbs
and
of
other
similar
nutritional
substances
,
are
exempt
from
nutrition
labeling
requirements
when
all
of
the
nutrients
required
to
be
declared
under
§
1019c
)
are
absent
or
are
present
in
insignificant
amounts
.
fda
is
also
not
persuaded
that
nutrition
labels
on
supplements
of
herbs
should
be
excused
from
listing
`
percent
daily
values
'
as
called
for
in
section
2b1a
)
of
the
1990
amendments
,
a
primary
purpose
of
the
nutrition
label
is
to
help
consumers
make
informed
food
choices
by
enabling
them
to
both
comprehend
the
nutritional
value
of
the
food
and
to
understand
its
relative
significance
in
the
context
of
the
total
daily
diet
.
the
consumer
research
that
the
agency
reviewed
in
the
mandatory
nutrition
labeling
final
rule
supports
fdas
assertion
that
the
listing
of
percent
daily
value
improves
consumers
'
abilities
to
make
correct
dietary
judgments
about
a
food
in
the
context
of
a
total
daily
diet
(
58
fr
2079
at
2125
.
in
part
,
this
improved
ability
to
make
judgments
is
achieved
by
the
use
of
a
consistent
system
of
percentages
,
so
that
virtually
all
the
nutrients
on
the
label
can
be
declared
in
equivalent
units
.
also
,
the
percentages
communicate
information
about
the
nutrient
level
in
a
food
without
the
consumer
having
to
be
concerned
about
the
absolute
level
or
units
of
the
underlying
scale
being
used
.
therefore
,
for
the
reasons
stated
,
the
agency
has
not
acceded
to
the
requests
that
dietary
supplements
of
herbs
and
of
other
similar
nutritional
substances
be
labeled
under
§
101
36
,
have
their
own
format
for
nutrition
labeling
,
be
exempt
from
all
nutrition
labeling
,
or
be
exempt
from
declaring
the
`
core
'
nutrients
and
the
`
percent

one
comment

that
the
language
of

be
revised
to
refer
to
`

instead
of
`
dietary
supplements

this
comment
was
concerned
that
alfalfa
tablets
that
have
calcium
as
a
binder
would
be
required
to
be
labeled
under
§
101
36
.
the
agency
would
like
to
make
clear
that
it
does
not
consider
a
product
that
contains
a
substance
that
is
a
vitamin
or
a
mineral
,
but
that
is
used
in
the
food
solely
for
technological
purposes
,
to
be
a
dietary
supplement
of
a
vitamin
or
mineral
because
of
the
presence
of
that
substance
.
in
these
circumstances
,
the
product
would
not
be
represented
as
supplying
a
vitamin
or
mineral
(
see
section
411c
)
of
the
act
.
thus
,
alfalfa
tablets
that
have
calcium
as
a
binder
would
be
required
to
be
labeled
under

a
few
comments
requested
clarification
of
the
type
of
nutrition
labeling
that
would
be
required
for
`
combination
'
products
that
contain
herbs
with
added
vitamins

the
agency
advises
that
the
type
of
nutrition
labeling
that
would
be
required
for
products
that
contain
herbs
and
added
vitamins
would
depend
upon
the
contents
of
the
product
as
well
as
how
the
product
is
represented
.
if
a
`
combination
'
product
is
primarily
a
dietary
supplement
of
vitamins
and
minerals
and
is
marketed
as
such
,
the
product
would
have
to
be
labeled
in
accordance
with
§
101
36
.
if
the
product
is
not
primarily
a
dietary
supplement
of
vitamins
or
minerals
and
is
not
represented
as
such
,
it
would
have
to
be
labeled
in
accordance
with
§
1019
.
the
agency
believes
that
the
manufacturer
makes
the
determination
as
to
whether
a
product
is
primarily
a
dietary
supplement
of
an
herb
,
of
vitamins
or
minerals
,
or
of
a
`
similar
nutritional
substance
'
based
on
how
it
labels
and
formulates
the
product
.
the
types
of
claims
that
are
made
on
a
dietary
supplement
will
both
determine
,
and
be
limited
by
,
whether
it
is
a
dietary
supplement
of
vitamins
or
minerals
or
of
herbs
or
of
other
nutritional
substances
.

of
the

states
that
the
labeling

not
give
prominence
to
or
emphasize
ingredients
that
are
not
vitamins
,
minerals
,
or
represented
as
a
source
of
vitamins
or
minerals
.
thus
,
if
,
for
example
,
a
dietary
supplement
of
an
herbal
extract
adds
vitamins
and
minerals

remains
primarily
a
dietary
supplement

the
herbal
extract

is
advertised
as
such
,
section

the

this
would
be
the

at

stated
that

other
comments
supported
the
proposed
rule
stating
that
serving
size
information
should
be
declared
in

the
agency
believes
that
information
on
serving
size
is
as
essential
on
the
nutrition
label
of
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
as
it
is
on
that
of
foods
in
conventional
food

first
,
this
information
may
not
be
given
in
the
directions

for
instance
,
the
directions
may
state
`
take
3
tablets

without
indicating
if
they
are
to
be
taken
at
one
setting
as
one

spread
out

thus
,
it
is
fair
to
conclude
that
in
many
instances
the
serving
size
will
not
be
duplicative
.
additionally
,
this
information
quickly
informs
the
consumer
about
the
amount
of
the
product
that
contains
the
levels
of
nutrients
declared
.
it
also
provides

one
comment
stated
that
the
reference
amounts
for
dietary

should
be
specified
in
absolute
terms
but
did
not
provide
any
data

the
comment
argued
that
absolute
amounts
are
needed

that
if
comparative

are
made
,
one

not

to

recommending
five

.
a
few
other
comments
supported
the
proposed
definition
for
reference
amounts
.
the
agency
has
defined
the
reference
amount
customarily
consumed
for
a
dietary
supplement
in
§
101

)
as
`
the
maximum
amount
recommended
on

,
in
the
absence
of
recommendations
,
one
tablet
,
capsule
,

,
or
teaspoonful
,
as
appropriate
'
as
discussed
in
the
nutrition
labeling
proposal
on
dietary
supplements
(
54
fr
33715
at
33716
,
the
agency
relied
upon
labeling
recommendations
in
this
definition
because
it
believed
that
consumption
is
determined
in
large
part
by
the
amount
recommended
on
the
label
of
these
products
,
and
it
lacked
the
data
to
specify
absolute
amounts
.
the
agency
requested
comments
on
this
approach
in
the
proposal
.
no
comments
provided
data
for
the
agency
to
use
in
determining
absolute
amounts
that
could
be
used
as
reference
amounts
.
therefore
,
the
reference
amount
for
dietary
supplements
will
continue
to
be
based
on
labeling
recommendations
.
the
agency
does
not
agree
with
the
comment
that
absolute
amounts
are
needed
to
prevent
a
product
with
a
1
tablespoon
serving
from
being
compared
to
a
product
with
a
5
tablespoon
serving
.
lacking
data
to
the
contrary
,
the
agency
must
assume
that
the
recommended
amount
on
the
label
is
the
amount
customarily
consumed
.
based
on
that
assumption
,
it
is
consistent
with

general
principles
for
nutrient
content
claims
,
which
provides
for
comparative
claims
to
be
based

this
topic
as
it
relates
to
comparative
claims
is
further
discussed
in

a
few
comments
stated
that
the
term
`
serving
size
'
is
confusing
on
dietary
supplements
.
a
few
comments
had
questions
about
the
determination
of
serving
size
,
and
one
of
these
comments
requested
that
the
term
`
recommended
intake
'
be
used
instead
of
the
term
`
serving
size
'
another
comment
suggested
that
the
term
`
minimum
recommended
serving
size
'
be
used
when
the
label
directions
specify
a
range
of
possible
intakes
for
a
product
(
eg
,
two
to
three
tablets
per
day
.
this
comment
was
concerned
that
`
someone
reading
only
the
nutritional
information
portion
of
the
label
will
think
that
the
serving
amount
listed
there
is
the
recommended
amount
when
it
is
really
the
maximum
recommended
amount
'
other
comments
disagreed
with
this
position
and
supported
the
proposed
rule
which
stated
that
the
serving
size
should
refer
to
the
maximum
amount
when
a
range
is
specified
for
a
product
.
one
comment
asked
what
the
serving
size
is
when
the
label
recommends
one
to
four
tablets
per
day
.
this
comment
also
asked
about
serving
size
when
the
label
recommends
two
tablets
a
day
.
another
comment
supported
the
statement
in
the
proposal
that
if
there
is
no
amount
recommended
on
the
label
,
the
serving
size
is
one
unit
of
the
supplement
.
this
comment
observed
that
the
issue
arises
as
to
how
a
determination
can
be
made
of
`
servings
per
container
'
if
there
is
no
recommendation
as
to
serving
size
.
the
comment
stated
that
this
issue
needs
to
be
considered
to
avoid
a
regulatory
gap
.
the
agency
is
not
persuaded
that
a
term
other
than
`
serving
size
'
should
be
used
to
describe
the
basis
for
nutrient
declaration
for
dietary
supplements
.
it
would
be
confusing
for
consumers
if
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
used
a
term
such
as
`
recommended
intake
'
and
other
foods
used
the
term
`
serving
size
'
as
discussed
in
the
nutrition
labeling
proposal
on
dietary
supplements
(
58
fr
33715
at
33716
,
the
agency
proposed
that
the
nutrition
labeling
of
vitamin
or
mineral
supplements
be
presented
in
a
manner
that
is
as
similar
as
possible
to
the
nutrition
labeling
of
other
foods
.
the
agency
believes
that
use
of
the
same
term
on
all
labels
will
help
to
avoid
confusion
.
as
use
of
the
new
nutrition
label
becomes
more
widespread
,
and
consumers
become
familiar
with
it
,
they
will
come
to
understand
that
the
serving
size
represents
the
amount
of
product
that
they
are
likely
to
consume
in
one
eating
occasion
.
thus
,
they
will
come
to
understand
that
for
a
dietary
supplement
,
the
serving
size
represents
the
amount
of
that
product
that
they
are
likely
to
consume
at
those
times
that
they
decide
to
take
the
supplement
.
as
explained
in
the
proposal
of
06/18/1993
(
58
fr
33715
at
33716
,
the
agency
believes
that
it
is
more
useful
for
consumers
to
have
the
serving
size
be
based
on
the
maximum
amount
recommended
,
and
to
have
the
nutrition
information
be
reported
on
this
basis
,
than
to
have
serving
size
be
based
on
the
minimum
or
the
average
amount
.
however
,
in
some
cases
,
the
serving
size
is
the
same
regardless
of
whether
the
maximum
or
minimum
amount
is
used
.
for
example
,
if
label
directions
recommend
a
range
of
one
to
three
tablets
per
day
,
the
serving
size
is
one
tablet
based
on
the
fact
that
there
are
three
separate
eating
occasions
per
day
.
if
label
directions
recommend
a
range
of
one
to
four
tablets
per
day
,
the
serving
size
is
also
one
tablet
given
the
rounding
rules
(
ie
,
four
divided
by
three
,
rounded
off
to
one
.
as
for
the
question
what
is
the
serving
size
if
the
label
recommends
two
tablets
per
day
,
the
serving
size
would
also
be
one
tablet
because
of
rounding
.
in
the
absence
of
recommendations
on
the
label
,
a
serving
size
of
one
unit
is
appropriate
for
determining
the
`
serving
size
'
and
the
`
servings
per
container
'
when
the
serving
is
one
unit
,
the
number
of
servings
per
container
would
duplicate
the
number
of
units
declared
on
the
principal
display
panel
.
to
avoid
redundancy
the
agency
is
providing
in
§
101
36
,
as
proposed
,
that
information
on
servings
per
container
need
not
be
provided
when
the
identical
information
is
stated
in
the
net
quantity
of
contents
declaration
.
however
,
dietary
supplements
in
liquid
or
powdered
form
will
have
to
declare
`
servings
per
container
'
because
the
net
quantity
of
contents
information
will
be
reported
in
net
volume
or
net
weight
measures
,
such
as
fluid
ounces
or
grams
(

,
while
the
serving
size
will
be
expressed
in
common
household
measures
,
such
as

in
conclusion
,
the
agency
has
reexamined
the
proposed
rule
with
respect
to
these

that

the
agency
proposed
dual
declaration
when
more
than

to
be
consumed

more
fully
inform
consumers

the
agency
received
a
number
of
comments
opposing
the
dual
declaration
of
nutrition
information
on
supplements
.
some
of
these
comments
supported
declaration
on
the
basis
of
`
per
day
'
because
they
believed
that
it
is
the
total
daily
amount
of
nutrients
that
is
important
.
other
comments
favored
a
`
per
unit
'
basis
because
some
consumers
may
deviate
from
the
recommended
intake
,
or
the
intake
may
be
presented

in
the

the
mandatory
nutrition
labeling
final
rule
of
01/06/1993
(

at

,
the
agency
stated
that
dual
declaration
may
create
a
readability
problem
for
consumers
,
and
that
in
general
a
`
per
unit
'
approach
was
more
useful
than
a
`

'
approach
.
in
the
nutrition
labeling
proposal
for
dietary
supplements
(
58
fr
33715
at
33717
,
however
,
the
agency
took
a
different
approach
.
it
stated
that
it
had
tentatively
concluded
that
declaration
on
the
basis
of
`
per
serving
'
is
preferable
because
reporting
information
solely
on
a
`
per
unit
'
basis
could
confuse
consumers
when
more
that
one
unit
is
to
be
consumed
at
one
time
(
eg
,
two
capsules
with
each
meal
.
the
agency
expressed
concern
that
if
consumers
do
not
notice
or
do
not
understand
the
heading
that
states
`
per
unit
'
they
might
assume
that
the
information
is
for
the
amount
specified
for
consumption
at
one
time
(
ie
,
`
per
serving
,
particularly
because
information
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
is
expressed
on
a
`
per
serving
'
basis
.
furthermore
,
the
agency
tentatively
concluded
that
consistency
with
the
labeling
of
foods
in
conventional
food
form
in
this
regard
is
the
best
approach
because
it
will
reduce
consumer
confusion
(
58

.
inasmuch
as
most
of
the
comments
supported
the
proposed
rule
on
this
issue
,
and
comments
opposing
did
not
provide
any
information
demonstrating
that
there
is
enhanced
consumer
understanding
or
ease
of
use
when
information
is

the
agency
is
not
changing

in
response
to
these
comments
.
fda

reconsidered
its
position

however
,
in
light
of
the
comments

the
agency
concludes
that
where
the
serving
size
is
one

,
there
is
little
,
if
any
,
chance
for
misunderstanding
if
either
of
these
terms
is
used
in

of
the

therefore
,
the
agency
is
revising

to
state
that
when
the
serving
size
of
the
product
is
one
unit
,
a

consistent
with
the
declaration
of

,
such
as
`

may
be
used
in

appropriate
terms

may
be
used

several
comments
recommended
that
information
on

by

for
the
nutrients
listed
should
be
presented
in
a
separate
column
,
rather
than
immediately
following
nutrient
names
.
these
comments
stated
that
some
consumers
buy
on
the
basis
of
amounts
,
using
them
to
make
product
comparisons
,
and
that
separate
columns
would
help
consumers
to
more
readily
locate
this
information
.
an
additional
comment
requested
that
information
on
amounts
be
presented
either
in
a
separate
column
or
after
the
`
percent
daily
value
'
in

.
on
the
other
hand
,
several
comments
supported
the
proposed
rule
,
arguing
that
the
format
for
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
or
minerals
should
follow
the
format
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
the
agency
disagrees
with
the
recommendation
that
information
on
the
quantitative
amount
by
weight
for
the
nutrients
listed
should
be
presented
in
a
separate
column
.
the
agency
observes
that
space
on
the
label
is
conserved
by
not
requiring
a
separate
column
.
furthermore
,
fda
believes
that
the
comprehensibility
of
this
information
will
be
enhanced
when
it
is
presented
immediately
next
to
the
name
of
the
nutrient
.
as
discussed
in
the
mandatory
nutrition
labeling
final
rule
(
58
fr
2079
at
2117
,
multiple
column
nutrient
information
displays
are
much
more
difficult
than
single
column
displays
for
consumers
to
use
for
product
comparisons
.
both
fdas
first
experimental
format
study
and
the
major
industry
format
study
found
that
declaring
nutrient
amounts
per
serving
in
adjacent
columns
of
grams
per
milligram
(
g
mg
)
amounts
and
percent
daily
value
led

to
make
more

and
to
take
longer
on
the

type
of

(

and

fdas
second
experimental

however
,
showed
that

was
placed
immediately
next
to
the

,
the

disappeared

thus
,
the
agency
is
requiring
in
§
101

)
that
the
name
of
each
nutrient
listed
shall
be
immediately
followed
by
the
quantitative
amount

of
the

to
be
consistent
with

a
few
comments
requested
that
only
the
calcium
portion
of
calcium
gluconate
be
listed
in
the
nutrition
panel
and
on
the
principal
display
panel
.
similarly
,
another
comment
requested
that
the
agency
clarify
that
vitamin
b6
refers
to
pyridoxine
,
not
pyridoxine
hydrochloride
.
the
agency
wishes
to
emphasize
that
the
declaration
of
the
quantitative
amount
by
weight
in
the
nutrition
label
is
to
indicate
the
weight
of
a
particular
nutrient
and
not
the
weight
of
the
salt
of
that
nutrient
used
to
make
the
supplement
.
for
example
,
only
the
calcium
portion
of
calcium
gluconate
is
to
be
declared
in
the
nutrition
label
,
although
in
some
circumstances
the
weight
of
the
whole
substance
may
appear
on
the
principal
display
panel
if
it
clearly
refers
to
the
whole
substance
,
such
as
when
the
statement
of
identity
states

the

one

,
not

and
that
calcium
and
phosphorus
be
declared

the
comment
stated
that
consumers
are
more
familiar

to
change

the

however
,
section

from
adopting
any
reference
values
for

accordingly
,
fda
adopted

rdis
,
with
biotin
and

.
since
the
prohibition
in
section

of
the

act
has
now
expired
,
the
agency
is
proposing
elsewhere
in
this
issue
of
the
federal
register
to
amend
§
1019
to
change
the
units
of
declaration
for
biotin
and
folate
to

mug
and
for
calcium
and
phosphorus
to

.
this
proposal
responds
fully
to
the
comment
.
14
.
one
comment
was
opposed
to
the
agencys
proposal
,
in
§
101
36
,
to
allow
amounts
of
protein
below
1
g
to
be
left
off
the
nutrition
label
.
this
comment
requested
that
such
amounts
of
protein
be
declared
because
individuals
who
are
highly
sensitive
to
monosodium
glutamate
(
msg
)
may
have
adverse
reactions
.
fda
has
recognized
that
certain
individuals
are
sensitive
to
msg
and
believes
that
the
appropriate
means
to
convey
the
presence
of
this
ingredient
to
consumers
is
by
use
of
the
ingredient
statement
because
msg
is
a
food
ingredient
.
the
agency
reiterates
that
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
are
required
to
comply
with
§
1014
(
21
cfr
1014
,
which
requires
full
ingredient
labeling
of
food
.
furthermore
,
in
the
federal
register
of
01/06/1993
,
the
agency
proposed
changes
in
the
regulations
pertaining
to
ingredient
labeling
to
accommodate
those
individuals
who
are
sensitive
to
msg
.
proposed
§
101
22
(
58
fr
2950
)
would
require
that
when
the
amount
of
free
glutamate
in
hydrolyzed
protein
reaches
a
specified
level
,
the
declaration
in
the
ingredient
statement
must
include
the
parenthetical
`
contains
glutamate
'
the
agency
has
reexamined
proposed
§
101
36
in
response
to
this
comment
and
notes
that
there
is
an
inconsistency
in
the
labeling
of
protein
,
total
carbohydrate
,
and
dietary
fiber
between
§
1019
and
proposed
§
101
36
.
for
example
,
05
g
to
0
99
g
of
these
substances
in
a
dietary
supplement
of
a
vitamin
or
mineral
would
not
be
declared
under
proposed
§
101
36
,
yet
these
amounts
in
a
food
in
conventional
food
form
would
be
declared
either
as
`
1
g
'
or
`
less
than
1
g
'
under
§
1019c
.
to
correct
this
inconsistency
,
the
agency
is
modifying
§
101
36
)
to
provide
that
amounts
of
nutrients
that
can
be
declared
as
zero
in
the
nutrition
label
of
foods
in
conventional
food
form
shall
not
be
declared
in
the
nutrition
labeling
of
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
.
thus
,
the
agency
is
requiring
the
declaration
of
protein
,
as
well
as
total
carbohydrate
and
dietary
fiber
,
when
they
are
present
in
amounts
of
05
g
to
1
g
.
amounts
under
05
g
would
continue
to
not
be
listed
in
the
nutrition
label
of
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
,
because
these
amounts
would
allow
a
declaration
of
zero
in
the
nutrition
labeling
of
foods
in
conventional
form
.
15
.
one
comment
recommended
that
`
active
'
ingredients
present
at
less
than
2
percent
of
the
daily
value
be
allowed
to
be
listed
in
the
nutrition
label
.
the
agency
is
not
allowing
vitamins
and
minerals
(
except
sodium
and
potassium
,
which
are
not
included
in
§
1019c8iv
)
present
at
less
than
2
percent
of
the
daily
value
to
be
listed
because
the
declaration
of
such
amounts
would
be
misleading
.
such
values
are
insignificant
under
§
1019f
)
and
may
be
declared
as
0
percent
of
the
rdi
in
the
nutrition
labeling
of
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
they
are
amounts
that
are
dietetically
trivial
and
physiologically
inconsequential
.
in
addition
,
fda
is
concerned
that
some
consumers
will
be
misled
by
the
mere
presence
of
names
of
nutrients
within
the
nutrition
label
,
because
they
would
assume
that
products
with
more
nutrients
listed
have
a
greater
public
health
significance
than
those
with
less
,
regardless
of
the
amount
of
each
nutrient
present
.
the
agency
is
unaware
of
any
reason
,
nor
does
the
comment
present
any
reason
,
for
allowing
the
declaration
of
nutrients
that
are
present
in
such
small
amounts
.
thus
,
the
agency
is
making
no
change
in
response
to
this
comment
.
16
.
one
comment
requested
that
fda
revise
§
101

)
to
more
clearly
state
the
increments
to
be
used
for
expressing
the
quantitative
amounts
by
weight
of
vitamins
and
minerals
.
another
comment
stated
that
amounts
should
not
be
rounded
.
this
comment
stated
,
`
we
really
see
no

proposed
§
101
36
)
stated
that
amounts
of
vitamins
and
minerals
are
to
be
expressed
in
the
increments
specified
in
§
1019c

using
the
units
of

and
the
level
of

given
in
§
1019c8iv
,
except
that
zeros
following
decimal
points
may
be
dropped
.
while
the
agency
is
adopting
this
rule
,
fda
recognizes
that
,
as
the
comment
points
out
,
§
1019c
)
does
not
address
the
question
of
the
increments
in
which
the
quantitative
amounts
of
vitamins
and
minerals
are
to
be
declared
because
in
the
nutrition
labeling
of
foods
in
conventional
food
form
,
vitamins
,
and
minerals
are
declared
only
as
a
percentage
of
the
daily
value
.
the
quantitative
amounts
by
weight
of
these
nutrients
,
except
for
potassium
and
sodium
,
which
are
considered
electrolytes
,
are
not
required
in
the
nutrition
label
of
conventional
foods
.
the
agency
has
considered
this
issue
and
notes
that
dietary
supplements
,
unlike
most
foods
in
conventional
food
form
,
are
fabricated
to
contain
specific
amounts
of
vitamins
and
minerals
.
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
vitamins
and
minerals
in
dietary
supplements
are
categorized
as
class
i
nutrients
,
and
that
under
§
1019g4
,
a
food
is
misbranded
if
it
contains
less
of
an
added
vitamin
or
mineral
than
the
amount
declared
on
the
label
.
in
view
of
how
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
are
made
,
the
agency
agrees
that
it
makes
no
sense
to
permit
the
amounts
of
vitamins
and
minerals
in
such
products
to
be
rounded
and
declared
only
in
specified
increments
.
therefore
,
the
agency
has
modified
§
101
36
)
to
provide
that
the
actual
amounts
of
vitamins
and
minerals
in
the
supplement
are
to
be
declared
using
the
units
of
measure
specified
in
§
1019c8iv
,
except
that
zeros
following
decimal
points
may
be
dropped
.
with
respect
to
levels
of
significance
,
that
is
,
the
number
of
decimal
places
used
in
declaring
amounts
,
the
agency
proposed
that
only
the
levels
of
significance
shown
in
§
1019c8iv
)
could
be
presented
.
in
some
cases
,
however
,
the
number
of
decimal
places
allowed
is
not
sufficient
to
express
actual
amounts
of
certain
vitamins
and
minerals
because
the
amounts
are
very
small
.
for
example
,
a
product
that
contains
10
percent
of
the
daily
value
for
copper
would
contain
02
mg
of
copper
.
if
the
amount
of
copper
had
to
be
expressed
using
the
same
level
of
significance
as
that
used
in
§
1019c8iv
)
for
expressing
its
rdi
(
ie
,
2
mg
,
the
lowest
amount
that
could
be
declared
would
be
1
mg
,
which
would
be
inaccurately
high
.
to
ensure
that
amounts
of
vitamins
and
minerals
that
have
nutritional
significance
can
be
declared
,
the
agency
is
modifying
§
101
36
)
to
provide
that
amounts
shall
be
expressed
in
the
increments
specified
in
§
1019c
,
except
that
additional
levels
of
significance
may
be
used
when
the
number
of
decimal
places
indicated
is
not
sufficient
to
express
lower
amounts
(
eg
,
the
rdi
for
copper
is
given
in
whole
mg
,
but
the
quantitative
amount
may
be
declared
in
tenths
of
a
mg
.
additionally
,
the
agency
is
modifying
§
101
36
)
to
describe
how
amounts
of
the
nutrients
from

and
10th
editions

and
amounts
for

these
values
shall
be

as
discussed
in
the
nutrition

for

(

,
with
the
exception
of
calcium
and

fda
proposed
in

that
nutrients
declared
in

supplements
be
listed
in
the
order
that
nutrients
are
listed
in
the
nutrition
labeling
of
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
the
agency
proposed
that
calcium
and
iron
be
listed
after
the
listing
of
any
vitamins
that
are
present
so
that
all
of
the
vitamins
will
be
grouped
together
.
while
vitamin
a
and
vitamin
c
are
to
be
listed
first
,
consistent
with
§
1019c
,
they
are
then
followed
by
the
fatsoluble
fat
soluble
vitamins
,
then
the
watersoluble
water
soluble
vitamins
and
the
minerals
.
the
nas
in
its
rda
publications
has
traditionally
grouped
the
fatsoluble
fat
soluble
vitamins
ahead
of
the
watersoluble
water
soluble
vitamins
.
the
agency
notes
that
this
order
is
followed
on
the
labels
of
many
vitamin
supplements
in
the
marketplace
.
the
comment
requesting
alphabetical
order
gave
no
convincing
justification
for
following
a
different
order
,
and
,
thus
,
fda
is
not
changing
the
order
.
additionally
,
the
comment
requesting
that
calcium
and
magnesium
be
the
first
minerals
to
be
listed
presented
no
reason
for
the
agency
to
make
this
change
.
calcium
and
iron
are
required
to
be
the
first
minerals
listed
on
the

in
the
absence
of
any
reason
for
why
calcium
and
magnesium
should
be
the
first
minerals
to
be
declared
on
the
labels
of
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
,
the
agency
is
making
no
change
in
the
order
for
minerals
.

.
one
comment
requested
that
§

be
revised
to
require
that
potassium
be
listed
with
the
other
minerals
,
preferably
last
on
the
list
.
this
comment
and
others
expressed
confusion
about
whether
potassium
could
be
listed
and
requested
clarification
.
one
comment
requested
that
§
101
36
)
be
clarified
to
allow
for
the
voluntary
listing
of
potassium
in
dietary
supplements
because
,
according
to
the
comment
,
potassium
is
usually
present
at
less
than
100
mg
per
tablet
,
primarily
because
of
existing
fda
restrictions
on
potassium
salt
preparations
.
the
agency
agrees
that
the
listing
of
potassium
needs
clarification
.
potassium
is
not
required
to
be
listed
on
the
nutrition
label
of
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
however
,
it
can
be
listed
voluntarily
,
and
when
it
is
,
it
is
to
be
listed
under
sodium
,
as
an
electrolyte
rather
than
with
the
minerals
.
in
contrast
,
the
agency
proposed
that
potassium
be
required
to
be
listed
on
the
nutrition
label
of
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
when
present
in
supplements
at
more
than
insignificant
amounts
(
ie
,
5
mg
and
above
,
consistent
with
the
listing
of
other
vitamins
and
minerals
.
the
agency
knows
of
no
reason
why
potassium
in
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
should
be
treated
differently
from
other
vitamins
and
minerals
in
these
products
,
and
the
comment
did
not
provide
a
reason
for
why
the
listing
of
potassium
should
be
voluntary
rather
than
mandatory
.
therefore
,
the
agency
is
not
making
this
change
.
however
,
the
agency
is
modifying
the
language
of
§
101
36
)
to
make
it
clear
that
the
declaration
of
potassium
is
required
when
it
is
present
at
more
than
insignificant
amounts
.
to
this
end
,
fda
has
revised
the
second
sentence
of
§
101
36
)
to
state
:
`
in
addition
,
potassium
*
*
*
*
*
*
shall
be
declared
,
except
when
present
at
an
amount
that
allows
a
declaration
of
zero
*
*
*
*
*
.
'
'
with
respect
to
the
placement
of
potassium
within
the
nutrition
label
,
fda
agrees
with
the
comment
that
the
regulation
should
be
modified
.
the
proposal
stated
that
nutrients
that
are
present
shall
be
listed
in
the
order
specified
in
§
1019c
,
which
would
mean
that
potassium
,
as
well
as
sodium
,
would
precede
the
listing
of
any
other
vitamins
or
minerals
present
in
a
supplement
.
fda
has
concluded
that
it
is
not
appropriate
and
might
confuse
consumers
to
have
the
declaration
of
potassium
,
as
well
as
that
of
sodium
,
precede
the
declaration
of
other
vitamins
and
minerals
on
these
labels
because
traditionally
vitamins
have
appeared
first
.
the
agency
agrees
with
the
comment
that
it
is
appropriate
for
potassium
to
be
listed
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
because
it
is
an
electrolyte
,
and
the
electrolyte
,
chloride
,
is
listed
at
the
bottom
.
for
the
same
reason
,
the
agency
concludes
that
sodium
should
be
listed
with
the
other
electrolytes
.
accordingly
,
the
agency
is
revising
§
101
36
)
to
state
that
sodium
and
potassium
should
be
listed
,
in
that
order
,
following
the
electrolyte
chloride
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
of
minerals
.

one
comment
requested
clarification
regarding
the
labeling
to
be
used
on
a
package
that
has
two
compartments
,
each
containing
a
different
supplement
to
be
taken
at
the
same
time
,
three
times
daily
with
meals
.
the
company
asked
if
the
regulations
permit
the
information
for
both
supplements
to
be
reported
aggregately
in
one
nutrition
label
that
has
one
column
of
names
and
amounts
and
one
column
of
percent
daily
values
.
the
firm
requested
that
if
an
aggregate
label
is
not
permitted
,
the
additional
nutrition
label
be
permitted
in
a
package
insert
.
the
company
also
asked
how
the
information
should
be
presented
if
children
one
to
four
years
of
age
are
to
take
the
same
amount
as
adults
,
and
how
it
is
to
be
presented
if
such
children
are
to
take
half
the
amount
of
adults
.
the
agency
advises
that
if
two
supplements
are
to
be
taken
at
the
same
time
,
one
unit
of
each
three
times
daily
,
the
nutrition
information
for
both
supplements
must
be
reported
aggregately
.
in
this
situation
,
the
serving
size
must
clearly
state
that
a
serving
includes
one
of
each
supplement
,
with
one
column
listing
names
and
the
total
quantitative
amount
by
weight
for
both
supplements
and
another
column
containing
the
total
percent
daily
values
.
if
this
product
is
also
represented
for
use
by
children
one
to
four
years
of
age
,
the
percent
daily
values
for
this
age
group
would
have
to
be
presented
in
a
third
column
.
in
the
case
where
the
serving
size
is
different
for
children
,
a
nutrition
label
for
adults
and
a
separate
nutrition
label
for
children
must
be
used
to
avoid
confusion
.

a
few
comments
requested
that
the
declaration
of
the
percent
of
vitamin
a
present
as
beta
-
carotene
be
mandatory
.
these
comments
argued
that
this
information
is
needed
to
help
consumers
compare
the
amounts
of
beta
-
carotene
in
various
products
.
they
stated
that
this
information
would
help
consumers
understand
claims
such
as
`
now
with
beta
-
carotene
'
one
of
these
comments
requested
the
voluntary
declaration
of
the
quantitative
amount
of
beta
-
carotene
in
addition
to
the
percentage
of
vitamin
a
present
as
beta
-
carotene
.
this
comment
stated
that
calculations
of
vitamin
a
and
beta
-
carotene
values
are
difficult
even
for
scientists
,
and
that
merely
providing
a
percentage
will
not
allow
consumers
to
readily
determine
just
how
much
beta
-
carotene
is
present
in
the
product
.
the
comment
requested
that
the
amount
of
beta
-
carotene
be
expressed
in
mg
.
two
comments
requested
that
the
percent
of
vitamin
a
present
as
retinol
also
be
mandatory
.
one
of
these
comments
explained
that
most
people
are
better
off
getting
their
vitamin
a
from
beta
-
carotene
rather
than
from
retinol
because
beta
-
carotene
is
safer
in
high
doses
and
may
help
reduce
the
risk
of
certain
cancers
,
heart
disease
,
cataracts
,
and
other
health
problems
.
fda
is
not
persuaded
that
the
declaration
of
the
percent
of
vitamin
a
present
as
beta
-
carotene
should
be
mandatory
because
quantitative
recommendations
about
the
intake
of
beta
-
carotene
have
not
yet
been
established
by
the
scientific
community
.
in
the
07/19/1990
,
mandatory
nutrition
labeling
proposal
(
55
fr
29476
at
29493
,
the
agency
set
out
the
factors
that
it
considered
in
deciding
whether
a
nutrient
or
food
component
should
be
mandatory
or
voluntary
in
nutrition
labeling
:
the
agency
has
proposed
to
make
the
declaration
of
a
nutrient
or
food
component
mandatory
in
nutrition
labeling
when
quantitative
intake
recommendations
with
respect
to
the
nutrient
or
component
are
highlighted
in
the
reports
*
*
*
*
*
*
(
eg
,
`
reduce
total
fat
intake
to
30
%
or
less
of
calories
'
*
*
*
*
*
,
and
the
nutrient
or
component
is
of
particular
public
health
significance
as
defined
in
several
recent
consensus
documents
*
*
*
*
*
.
on
the
other
hand
,
for
those
nutrients
or
food
components
for
which
quantitative
intake
recommendations
are
not
highlighted
but
that
do
have
some
public
health
significance
*
*
*
*
*
,
or
for
which
quantitative
recommendations
are
available
but
that
are
not
of
pressing
public
health
importance
(
eg
,
the
recommended
dietary
allowances
for
several
vitamins
and
minerals
*
*
*
*
*
,
the
agency
is
proposing
to
make
declaration
of
the
nutrient
or
component
voluntary
.
(
55
fr
29487
at
29493
)
the
agency
concludes
that
its
decision
to
have
the
percent
of
vitamin
a
present
as
beta
-
carotene
be
voluntary
is
consistent
with
these
guidelines
because
quantitative
intake
recommendations
have
not
been
established
.
on
the
other
hand
,
if
a
claim
about
beta
-
carotene
is
made
,
information
on
the
percent
of
vitamin
a
present
as
beta
-
carotene
is
needed
to
help
consumers
to
understand
the
claim
.
therefore
,
the
agency
is
modifying
§
101
36
)
to
require
declaration
of
the
percent
of
vitamin
a
present
as
beta
-
carotene
when
a
claim
is
made
about
beta
-
carotene
.
the
agency
tentatively
concludes
that
a
parallel
change
in
§
1019c8vi
)
for
the
labels
of
foods
in
conventional
food
form
is
appropriate
.
the
agency
intends
to
propose
this
change
in
the
near
future
.
the
agency
is
accepting
the
comments
suggestion
to
provide
that
when
the
percent
of
vitamin
a
present
as
beta
-
carotene
is
declared
,
the
quantitative
amount
of
beta
-
carotene
may
also
be
declared
voluntarily
.
the
agency
is
persuaded
by
the
comment
that
this
information
on
the
labels
of
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
would
be
useful
to
those
individuals
who
are
interested
in
maintaining
a
certain
quantitative
intake
of
beta
-
carotene
in
their
diets
.
the
agency
notes
that
the
comment
requested
that
the
amount
of
beta
-
carotene
be
declared
in
terms
of
mg
.
however
,
the
agency
is
requiring
that
international
units
(
iu
)
be
used
in
place
of
mg
to
be
consistent
with
the
declaration
of
vitamin
a
.
fda
finds
the
usefulness
of
this
added
information
would
be
reduced
if
the
units
used
to
quantify
vitamin
a
and
beta
-
carotene
levels
differ
.
accordingly
,
the
agency
is
amending
§
101
36
)
to
provide
that
when
the
percent
of
vitamin
a
present
as
beta
-
carotene
is
declared
,
the
quantitative
amount
in
terms
of
iu
may
also
be
declared
,
eg
,
`
vitamin
a
5000
iu
(
90
percent
(
4500
iu
)
as
beta
-
carotene
.
the
agency
intends
to
propose
a
parallel
change
in
§
1019c8vi
)
as
soon
as
possible
.
until
the
agency
does
so
,
the
agency
advises
that
it
is
unlikely
that
it
will
take
enforcement
action
against
foods
regulated
under
§
1019
that
declare
beta
-
carotene
in
a
manner
consistent
with
§
101
36
)
as
long
as
they
comply
with
§
1019
in
all
other
respects
.
additionally
,
the
provision
on
type
size
requirements
for
the
added
statement
on
beta
-
carotene
in
§
101
36
)
is
corrected
to
refer
to
paragraph
(
b3iv
)
instead
of
to
(
b3ii
.
there
was
an
inadvertent
error
in
this
reference
in
the
proposal
.
with
respect
to
retinol
,
the
agency
concludes
that
,
in
accordance
with
the
guidelines
set
out
above
,
the
declaration
of
retinol
should
be
neither
mandatory
nor
voluntary
because
of
the
absence
of
quantitative
intake
recommendations
and
of
public
health
significance
.
thus
,
the
agency
is
not
changing
the
proposed
rule
to
provide
for
the
inclusion
of
retinol
in
the
nutrition
label
.

one
comment
requested
that
§
101
36
)
be
revised
to
`
permit
common
synonyms
'
instead
of
only
the
synonyms
specified
.
this
comment
stated
that
allowing
all
synonyms
would
provide
people
with
more
information
and
would
ensure
that
the
contents
of
products
were
,
in
fact
,
comprehensible
to
more
people
.
the
comment
mentioned
,
for
example
,
that
niacin
is
known
by
many
as
vitamin
b3
and
vitamin
e
by
the
name
alphatocopherol
alpha
tocopherol
.
another
comment
expressed
support
for
restricting
the
use
of
synonyms
to
the
ones
allowed
in
the
proposed
rule

the
agency

that
the
provision
on

should
be
revised
to
`
permit
common
synonyms
'
instead
of
only
the

the
terminology
that
the

has
recognized
is
that
which
is
used
in

these
include

.
the
agency
has
restricted
the
use
of
synonyms
to
simplify
nutrition
labeling
and
to
avoid
potential
confusion
among
consumers
.
the
agency
believes
that
allowing
the
unrestricted
use
of
other
synonyms
will
contribute
to
confusion
about
the
nutrients
that
are
present
in
the
product
.
it
will
also
make
product
comparisons
more
difficult
because
of
the
absence
of
consistent
terminology
.
therefore
,
fda
is
not
making
the
change
requested
by
the
comment
.
23
.
at
least
one
comment
requested
that
the
nutrition
label
of
vitamins
with
iron
,
for
example
,
be
allowed
to
highlight
the
listing
of
iron
.
the
comment
stated
that
such
highlighting
is
a
useful
and
necessary
tool
to
differentiate
various
product
lines
.
the
agency
is
not
persuaded
that
the
highlighting
of
iron
in
the
example
described
in
the
comment
is
necessary
for
consumers
to
differentiate
between
various
product
lines
because
the
name
,
or
statement
of
identity
,
of
the
product
must
identify
the
product
as
a
multivitamin
with
iron
.
this
identification
is
sufficient
to
differentiate
the
product
from
other
multivitamin
products
.
as
discussed
in
the
mandatory
nutrition
labeling
final
rule
(
58
fr
2079
at
2138
,
fda
is
not
permitting
highlighting
of
this
type
because
it
can
be
used
inconsistently
in
a
way
that
would
be
potentially
misleading
to
consumers
.
among
products
with
similar
nutrition
profiles
,
some
would
highlight
certain
nutrients
and
others
would
not
.
consumers
could
not
depend
on
the
fact
that
all
labels
of
similar
products
would
look
the
same
,
and
the
differences
in
highlighting
could
undermine
the
credibility
of
the
information
on
the
nutrition
label
and
lead
to
consumer
confusion
.
accordingly
,
the
agency
is
not
providing
for
the
highlighting
requested
by
the
comment
.
24
.
a
number
of
comments
suggested
that
the
source
of
a
vitamin
or
mineral
be
included
in
the
nutrition
label
immediately
following
the
listing
of
that
vitamin
or
mineral
,
in
a
manner
similar
to
the
allowed
listing
of
beta
-
carotene
as
a
source
of
vitamin
a
.
one
comment
stated
that
this
information
should
be
listed
in
a
separate
column
entitled
`
source
'
one
comment
requested
that
the
source
information
should
at
least
be
optional
.
the
comments
stated
that
if
this
suggestion
is
adopted
,
it
will
be
unnecessary
to
repeat
source
information
in
the
ingredient
statement
,
and
one
comment
requested
that
the
regulations
on
ingredient
labeling
be
revised
accordingly
.
the
comments
said
that
this
approach
would
conserve
space
and
more
effectively
communicate
source
information
to
consumers
.
the
agency
notes
that
the
parenthetical
listing
of
the
source
of
a
vitamin
or
mineral
in
the
nutrition
label
is
a
common
practice
by
some
,
but
not
all
,
manufacturers
in
the
dietary
supplement
industry
.
the
agency
finds
,
however
,
that
the
comments
submitted
failed
to
provide
adequate
justification
and
supporting
information
demonstrating
that
adoption
,
on
an
industrywide
industry
wide
basis
,
of
this
manner
of
expressing
nutrition
and
ingredient
information
would
result
in
a
nutrition
label
that
is
readily
observable
and
comprehensible
,
as
required
by
the
act
.
comments
have
not
demonstrated
that
consumers
will
be
able
to
distinguish
and
understand
the
meaning
of
both
the
nutrition
and
ingredient
information
provided
.
fda
has
no
means
on
which
to
determine
,
for
example
,
whether
the
name
of
the
source
of
the
nutrient
is
indeed
that
and
not
the
chemical
name
of
the
nutrient
.
the
comments
also
failed
to
provide
data
to
demonstrate
that
this
manner
of
presentation
truly
conserves
label
space
,
especially
if
additional
columns
are
added
to
the
nutrition
label
.
further
,
if
as
suggested
by
one
comment
,
source
information
within
the
nutrition
label
were
made
optional
,
the
consistency
of
presentation
of
information
that
has
been
a
guiding
principle
of
the
agency
throughout
the
food
label
reform
efforts
would
be
violated
.
accordingly
,
the
agency
is
not
providing
for
the
parenthetical
listing
of
nutrient
source
within
the
nutrition
label
.
the
agency
advises
,
however
,
that
it
would
be
receptive
to
a
adequately
supported
petition
on
this
issue
,
and
that
it
will
act
expeditiously
on
such
petition
.
given
that
,
elsewhere
in
this
issue
of
the
federal
register
,
,
the
agency
is
establishing
a
date
of
applicability
of
07/01/1995
,
for
the
regulation
governing
nutrition
labeling
of
dietary
supplements
,
if
a
petition
is
promptly
submitted
,
that
petition
could
be
acted
upon
before
the
date
of
applicability
.
any
petition
submitted
to
permit
source
declaration
within
the
nutrition
label
would
have
to
address
,
in
detail
,
at
least
the
issues
of
how
the
source
information
is
to
be
consistently
and
clearly
expressed
,
and
why
this
manner
of
expression
is
advantageous
to
the
consumer
.
because
a
primary
purpose
of
the
nutrition
label
is
to
allow
consumers
to
compare
the
nutrition
profile
of
products
at
the
point
of
purchase
,
it
is
imperative
that
there
be
a
high
degree
of
consistency
in
the
presentation
of
nutrition
information
for
all
dietary
supplements
.
fda
would
also
need
information
on
precisely
how
source
information
should
be
expressed
within
the
nutrition
label
.
for
example
,
how
would
the
source
information
be
expressed
if
a
single
ingredient
(
eg
,
fish
liver
oil
)
is
a
source
of
a
number
of
nutrients
(
eg
,
vitamins
a
and
d
)
within
a
dietary
supplement
?
if
the
source
is
required
to
be
listed
multiple
times
,
how
does
this
conserve
label
space
?
also
,
would
multiple
listing
of
a
source
mislead
consumers
about
the
amount
of
the
ingredient
in
the
food
?
conversely
,
if
a
nutrient
in
a
supplement
is
provided
from
several
sources
(
eg
,
iodine
from
kelp
and
potassium
iodide
,
how
would
this
information
be
clearly
and
consistently
conveyed
?
would
the
source
listed
be
all
sources
,
or
only
the
primary
source
,
of
the
nutrient
?
if
source
listing
in
the
nutrition
label
were
to
be
limited
to
the
primary
source
,
how
would
the
primary
source
be
determined
?
are
safeguards
necessary
to
ensure
that
consumers
are
not
misled
by
inappropriate
emphasis
on
certain
sources
of
nutrients
?
for
example
,
how
would
consumers
be
fully
informed
and
be
protected
from
being
misled
if
a
nutrient
is
derived
from
more
than
one
source
,
and
only
the
primary
source
is
listed
,
particularly
if
a
valued
ingredient
provides
some
,
but
not
all
,
of
the
nutrient
in
question
?
should
source
information
be
permitted
in
the
nutrition
label
only
when
there
is
some
significance
to
the
source
?
for
example
,
because
there
are
potential
safety
concerns
about
high
intakes
of
vitamin
a
from
some
other
sources
,
fda
found
that
there
is
was
a
public
health
reason
for
permitting
beta
-
carotene
to
be
shown
as
a
source
of
vitamin
a
.
should
such
a
finding
be
a
prerequisite
for
permitting
source
labeling
?
if
source
labeling
is
limited
to
cases
in
which
the
source
is
significant
(
eg
,
particularly
valued
sources
,
concern
about
other
potential
sources
,
how
should
such
significance
be
consistently
determined
?
also
,
any
petition
on
source
labeling
in
the
nutrition
label
should
address
the
issue
of
clarity
of
presentation
.
section
2b1a
)
of
the
1990
amendments
states
that
the
nutrition
information
should
be
readily
observable
and
comprehensible
.
would
adding
information
about
the
source
of
nutrients
detract
from
the
comprehensibility
of
the
nutrition
label
?
given
that
source
information
will
be
available
in
the
ingredient
statement
,
would
source
declarations
unnecessarily
burden
the
nutrition
label
and
detract
from
its
primary
purpose
of
providing
a
nutrient
profile
of
the
product
?
would
it
be
more
difficult
for
consumers
to
find
the
listing
of
the
quantitative
amounts
by
weight
of
nutrients
in
the
nutrition
label
when
source
information
is
given
?
petitions
on
this
issue
would
be
strengthened
by
the
inclusion
of
consumer
survey
or
other
similar
data
showing
that
consumers
readily
observe
and
comprehend
information
presented
in
the
manner
suggested
by
the
comments
.
as
discussed
in
the
mandatory
labeling
final
rule
(
58
fr
2079
at
2170
,
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
,
like
other
foods
,
are
required
to
bear
a
complete
list
of
ingredients
.
under
section
403i2
)
of
the
act
,
the
statement
of
ingredients
must
list
all
ingredients
of
these
foods
,
including
,
,
for
example
,
lactose
and
other
fillers
,
artificial
colors
,
flavors
,
binders
,
and
excipients
,
as
well
as
the
source
of
the
vitamins
and
minerals
in
the
dietary
supplement
.
this
section
of
the
act
provides
fda
with
authority
to
grant
exemptions
from
the
ingredient
listing
requirements
,
but
such
exemptions
have
not
been
sought
by
the
dietary
supplement
industry
.
the
agency
advises
that
the
fact
that
the
name
of
an
ingredient
appears
elsewhere
on
the
label
is
not
,
in
and
of
itself
,
sufficient
justification
to
grant
such
exemptions
.
therefore
,
any
petition
on
this
subject
must
address
the
issue
of
how
this
manner
of
presentation
of
the
source
of
nutrients
continues
to
fulfill
the
primary
purpose
of
the
ingredient
label
to
adequately
inform
consumers
about
all
ingredients
used
to
make
a
food
,
including
those
that
might
be
of
concern
because
of
personal
health
reasons
(
eg
,
lactose
.
the
agency
advises
that
its
current
policy
,
as
stated
in
the
federal
register
of
08/02/1973
(
38
fr
20730
)
and
03/16/1979
(
44
fr
16005
,
and
in
subsequent
correspondence
with
industry
(
refs
.
6
and
7
,
is
that
the
label
for
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
must
contain
a
list
of
nutrients
and
a
separate
full
statement
of
ingredients
,
except
those
exempted
by
section
403i2
)
of
the
act
,
declared
by
their
common
or
usual
name
.
this
policy
is
consistent
with
the
ingredient
declaration
requirements
for
other
types
of
products
.
therefore
,
for
all
the
reasons
cited
above
,
fda
has
decided
not
to
take
the
action
requested
by
these
comments
,
pending
receipt
and
review
of
petitions
on
this

listing
of

.
the
agency
received
a
number
of
comments
that
opposed
the
use
of
the
term
`
percent
daily
value
'
and
that
stated
that
they
preferred
to
continue
to
use
the
term
`
percent
us
.
rda
'
the
agency
disagrees
with
these
comments
.
as
explained
in
the
final
rule
on
rdis
that
published
in
the
federal
register
of
01/06/1993
(
58
fr
2206
at
2207
and
2208
,
the
agency
has
established
two
sets
of
label
references
values
(
ie
,
rdis
,
which
were
previously
the
us
.
rdas
,
and
drvs
.
because
the
agency
believed
the
use
of
the
two
terms
on
food
labels
could
be
confusing
to
consumers
,
it
established
a
single
term
,
`
daily
value
'
to
refer
to
both
the
rdis
and
drvs
(
58
fr
2079
at
2124
.
the
comments
did
not
provide
any
new
arguments
or
data
that
were
not
considered
in
that
rulemaking
.
furthermore
,
the
agency
advises
that
it
knows
of
no
reason
why
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
should
not
use
the
terminology
prescribed
for
foods
in
general
.
consistency
in
terminology
will
assist
consumers
in
maintaining
healthy
dietary
practices
by
facilitating
their
use
of
the
nutrition
label
to
construct
a
healthy
diet
that
includes
both
dietary
supplements
and
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
therefore
,
the
agency
is
not
making
any
change
in
the
regulations
in
response
to
these
comments
.
26
.
one
comment
requested
that
the
agency
eliminate
the
use
of
the
term
`
rdi
'
and
use
the
term
`
drv
'
for
both
macronutrients
and
micronutrients
.
the
comment
stated
that
it
is
confusing
to
have
more
the
one
term
.
the
comment
appears
to
be
requesting
new
terms
not
only
for
the
nutrition
label
of
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
but
also
for
the
nutrition
label
of
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
the
terms
`
rdi
'
and
`
drv
'
were
established
in
the
final
rule
on
rdis
(
58
fr
2206
.
as
discussed
in
the
proposed
rule
of
07/19/1990
(
55
fr
29476
at
29479
,
the
distinction
between
the
rdis
and
drvs
is
necessary
for
several
reasons
.
first
,
the
rdis
are
based
on
the
rdas
,
which
are
considered
intake
levels
to
be
achieved
.
however
,
while
some
drvs
are
based
on
recommendations
to
increase
or
maintain
intake
of
the
particular
food
component
,
other
drvs
reflect
levels
that
are
limitations
on
intake
.
furthermore
,
many
of
the
drvs
must
be
based
on
a
specific
caloric
intake
,
and
,
unlike
the
rdis
,
the
drvs
are
not
relevant
for
infants
and
young
children
.
finally
,
the
rdis
serve
as
criteria
for
use
in
several
regulatory
functions
,
such
as
the
application
of
the
agencys
food
fortification
policy
and
the
assessment
of
the
nutritional
equivalency
of
imitation
foods
.
the
drvs
do
not
have
such
uses
.
therefore
,
fda
believes
that
it
is
appropriate
to
treat
rdis
and
drvs
as
two
different
sets
of
reference
values
.
however
,
the
agency
notes
that
both
terms
are
referred
to
as
`
daily
values
'
on
the
nutrition
label
.
the
agency
believes
that
the
use
of
a
single
term
on
the
label
will
limit
consumer
confusion
.
thus
,
the
concern
articulated
by
the
comment
is
fully
addressed
by
fdas
current
regulatory
scheme
.
accordingly
,
the
agency
is
not
making
the
requested
change
.
27
.
one
comment
requested
that
products
containing
5
to
17
mg
of
potassium
should
be
allowed
to
state
,
`
contains
less
than
1
percent
of
the
daily
value
of
this
nutrient
'
the
comment
explained
that
17
mg
of
potassium
expressed
to
the
nearest
whole
percent
comes
to
`
0
percent
daily
value
'
(
3500
mg
divided
by
17
,
which
rounds
to
zero
,
yet
§
1019c5
)
only
allows
amounts
less
than
5
mg
to
be
considered
as
zero
.
as
a
result
,
the
nutrition
label
of
such
a
product
would
state
15
mg
potassium
and
0
percent
daily
value
.
the
comment
expressed
concern
that
such
apparently
contradictory
statements
would
be
confusing
to
consumers
.
the
comment
identifies
a
concern
applicable
to
dietary
supplements
and
foods
in
conventional
food
form
,
namely
that
consumers
may
find
it
confusing
when
there
is
a
quantitative
amount
by
weight
for
a
nutrient
,
and
yet
the
percent
daily
value
states
0
percent
.
this
seeming
conflict
can
occur
with
sodium
,
potassium
,
and
total
carbohydrate
on
labels
of
both
supplements
and
foods
in
conventional
food
form
,
and
with
some
vitamins
and
minerals
in
dietary
supplements
,
when
both
quantitative
amounts
by
weight
and
percent
daily
values
are
given
.
to
avoid
any
possible
confusion
that
these
apparently
inconsistent
declarations
may
cause
,
the
agency
is
modifying
§
101
36
)
to
provide
for
the
declaration
of
`
less
than
1
'
in
the
percent
of
daily
value
column
when
the
declaration
of
the
quantitative
amount
by
weight
is
greater
than
zero
,
and
the
calculation
of
percent
daily
value
yields
a
value
that
is
less
than
1
percent
.
the
agency
believes
that
a
parallel
change
in
§
1019d7ii
)
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
is
appropriate
.
the
agency
intends
to
propose
this
change
in
the
near
future
.
additionally
,
the
agency
notes
that
,
consistent
with
§
1019d7ii
,
as
modified
in
the
technical
amendments
(
58
fr
44063
at
44077
,
08/18/1993
,
it
is
modifying
§
101
36
)
to
specify
that
the
percent
of
daily
value
shall
be
calculated
by
dividing
either
the
amount
declared
on
the
label
for
each
nutrient
or
the
actual
amount
of
each
nutrient
(
ie
,
before
rounding
)
by
the
rdi
or
drv
for
the
specified
nutrient
and
multiplying
by
100
.
the
agency
is
making
this
change
to
provide
for
consistency
on
the
food
label
between
the
percent
daily
value
and
the
quantitative
amount
by
weight
.
the
agency
had
previously
provided
only
that
the
amount
declared
be
used
in
the
calculation
.

one
comment
requested
clarification
of
§
101
36
,
which
provides
that
when
a
product
is
represented
or
purports
to
be
for
use
by
a
group
other
than
adults
and
children
older
than
4
years
of
age
,
the
percent
daily
value
for
each
group
must
be
presented
in
separate
columns
.
the
comment
asked
if
the
label
of
a
product
represented
for
use
`
for
the
family
'
would
have
to
include
information
for
all
of
the
groups
for
which
fda
has
established
rdis
.
the
agency
believes
that
it
is
appropriate
for
the
label
of
a
product
represented
for
use
`
for
the
family
'
to
include
information
for
adults
and
children
older
than
4
years
of
age
and
for
children
younger
than
4
years
of
age
because
families
often
include
children
in
this
age
group
.
inasmuch
as
there
generally
would
be
safety
concerns
in
feeding
infants
supplements
intended
for
use
by
adults
,
fda
also
advises
that
the
statement
`
for
the
family
'
should
be
modified
to
specifically
exclude
infants
if
a
firm
wants
to
include
only
a
single
list
of
rdi
values
.
the
agency
does
not
believe
that
this
comment
requires
any
change
in
the
language
of
the
proposed
rule
.
however
,
the
agency
advises
that
for
clarity
,
it
has
changed
the
word
`
additional
'
in
§
101
36
)
to
`
separate
'

.
one
comment
requested
that
the
first
sentence
in
§

,
`
the

be
revised
to
use
the
term
`

instead
of
`

'
the
comment
stated
that
the
`
nutrition
label
'
could
be
interpreted
to
mean
the
whole
label
,
in
which
case
the
phrase
`
nutrition
facts
'
would
have
to
be
the
biggest
print
on
the
label
.
the
agency
is
not
persuaded
that
this
revision
is
needed
.
in
proposed
§
101
36
and
in
§
1019
,
the
agency
has
consistently
used
the
term
`
nutrition

'
to
refer
to
the
nutrition
information
set
off
in
a
box
presented
under
the
heading
of
`
nutrition
facts
'
extensive
changes
would
be
required
in
both
regulations
to
make
consistent
changes
wherever
the
term
`
nutrition
label
'
is
used
.
because
no
other
comments
indicated
a
similar
concern
,
the
agency
is
not
making
the
requested
change
.
30
.
one
comment
requested
that
§
101
36
be
revised
to
clarify
that
selective
reverse
printing
may
not
be
used
as
a
form
of
highlighting
,
consistent
with
§
1019d1iv
.
the
agency
agrees
with
this
comment
.
it
unintentionally
failed
to
address
reverse
printing
in
§
101
36
.
in
the
nutrition
labeling
final
rule
,
fda
decided
not
to
permit
reverse
printing
as
a
form
of
highlighting
because
it
would
interfere
with
the
`
consistent
'
look
of
the
label
(
56
fr
2079
at
2138
.
for
the
same
reason
,
the
agency
is
not
permitting
reverse
printing
on
the
nutrition
labels
of
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
or
minerals
.
accordingly
,
the
agency
has
revised
the
second
sentence
of
§
101
36
)
to
read
`
the
title
and
all
headings
shall
be
highlighted
(
reverse

distinguish
them
from

one
comment
stated
that

multivitamin
multimineral
supplements
that
have
a
total
surface
area
available
to
bear
labeling
of
10
or
less
square
inches
should
be
exempt
from
the
requirement
in
§

that
all
information
within
the
nutrition
label
shall
have
at
least
one
point
leading
(
ie
,
space
between
two
lines
of
text
.
other
comments
stated
that
this
provision
of
the
proposed
rule
is
appropriate
.
the
agency
is
not
persuaded
that
the
nutrition
label
on
small
labels
should
be
exempt
from
the
requirement
of
at
least
one
point
leading
.
this
requirement
is
much
less
than
that
required
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
(
eg
,
four
point
is
required
between
nutrients
in
§
1019d1iic
)
and
does
little
more
than
insure
that
lines
of
text
do

as
discussed
in
the
nutrition
labeling
proposal
for
dietary
supplements
(

at

,
the
agency
proposed
at
least
one
point
leading
because
of
concerns
about
legibility
.
to
maintain
a
consistent
and
distinctive
format
that
is
legible
,
some
leading
is
necessary
.
accordingly
,
fda
is
providing
for
the
minimal
leading
of
one
point
in
the
nutrition
labeling
of
dietary
supplement
of
vitamins
and
minerals
and
encourages
manufacturers
to
use
more
leading
whenever
possible
.
fda
is
not
making
a
similar
change
for
dietary
supplements
of
herbs
and
of
other
similar
nutritional
substances
because
comments
did
not
demonstrate
space
concerns
with
those
products
that
would
justify
such
a
change
.
many
of
the
changes
in
this
document
will
help
reduce
space
requirements
(
eg
,
type
size
changes
.
if
a
manufacturer
finds
that
it
is
still
technologically
infeasible
or
impracticable
to
fit
the
nutrition
label
on
a
particular
package
,
it
may
write
to
the
office
of
food
labeling
as
provided
in
§
101

.

.
one
comment
requested
that
the
kerning
requirements
be
deleted
,
and
that
instead
,
the
regulation
state
that
`
letters
should
never
touch
'
consistent
with
the
technical
amendments
to
§
1019
published
on
08/18/1993
(
58
fr

.
another
comment
requested
that
labels
that
are
less
than
10
square
inches
should
be
exempt
from
the
requirement
in
proposed
§
101
36
)
that
all
information
within
the
nutrition
label
shall
have
type
that
is
kerned
(
ie
,
has
proximity
of
placement
)
no
tighter
than
-
4
setting
.
at
least
one
comment
supported
this
provision
of
the
proposed
rule
.
the
agency
agrees
that
the
kerning
requirements
should
be
made
consistent
with
that
for
the
nutrition
labels
on
packages
of
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
as
pointed
out
in
a
similar
comment
with
respect
to
the
labeling
of
foods
in
conventional
food
form
(
58
fr
44063
at
44065
,
a
numeric
kerning
value
(
which
in
effect
limits
the
proximity
of
one
letter
to
another
)
has
meaning
only
for
a
particular
type
setting
system
.
each
such
system
has
a
unique
numeric
scale
,
and
,
as
a
result
,
a
setting
of
-
4
is
meaningless
for
systems
other
than
the
one
that
fda
used
in
designing
its
sample
labels
.
the
agency
acknowledges
its
error
in
including
a
single
kerning
limit
that
would
be
required
for
all
type
setting
systems
.
accordingly
,
fda
is
revising
§
101
36
,
consistent
with
§
1019d1iid
,
to
delete
the
requirement
for
a
-
4
setting
and
to
state
that
letters
should
never
touch
.

.
a
couple
of
comments
supported
the
provision
in
proposed
§
101
36
)
regarding
type
size
,
but
more
than
ten
comments
strongly
opposed
the
provision
.
the
agency
proposed
to
require
type
size
no
smaller
than
8
point
for
nutrient
information
within
the
nutrition
label
and
to
allow
no
smaller
than
6
point
type
for
column
headings
and
footnotes
.
in
addition
,
the
agency
proposed
to
allow
no
smaller
than
6
point
type
for
all
of
the
information
within
the
nutrition
label
of
packages
having
a
total
surface
area
available
to
bear
labeling
of
40
or
less
square
inches
.
the
comments
said
that
the
total
surface
area
available
for
labeling
for
most
dietary
supplements
is
well
under
40
square
inches
.
they
stated
that
the
proposed
6
point
minimum
type
size
is
far
too
large
for
many
labels
to
include
all
of
the
required
nutrition
information
and
to
still
allow
space
for
the
ingredient
statement
,
necessary
product
codes
,
lot
number
,
expiration
dates
,
universal
product
code
(
upc
)
symbols
,
front
panel
copy
,
and
other
information
commonly
provided
on
dietary
supplement
labels
.
to
alleviate
this
space
problem
,
a
number
of
comments
requested
that
fda
allow
smaller
type
size
.
one
comment
requested
a
minimum
type
size
of
3
point
and
another
4
point
.
however
,
most
of
the
comments
suggested
a
minimum
type
size
of
45
point
,
which
they
said
is
consistent
with
the
nonprescription
drug
manufacturers
association
(
ndma
)
label
readability
guidelines
used
for
overthecounter
the
counter
(
otc
)
drugs
.
the
comments
were
divided
about
when
fda
should
allow
smaller
print
size
.
a
few
comments
believed
that
smaller
type
is
needed
on
labels
having
up
to
40
square
inches
of
total
surface
area
.
other
comments
suggested
that
such
type
is
necessary
on
varioussized
various
sized
labels
,
such
as
those
with
surface
areas
of
less
than
25
,
15
,
12
,
and
10
square
inches
.
finally
,
a
few
comments
suggested
that
the
regulation
should
state
that
type
size
should
be
`
as
large
as
possible
'
or
that
it
should
permit
manufacturers
to
decide
for
themselves
.
after
reviewing
many
dietary
supplement
labels
,
the
agency
is
persuaded
that
the
6
point
minimum
type
size
proposed
for
nutrition
labeling
information
is
too
large
for
many
multivitamin
and
multimineral
supplement
labels
.
the
agency
acknowledges
that
these
products
often
have
many
nutrients
to
declare
in
the
nutrition
label
,
are
often
sold
in
relatively
small
packages
jars
,
and
include
on
the
label
other
information
not
required
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
therefore
,
fda
is
accepting
the
recommendation
,
supported
by
the
ndma
label
readability
guidelines
,
that
45
point
minimum
type
size
be
allowed
on
smaller
labels
.
throughout
rulemaking
to
implement
the
1990
amendments
,
fda
has
responded
to
consumer
concerns
that
the
required
nutrition
information
be
presented
in
a
manner
that
will
improve
legibility
,
particularly
to
help
older
and
visionimpaired
vision
impaired
consumers
who
otherwise
would
be
effectively
denied
access
to
the
nutrition
information
.
because
type
size
is
a
major
determinant
of
legibility
,
fda
does
not
believe
type
sizes
less
than
45
points
should
be
allowed
on
package
labels
and
encourages
manufacturers
to
use
larger
type
size
when
label
space
allows
.
the
agency
finds
that
this
minimum
type
size
of
45
points
is
appropriate
on
packages
having
less
than
12
square
inches
of
surface
area
available
to
bear
labeling
.
the
agency
selected
less
than
of
12
square
inches
of
area
available
to
bear
labeling
as
a
result
of
its
review
of
the
comments
and
because
it
promotes
consistency
within
food
labeling
regulations
inasmuch
as
§
1012c3i
)
uses
this
package
size
as
the
standard
for
exempting
small
packages
of
foods
from
type
size
requirements
,
and
§
1019j13i
)
uses
it
to
differentiate
which
food
packages
may
use
a
telephone
number
or
address
for
consumers
to
use
in
obtaining
nutrition
information
as
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
nutrition
label
if
no
nutrient
content
or
health
claims
are
made
on
the
label
.
the
agency
also
finds
that
this
decision
is
reasonable
considering
the
practical
need
for
smaller
packages
containing
supplements
composed
of
many
vitamins
and
minerals
to
have
smaller
print
,
and
the
need
for
all
labels
to
be
as
legible
as
possible
.
therefore
,
the
agency
is
modifying
§
101
36
)
to
allow
for
packages
that
have
a
total
surface
area
available
to
bear
labeling
of
less
than
12
square
inches
to
use
45
point
type
size
.
fda
is
not
making
a
similar
change
for
dietary
supplements
of
herbs
and
of
other
similar
nutritional
substances
because
comments
did
not
demonstrate
the
same
space
concerns
for
those
products
.
additionally
,
the
agency
is
correcting
§
101
36
)
to
refer
to
paragraph
(
b3
)
instead
of
to
(
b4
)
and
to
refer
to

b4
)
instead
of
to
(
b4ii
.
there
were
inadvertent
errors
in
these
references
in
the
proposal
.
fda
advises
that
under
§
101
36
,
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
may
also
use
all
provisions
allowed
in
§
1019j13
)
to
help
accommodate
the
nutrition
label
on
small
and
intermediatesized
intermediate

.
if
,
despite
these
provisions
,
there
are
still

which
there
is

this
section
of
the
regulations
provides
several
additional
special
labeling
provisions
to
assist
manufacturers
in
fitting
the
required
information
on
both
small

these
provisions
,
which
can
apply
to

packages
,
include
using
specified
abbreviations

presenting

required
nutrition

on

additionally
,
this

provides
for
presenting

nutrition
information
may
be
given
in
a
linear

only
if

not
accommodate

in
response
to
the
comment
requesting
use
of
labeling
,
not
just
the
label
on
the
primary
container
,
to
convey
nutrition
information
,
the
agency
advises
that
it
has
traditionally
required
that
all
required
information
(
eg
,
the
statement
of
identity
,
net
weight
statement
,
ingredient
list
,
name
and
place
of
manufacture
,
and
nutrition
information
)
appear
on
the
label
of
packaged
foods
.
labeling
,
which
includes
materials
not
affixed
to
the
package
(
such
as
posters
,
notebooks
,
leaflets
,
and
brochures
available
at
the
point
of
purchase
,
may
become
separated
from
the
packaged
food
and
are
inappropriate
for
the
delivery
of
required
information
.
therefore
,
fda
concludes
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
grant
the
request
in
this
comment
.
however
,
fda
considers
outer
packaging
that
securely
encloses
a
primary
container
and
that
is
not
intended
to
be
separated
from
the
primary
container
under
conditions
of
retail
sale
to
be
the
equivalent
of
the
product
label
.
therefore
,
when
a
bottle
containing
a
dietary
supplement
in
tablet
,
granular
,
or
liquid
form
is
placed
within
a
sealed
box
,
the
required
information
must
be
present
on
the
outer
container
where
it
is
available
to
the
consumer
at
the
point
of
purchase
.
while
fda
regulations
do
not
require
that
the
information
be
repeated
on
the
primary
container
inside
the
box
,
the
agency
encourages
manufacturers
to
do
so
,
so
that
consumers
will
have
easy
access
to
the
information
once
the
container
is
removed
from
the
outer
box
.
likewise
,
if
supplements
are
sold
in
sealed
packaging
that
provides
a
cardboard
display
around
the
primary
container
,
the
full
display
seen
by
the
consumer
becomes
the
product
label
.
in
these
situations
,
the
required
information
shall
be
placed
on
appropriate
panels
as
directed
in
§
1011
and
1012
,
pertaining
to
the
principal
display
panel
and
the
information
panel
,
respectively
.
it
would
not
be
consistent
with
section
2b1a
)
of
the
1990
amendments
to
allow
packaging
with
less
than
40
square
inches
of
label
space
to
be
exempt
from
graphic
requirements
such
as
having
the
title
`
nutrition
facts
'
in
the
largest
print
within
the
nutrition
label
,
having
the
required
information
enclosed
within
a
box
,
and
using
hairlines
to
separate
nutrients
and
headings
.
as
stated
above
,
the
agency
concluded
in
the
mandatory
nutrition
labeling
final
rule
(
58
fr
2079
at
2136
)
that
if
the
nutrition
label
was
to
be
readily
observable
and
comprehensible
,
it
must
be
presented
in
as
consistent
a
manner
as
possible
from
label
to
label
.
thus
,
in
establishing
the
requirements
for
the
nutrition
label
,
the
agency
went
to
great
lengths
to
give
the
format
a
distinctive
look
(
eg

consistency
of

such
action
would
make
it
likely
that
some

would
fail
to
recognize
the

and
to
understand
the
significance
of
the
information
that
it
presented

for
this
reason
,
fda

not
providing
the
flexibility
requested

however
,
the

has
reviewed
the
format

in
response
to
these
comments
concerned
about
space
problems

to
help
alleviate
space
problems
,
the
agency
has
concluded
that
it
can
provide
for
flexibility
in
the
placement
of
the
heading
,
`

'
when
a
dietary
supplement
contains
less
than
5
calories

in
this
situation
,
shown
in
the

of
the

%
daily

'
is
placed
to
the
right

under
the
bar
beneath
the
heading
`
amount
per

'
because
there
is
sufficient
space
on
one
line
for
both
headings
,
the
agency
is
modifying
§
101

)
to
provide
that
the
heading
`

may
be
placed
on
the

that
,
if

the

is
not
convinced
by
the

the

knows
of
no

for
treating

in
response
to
this
and
the

to
alleviate

constraints
,
the
agency
advises
that
many
of
the
changes
that
fda
has
made
from
the

help
to
reduce
space
requirements
(
eg
,
reduced

if
manufacturers
find
that
it

to
fit
the

a
particular

they
may
write
to
the
office
of

as
directed
in

the
agency
points
out
that
any

may
be
printed

thus
,
the

may
be
printed
parallel
to
the
base

which
may
provide
more
space
for
this
information
.
however
,
fda
urges
manufacturers
to
strive
for
consistency
of
presentation
of

proposed
rule
on
the
format
for
nutrition
labeling
(
57

had
argued
that
a
consistent
look
to
the
required
nutrition
information
on
food
packages
will
help
consumers
find
the
information
on
the
package
and
to
recognize
it
for
what
it
isa
profile
of
the
nutrient
content
of
the
food

these
comments
convinced
fda
that
the
specific
format
elements
mandated
provide
a
visually
integrated
image
that
will
give
the
nutrition
label
a
uniform
appearance
across
the
various
types
of
packages
in

market
and
will
enhance
consumer
use
of
the
information
.
nothing
in
the
comments
on
proposed
§
101
36
provide
the
basis
for
a
different
conclusion
.
fda
finds
that
contrary
to
the
comments
'
assertion
,
this
bar
contributes
directly
to
the
consistent
look
of
the
nutrition
label
.
to
avoid
any
possible
interference
of
the
bar
at
the
bottom
of
the
nutrition
label
with
the
scanning
of
the
upc
symbol
,
manufacturers
may
design
the
package
layout
so
that

.
one
comment
requested
that
bars
be
required
after
`
serving
size
'
and
`
amount
per
serving
'
the
agency
points
out
that
§
101
36
)
requires
that
the
heading
`
amount
per
serving
'
be
separated
from
other
information
on
the
label
by
a
bar
above
and
beneath
it
.
thus
,
the
upper
bar
will
be
beneath
the
declaration
of
`
servings
per
container
'
or
,
when
`
servings
per
container
'
is
not
required
,
of
`

size
'
the
lower
bar
would
separate
the
declaration
`
amount
per
serving
'
from
the
heading
`
percent
daily
value
'
the
agency
notes
that
this
bar
should
follow
information
on
calories
,
when
that
information
is
declared
(
ie
,
when
the
dietary
supplement
of
vitamins
and
minerals
contains
5
or
more
calories
,
to
be
consistent
with
the
labeling
of
foods
in
conventional
food
form
(
1019d6
.
however
,
the
agency
inadvertently
failed
to
specify
in
the
proposed
rule
where
this
bar
should
be
placed
.
as
discussed
in
the
nutrition
labeling
proposal
for
dietary
supplements
(

the

a
manner
as
similar
as
possible
to
the
nutrition

of
foods
in

.
therefore
,
fda
finds
that
it
is
the
logical
outgrowth
of
the
proposal
to
specify
in
this
final
rule
where
the
bar
following
`

be
placed
when

least
three
comments
requested
that
dietary
supplements
be
able
to
indicate
compliance
with
united
states
pharmacopeia
(
usp
)
requirements
.
one
of
these
comments
requested
that
a
new
paragraph
,
§
101
36
,
be
added
that
would
provide
that
the
label
could
bear
a
box
entitled
`
nutrition
facts
'
that
would
contain
nutrition
information
for
usp
recognized
substances
that
are
the
source
of
vitamins
and
minerals
.
immediately
below
that
box
,
the
label
would
bear
another
section
entitled
,
`
other
ingredients
'
that
would
list
all
additional
ingredients
present
in
more
than
insignificant
amounts
,
followed
by
a
listing
of
all
other
added
substances
incorporated
in
the
product
as

.
the
comment
stated
that
by
listing
all
other
ingredients
present
,
consistency
with
section
411b2ai
)
of
the
act
would
be
achieved
.
alternatively
,
this
comment
requested
that
the
following
sentence
be
added
after
the
first
sentence
of
§
101
36
:
`
such
allowances
will
also
be
considered
where
a
firm
produces
an
article
that
purports
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
official
usp
and
seeks
to
label
it
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
pharmacopeia
'
the
comment
stated
that
this
new
sentence
would
allow
firms
to
comply
with
usp
labeling
requirements
with
fdas
permission
.
additionally
,
this
comment
requested
that
the
name
of
products
that
meet
usp
quality
standards
be
followed
by
the
letters
`
usp
'
both
of
the
comments
suggested
changes
in
§
101
36
)
would
allow
for
two
very
different
forms
of
nutrition
labeling
on
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
,
depending
upon
whether
a
manufacturer
chose
to
follow
fdas
requirements
,
which
are
generally
consistent
with
§
1019
,
or
usps
,
which
would
list
only
usp
recognized
nutrients
in
the
top
box
.
a
manufacturers
decision
to
follow
the
usp
approach
would
result
in
a
nutrition
label
that
was
inconsistent
with
labels
of
other
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
,
with
dietary
supplements
of
herbs
and
other
similar
nutritional
substances
,
and
with
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
the
comment
also
appears
to
request
that
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
a
nutrient
should
be
listed
in
the
nutrition
label
should
be
based
upon
its
usp
status
.
fda
finds
that
it
would
not
be
consistent
with
section
2b1a
)
of
the
1990
amendments
to
provide
the
flexibility
sought
by
these
comments
.
as
discussed
in
response
to
earlier
comments
,
the
agency
decided
in
the
mandatory
nutrition
labeling
final
rule
that
if
the
nutrition
label
was
to
be
readily
observable
and
comprehensible
,
it
must
be
presented
in
as
consistent
a
manner
as
possible
from
label
to
label
.
thus
,
it
was
the
agencys
determination
that
,
whenever
possible
,
nutrition
labeling
requirements
should
ensure
a
distinctive
look
and
order
of
nutrients
to
facilitate
consumer
recognition
and
understanding
of
the
label
and
to
encourage
use
of
the
information
.
allowing
two
different
nutrition
labeling
schemes
would
make
it
likely
that
some
consumers
would
fail
to
recognize
the
nutrition
information
or
would
be
too
confused
to
be
able
to
use
it
fully
.
fda
has
made
the
same
decision
with
respect
to
dietary
supplements
and
thus
is
not
providing
the
flexibility
requested
.
however
,
in
regard
to
the
request
that
the
name
of
ingredients
of
usp
quality
be
allowed
to
indicate
usp
status
,
the
agency
advises
that
although
statements
appearing
outside
of
the
nutrition
label
are
beyond
the
scope
of
this
final
rule
,
it
would
not
object
to
the
use
of
truthful
and
nonmisleading
statements
regarding
usp
status
elsewhere
on
product
labels
.
further
,
fda
would
not
object
to
the
use
of
the
usp
symbol
in
the
ingredient
list
to
identify
those
ingredients
that
are
usp
grade
.
the
agency
advises
that
it
will
not
consider
the
usp
symbol
,
when
used
in
this
way
,
to
constitute
intervening
material
in
the
ingredient
list
.

one
comment
requested
that
fda
recognize
usp
methodology
.
this
comment
stated
that
§
101
36
)
requires
that
dietary
supplements
comply
with
§
1019g2
,
which
specifies
association
of
official
analytical
chemists
(
aoac
)
test
methodology
for
nutrient
analysis
.
the
agency
wishes
to
clarify
that
§
1019g2
)
states
that
when
fda
determines
compliance
,
it
will
analyze
composite
samples
by
appropriate
methods
as
given
in
the
`
official
methods
of
analysis
of
the
aoac
international
'
15th
edition
,
or
,
if
no
aoac
method
is
available
or
appropriate
,
by
other
reliable
and
appropriate
analytical
procedures
.
manufacturers
,
however
,
are
free
to
use
whatever
methodology
they
believe
will
give
results
consistent
with
methods
used
by
fda
.
therefore
,
the
requested
change
is
unnecessary
.

one
comment
requested
that
the
compliance
criteria
be
revised
to
allow
the
actual

to
be
90
percent

instead
of

added
vitamins
and
minerals
provide
at
least
the
amount
declared
for
each
nutrient
.
the
comment
stated
that
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
fact
that
many
dietary
supplements
,
while
formulated
to
contain
at
least
100
percent
of
the
declared
amount
,
are
designed
to
retain
only
at
least
90
percent
of
their
declared
amount
over
the
shelf
life
declared
on
these
products
.
the
comment
attributed
this
practice
to
the
fact
that
usp
monographs
for
several
nutritional
products
require
a
minimum
nutrient
content
of
90
percent
of
the
label
declaration
.
the
agency
is
not
persuaded
by
this
comment
.
as
previously
discussed
in
response
to
a
similar
comment
in
the
mandatory
nutrition
labeling
final
rule
(
58
fr
2079
at
2171
,
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
are
fabricated
products
.
the
comments
provided
no
convincing
reason
for
why
they
should
not
be
held
to
the
same
standards
as
foods
in
conventional
food
form
that
are
fortified
or
enriched
.
the
agency
has
informed
usp
that
anything
less
than
100
percent
of
the
value
declared
on
the
label
for
vitamin
and
mineral
products
is
not
acceptable
to
fda
,
and
that
the
only
permissible
deviation
from
this
requirement
would
be
a
deviation
that
is
attributable
to
the
variability
of
the
analytical
method
(
ref
.
8
.
the
agency
notes
that
,
contrary
to
the
statement
in
the
comments
,
the
general
notices
of
the
usp
state
that
a
dosage
should
be
formulated
to
provide
100
percent
of
the
labeled
amount
(
ref
.
9
.
the
limits
in
the
usp
monographs
allow
for
overages
of
ingredients
known
to
decrease
with
time
,
for
analytical
error
,
for
manufacturing
and
compounding
variations
,
and
for
deterioration
to
an
extent
considered
insignificant
under
practical
conditions
(

one
comment
pertained
to
small
businesses
.
the
comment
stated
that
`
burdening
the
manufacturer
with
the
cost
of
the
nutrition
labeling
requirements
(
listing
that
a
vitamin
supplement
contains
no
fat
,
no
protein
,
no
carbohydrate
,
etc
)
would
be
a
useless
exercise
,
especially
in
the
case
of
the
marketing
of
a
single
ingredient
substance
'
the
comment
requested
that
§
101
36
)
of
the
proposed
rule
be
revised
to
either
delete
the
nutrition
labeling
requirement
for
small
businesses
or
to
allow
the
nutrition
label
to
declare
only
those
nutrients
actually
present
in
the
supplement
.
the
agency
believes
that
this
comment
misunderstood
the
proposed
rule
.
as
the
comment
requested
,
the
agency
requires
nutrition
labeling
`
only
with
respect
to
those
substances
actually
contained
in
the
supplement
'
manufacturers
are
not
burdened
with
the
cost
of
declaring
that
a
vitamin
supplement
contains
no
fat
,
no
protein
,
or
no
carbohydrate
if
they
do
not
.
only
nutrients
present
in
significant
amounts
are
required
to
be
declared
under
§
101
36
.
therefore
,
the
agency
is
not
changing
the
regulation
in
response
to
this
comment
.
fda
notes
that
congress
recently
passed
,
and
the
president
signed
on
08/13/1993
,
the
nutrition
labeling
and
education
act
amendments
of
1993
(
pub
.
l
.
10380
)
that
modified
the
treatment
of
small
businesses
.
as
a
result
of
this
change
,
the
exemption
from
nutrition
labeling
requirements
for
small
businesses
that
are
food
manufacturers
will
be
based
on
the
number
of
employees
in
a
firm
and
the
number
of
units
of
each
product
sold
.
fda
expects
to
publish
a
proposal
to
amend

1019

reflect
the
new

one
comment
stated
that
§
1019k1
)
through
(

)
should
not
apply
to
dietary
supplements
.
the
comment
stated
that
§
1019k1
)
is
overbroad
such
that
it
suppresses
truthful
,
nonmisleading
speech
about
the
beneficial
properties
of
a
nutrient
supplement
product
that
may
,
by
virtue
of
the
supplements
inherent
properties
,
not
only
be
a
food
but
also
aid
in
the
prevention
,
cure
,
mitigation
,
or
treatment
of
any
disease
.
this
comment
did
not
focus
on
why
§
1019k2
)
through
(
k6
)
should
not
apply
to
dietary
supplements
.
other
comments
specifically
mentioned
that
the
first
sentence
of
§
1019k5
)
is
vague
,
confusing
,
and
contradictory
.
this
sentence
provides
that
a
food
shall
be
deemed
to
be
misbranded
if
its
label
or
labeling
represents
,
suggests
,
or
implies
that
the
food
has
dietary
properties
when
such
properties
are
of
no
significant
value
or
need
in
human
nutrition
.
these
comments
suggested
that
this
sentence
be
revised
to
read
:
`
a
food
shall
be
deemed
to
be
misbranded
if
its
label
claims
or
represents
that
the
food
has
a
significant
value
or
need
in
human
nutrition
when
the
scientific
evidence
for
the
claim
does
not
exist
'
these
comments
argued
that
this
change
is
necessary
because
`
significant
value
or
need
in
human
nutrition
'
is
a
matter
of
consumer
perception
.
they
said
that
to
a
small
child
,
the
need
for
eating
spinach
is
very
low
,
but
to
the
mother
the
need
for
spinach
is
very
high
.
other
comments
specifically
agreed
that
§
1019k
)
should
apply
to
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
.
the
agency
does
not
agree
with
the
comment
that
§
1019k1
)
through
(
k6
)
should
not
apply
to
dietary
supplements
,
or
that
§
1019k1
)
suppresses
truthful
,
nonmisleading
speech
.
the
comment
did
not
provide
any
basis
for
the
agency
to
conclude
that
this
provision
is
not
applicable
to
dietary
supplements
,
or
that
it
suppresses
truthful
,
nonmisleading
speech
.
in
the
final
rule
on
nutrition
labeling
of
01/06/1993
(
58
fr
2079
at
2167
,
the
agency
pointed
out
that
the
provisions
of
§
1019i
)
(
redesignated
as
(
k
)
had
long
been
in
effect
at
the
time
congress
drafted
the
1990
amendments
.
while
congress
did
enact
provisions
under
the
1990
amendments
that
allow
for
health
claims
on
foods
,
nothing
in
the
act
or
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
suggest
that
congress
intended
that
§
1019i
)
should
be
changed
.
nor
did
the
comments
present
any
persuasive
arguments
that
§
1019k5
)
of
the
proposed
rule
should
be
amended
.
the
agency
does
not
agree
that
whether
or
not
a
significant
value
or
need
in
human
nutrition
has
been
established
is
a
matter
of
consumer
perception
.
the
agency
notes
that
the
phrase
`
significant
value
or
need
in
human
nutrition
'
was
promulgated
and
published
in
the
federal
register
of
01/19/1973
(
38
fr
2125
.
in
that
final
rule
(
38
fr
2125
at
2128
,
the
agency
explained
that
over
the
years
there
have
been
a
number
of
ingredients
of
products
marketed
as
nutrients
and
nutritional
supplements
that
have
not
been
shown
to
be
essential
in
human
nutrition
,
such
as
rutin
,
other
bioflavonoids
,
paraaminobenzoic
para
aminobenzoic
acid
,
and
inositol
.
the
agency
stated
that
calling
attention
to
these
ingredients
in
a
manner
that
implies
some
nutritional
benefit
is
misleading
.
the
agency
concludes
that
the
language
of
§
1019k5
)
remains
clear
and
does
not
need
clarification
.
therefore
,
the
agency
is
making
no
change
in
§
1019b
)
in
response
to
these
comments
.

.
other
provisions
fda
did
not
receive
any
comments
that
dealt
specifically
with
the
other
provisions
of
the
proposal
.
in
the
absence
of
any
basis
for
doing
otherwise
,
fda
is
adopting
those
provisions
as
proposed
.
v
.
economic
impact
in
its
dietary
supplement
labeling
proposals
of
06/18/1993
,
fda
stated
that
the
proposed
rules
on
the
labeling
of
dietary
supplements
,
taken
as
a
whole
,
would
have
associated
costs
of
approximately
$
20
million
.
thus
,
the
agency
concluded
that
the
proposed
rules
do
not
constitute
a
major
rule
as
defined
by
executive
order
12291
.
in
accordance
with
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
(
pub
.
l
.
96354
,
fda
explored
whether
the
proposed
rules
may
have
a
significant
impact
on
small
businesses
and
tentatively
concluded
that
they
do
not
.
fda
has
evaluated
the
many
comments
that
it
received
in
response
to
its
economic
impact
analysis
.
because
the
issues
raised
in
the
comments
relate
to
all
three
proposals
,
fda
has
combined
its
discussion
of
these
comments
and
presented
them
in
the
final
rule
regarding
a
delay
in
the
date
of
application
,
which
is
published
elsewhere
in
this
issue
of
the
federal
register
fda
has
examined
the
economic
implications
of
the
final
rules
amending
21
cfr
as
required
by
executive
order
12866
and
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
.
executive
order
12866
directs
agencies
to
assess
all
costs
and
benefits
of
available
regulatory
alternatives
and
,
when
regulation
is
necessary
,
to
select
regulatory
approaches
that
maximize
net
benefits
(
including
potential
economic
,
environmental
,
public
health
and
safety
effects
;
distributive
impacts
;
and
equity
.
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
requires
that
the
agency
analyze
options
for
regulatory
relief
for
small
businesses
.
fda
has
concluded
,
based
on
its
review
of
the
available
data
and
comments
,
that
these
final
rules
are
not
significant
as
defined
by
executive
order
12866
.
further
,
in
accordance
with
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
,
the
agency
certifies
that
these
final
rules
will
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
businesses

environmental

the
agency
has
determined

that
this
action
is
of
a
type
that
does
not
individually
or
cumulatively
have
a
significant
effect
on
the
human
environment

therefore
,
neither
an
environmental
