may
request
that
the
secretary
determine
whether
such
substance
should
be
listed
as
a

the
secretary
shall
add
such
substance
to
the
list
of
taxable
substances

,
the
secretary
determined
that
glycerine
and
phenol
should
be
added
to
the
list
of
taxable
substances
in
section
4672a3
,
effective
01/01/1991

the
rate
of
tax
prescribed
for
glycerine
,
under
section

,
is
$
9
52
per

the
rate
of
tax
prescribed
for
phenol
,
under
section

glycerine
is
derived
from
the
taxable
chemicals
propylene
,
chlorine
,
and
sodium
hydroxide
.
glycerine
is
a
liquid
produced
predominantly
by
the
reaction
of
epichlorohydrin
with
an
aqueous
caustic
carbonate
solution
,
followed
by
the
removal
of
water
,
sodium
chloride
,
and
other
impurities
by
mechanical
means
,
chemical
extraction
,
and
distillation
.
the
stoichiometric

for
glycerine

glycerine
has
been
determined
to
be
a
taxable
substance
because
a
review
of
its
stoichiometric
material
consumption
formula
shows
that
,
based
on
the
predominant
method
of
production
,
taxable
chemicals
constitute
935
percent
by
weight
of
the
materials
used
in
its
production
.
phenol
hts
number
:

cas
number
:

phenol
is
derived
from
the
taxable
chemicals
benzene
and
propylene
.
phenol
is
a
solid
produced
predominantly
based
on
cumene
peroxidation
.
the
stoichiometric
material
consumption
formula
for
phenol
is
:
(

phenol
has
been
determined
to
be
a
taxable
substance
because
a
review
of
its
stoichiometric
material
consumption
formula
shows
that
,
based
on
the
predominant
method
of
production
,
taxable
chemicals
constitute
789
percent
by
weight
of
the
materials
used
in
its
production
