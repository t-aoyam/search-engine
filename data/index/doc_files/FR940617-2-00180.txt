the
applicant
funds
'
currently
outstanding

be
designated

applicants
contemplate

(
class

at
net
asset
value
without
the

of

the
class

shares
would
be
subject
to
a
cdsc
,
as
further
described
below
.
class
b
shares
would
not
be
issued
in
connection
with
investments
of

rather
such
investors
would

applicants
contemplate

a
shareholder
automatically
will
convert

after
a
certain
holding
period

acquired
through
the
reinvestment
of
dividends

distributions
will
be
considered
held

each
time
any

converts
to

internal
revenue
service
ruling
that
such
conversion
does
not
constitute
a
taxable
event
under
federal
income
tax
law

not
available
.
the
conversion
feature
would
benefit
longterm
long

class
b

by
relieving
them
of

of
the
burden
of
distribution
expenses

the
distributor
has
been
compensated

each

other
service
rendered
to
the
class
,
or
to
the
fund
.
expenses
specific
to
a
particular
class
of
shares
may
be
calculated
and
charged
to
the
respective
class
.
all
other
expenses
incurred
by
a
fund
will
be
allocated
between
the
various
classes
based

the
percentage
of
net
assets
of
the
class
at
the
beginning
of
the
day
after
adjusting
for
the
prior
days

because
of
the
differing

one
class
of

may
be
higher
or
lower
than
those
of
the
other
classes
of
shares
of
the
same
fund
.
to
the
extent
that
a
fund
has
undistributed
net
income
,
the
net
asset
value
of
the
various
classes
of
shares
of
the
fund
may
differ
.

.
applicants
contemplate
that
any
class
of
shares
of
a
fund
may
be
exchanged
for
shares
of
the
corresponding
class
of
other
funds
.
exchanges
also
are
permitted
into

also
seek
exemptive
relief
to
permit
the
funds
to
impose
a
cdsc
on
redemptions
of
class
b
shares
,
and
possibly
other
future
classes
of
shares
.
the
period
during
which
the
cdsc
will
apply
(
the
`
cdsc
period
)
and
the
cdsc
percentage
will
vary
with
the
amount
of
the
investment
,
and
is
expected
to
vary
in
the
future
depending
on
any
plan
fees
,
if
any
,
imposed
by
a
fund
with
respect
to
the
shares
subject
to
the
cdsc
.
the
cdsc
only
would
be
imposed
on
shares
issued
on
or
after
the
date
that
the
requested
order
is
granted
.
in
addition
,
any
amendments
to
the
cdsc
will
apply
only
when
they
are
reflected
in
an
amended
and
supplemented
prospectus
,
and
no
such
amendments
adversely
would
affect
shares
issued
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
such
amendment
.
9
.
the
applicable
cdsc
will
be
calculated
on
the
lesser
of
the
net
asset
value
at
the
time
the
shares
were
issued
or
redeemed
.
no
cdsc
will
be
imposed
on
amounts
representing
capital
appreciation
,
shares
or
amounts
representing
shares
purchased
through
the
reinvestment
of
dividends
or
capital
gains
distributions
,
or
shares
held
for
longer
than
the
cdsc
period
.
it
will
be
assumed
that
redemptions
will
be
made
first
of
shares
not
subject
to
a
cdsc
in
the
order
purchased
,
and
then
of
shares
subject
to
a
cdsc
in
the
order
purchased
.
if
a
shareholder
owns
more
than
one
class
of
shares
and
does
not
specify
which
shares
are
to
be
redeemed
,
shares
not
subject
to
a
cdsc
with
the
highest
plan
fees
will
be
redeemed
in
full
prior
to
any
redemptions
of
shares
not
subject
to
a
cdsc
with
lower
plan
fees
.

applicants
intend
to
waive
the
cdsc
on
redemptions
of

from
the
exercise
of
