the

is
a
small
fish
that
inhabits
both
the
comal
and
san

ecosystems
and
was
described
by
early
collectors
to
be
abundant
in
both
ecosystems

habitat
for
this
salamander
usually
includes
aquatic
mosses

filimentous
algae
that
provide
cover

have
been
found
near
all
major
spring
openings
scattered

and
critical
habitat
designated

this
plant
is
only
known
from
the

river
system
where
it
was
once
abundant
in
spring
lake
and
the
river
.
by
1967
,
the
species
had
declined
significantly
in
abundance
and
distribution

plants
usually
grow
underwater
except
for

and
are
found
in
constant
temperature
,
flowing
water
of
varying

the
texas

was
listed
as
endangered
on
03/11/1967
(

habitat
is
in
waterfilled
water
filled
cavernous
areas
in
the
san

portion
of
the
edwards
aquifer

the
species
has
been
collected
and
studied
through
collections
and
observations
made
from
caves
with
pools
that
access
the
underground
water
table
,
and
from

samples
.
the
most
imminent
threat
facing
the
five
listed
aquatic
species
is
loss
of
stream
flows
and
or
water
levels
in
the
edwards
aquifer
necessary
to
sustain
the
edwards
aquifer
and
associated
stream
ecosystems
.
the
species
are
also
threatened
by
pollution
from
runoff
or
discharges
associated
with
urbanization
of
surrounding
areas
.
additional
threats
include
impacts
from
recreational
activities
,
predation
,
and
habitat
destruction
or
modification
caused
by
human
activities
.
the
objective
of
the
draft
plan
is
to
secure
the
survival
of
these
endangered
or
threatened
species
in
their
native
ecosystems
.
downlisting
criteria
are
given
in
the
plan
for
two
of
the
five
species
.
the
draft
plan
addresses
broad
regional
threats
to
ecosystem
integrity
as
well
as
local
threats
to
each
species
.
regional
recovery
efforts
outlined
in
the
draft
plan
include
protection
of
the
edwards
aquifer
,
the
san
marcos
springs
and
river
ecosystem
,
and
the
comal
springs
and
river
ecosystem
.
the
draft
plan
addresses
need
for
a
mechanism
to
manage
groundwater
withdrawals
in
order
to
assure
continued
springflows
,
and
identification
and
management
of
existing
or
potential
impacts
to
water
quality
in
the
edwards
aquifer
and
the
comal
and
san
marcos
river
ecosystems
.
to
address
more
local
threats
,
the
draft
plan
recommends
development
of
local
spring
and
river
management
plans
,
control
of
nonnative
native
species
,
and
cooperative
work
with
local
landowners
and
water
users
to
alleviate
threats
to
the
affected
species
and
their
habitat
.
other
recovery
efforts
outlined
include
developing
propagation
techniques
and
maintaining
a
broodstock
that
represents
genetics
of
existing
wild
populations
.
the
draft
plan
includes
tasks
to
continue
monitoring
the
status
of
all
five
species
and
their
habitats
,
research
to
determine
the
biological
and
ecological
requirements
of
each
species
,
studies
to
evaluate
threats
and
develop
management
techniques
of
each
species
,
and
inform
the
public
of
significance
of
these
ecosystems
to
maintaining
the
regions
economy
and
quality
of
life
for
all
.
