preliminary
issues
identified
so

have
been
grouped
into
seven
major
categories
:

,
and

areas
;
water

;
and

.
issues
commonly
associated
with
effects
of
timber

construction
are
grouped
into
these
seven
categories
.
the
complete
list
is
available
upon
request
from
the
powell
district
ranger
.
this
list
may
be
verified
,
expanded
,
or
modified
based
on
public
scoping
for
this
proposal
.
the
draft
eis
is
expected
to
be
filed
with
the
environmental
protection
agency
(
epa
)
and
available
for
public
review
in
september
of
1994
.
at
that
time
,
the
epa
will
publish
a
notice
of
availability
of
the
draft
eis
in
the
federal
register
.
the
comment
period
on
the
draft
eis
will
be
45
days
from
the
date
the

notice
of

appears
in
the
federal

.
it
is
very
important
that
those
interested
in
management
of
the
white

area
participate
at
that
time
.
to
be
most
helpful
,
comments

the
forest
service
believes
,
at
this
early
stage
,
it
is
important
to
give
reviewers
notice
of
several
court
rulings
related
to
public
participation
in
the
environmental
review
process
.
first
,
reviewers
of
draft
environmental
impact
statements
must
structure
their
participation
in
the
environmental
review
of
the
proposal
so
that
it
is
meaningful
and
alerts
an
agency
to
the
reviewers
position
and
contentions

because
of

very
important
that
those
interested
in

participate
by
the

of

period
so
that
substantive
comments

are

at
a
time
when
it
can
meaningfully
consider
them

them

to
assist
the

in
