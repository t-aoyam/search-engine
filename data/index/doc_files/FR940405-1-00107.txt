the
cost
for
providing
maintenance
first
requires
an
estimate
of
the
number
of
buildings
without
regular
hvac
maintenance
.
the
1989
commercial
buildings
characteristics
survey
by
the
department
of
energy
estimates
that
46
percent
of
the
buildings
have
regular
hvac
maintenance
.
therefore
,
the
total
number
of
buildings
requiring
maintenance
is
estimated
at
23
million
.
osha
then
determined
the
number
of
problem
buildings
without
hvac
maintenance
by
applying
the
osha
estimate
of
30
percent
(
presented
in
section
b
.
the
number
of
problem
buildings
without
hvac
maintenance
is
estimated
at
07
million
.
in
general
,
the
average
cost
per
year
to
maintain
a
commercial
hvac
system
is
a
function
of
a
number
of
factors
.
these
factors
include
the
type
of
system
,
the
age
of
the
system
,
the
size
of
the
system
,
layout
of
the
system
,
reliability
of
the
equipment
installed
.
in
addition
to
the
physical
characteristics
of
the
system
,
the
cost
per
year
to
maintain
the
system
also
depends
on
the
operation
of
the
system
,
the
maintenance
policies
of
the
owner
,
the
skill
levels
of
the
operating
engineers
and
maintenance
workers
,
and
whether
the
maintenance
is
carried
out
by
employees
of
the
building
owner
or
is
the
responsibility
of
an
outside
company

therefore

to
compute
the

of

.
in
addition
to
regular
hvac
maintenance
,
buildings
with
known
iaq
problems
will
require
other
improvements
such
as
(

)
relocating
air
intakes
and
other
pathways
of

to
restrict

of

installing

or
(

or
(

)
reduce

,
or
(

)
monitor

quantity
to
meet
ventilation
requirements
.
the
national
energy
management
institute
developed
a
cost
model
for
implementing
iaq
improvements
which
is
based
on
the
distribution
of
buildings
with
iaq
problems
by
climate
zone
,
building
activity
and
size
,
and
characteristics
of
ventilation
systems
.
the
average
cost
to
implement
the
actions
listed
above
are
estimated
to
be
$

per

.
these
improvements
will
only
be
required
