therefore
,
once

is
the
clear
and
projected
winner
of
the
primary
election
process
and
begins
to
campaign
by
addressing
issues
and

with

costs

prior

candidates

election
date
of
ineligibility
are
considered
general
election
expenses
that
are
reimbursable
by
the
general
election
committee
.
the
commission
is
seeking
comments
on
whether
the
pertinent
rules
should
provide
more
specific
guidance
on
how
certain
expenditures
might
be
characterized
.
questions
have
arisen
in
recent
election
cycles
as
to
whether
certain
primary
funding
was
in
fact
used
to
benefit
the
general
election
.
as
additional
states
choose
to
hold
their
state
nominating
conventions
or
primary
elections
early
in
the
election
cycle
,
the
major
parties
'
selection
of
a
nominee
is
increasingly
likely
to
be
decided
long
before
the
convention
.
once
a
candidate
has
secured
enough
delegates
to
win
the
nomination
,
the
focus
of
the
campaign
may
turn
in
large
part
to
the
general
election
.
however
,
the
commission
realizes
that
it
can
be
difficult
to
distinguish
between
legitimate
primary
campaign
activity
,
such
as
that
which
is
designed
to
lock
up
delegates
,
or
is
related
to
the
primary
outcomes
or
preconvention
convention
preparation
,
from
activity
that
is
geared
towards
the
general
election
.
the
commission
is
considering
several
alternatives
that
would
provide
additional
guidance
to
presidential
campaign
committees
on
how
such
expenditures
are
treated
.
the
commission
welcomes
comments
on
any
of
these
approaches
,
as
well
as
suggestions
on
other
ways
available
to
deal
with
this
situation
.
one
question
concerns
depreciation
of
primary
committee
assets
in
this
situation
.
section
90345c1
)
currently
permits
a
standard
40
%
depreciation
of
capital
assets
held
by
a
primary
campaign
committee
,
except
for
items
acquired
after
the
committees
doi
.
a
higher
depreciation
is
allowed
for
a
particular
item
if
the
committee
demonstrates
through
documentation
that
the
assets
fair
market
value
is
lower
.
under
certain
circumstances
,
however
,
the
40
%
figure
may
be
overly
generous
.
for
example
,
if
the
primary
committee
purchases
a
$
20000
computer
system
shortly
before
the
primary
election
doi
and
then
sells
it
to
the
general
election
committee
,
allowing
the
primary
campaign
to
assume
a
40
%
depreciation
would
result
in
a
nearly
$
8000
subsidy
from
the
primary
to
the
general
election
committee
.
the
commission
is
therefore
proposing
that
paragraph
90345c1
)
be
amended
to
clarify
that
a
higher
,
lower
,
or
no
depreciation
may
be
claimed
in
appropriate
cases
.
current
11
cfr
90344b3
)
states
that
expenses
incurred
after
a
candidates
primary
election
doi
are
not
considered
qualified
campaign
expenses
,
except
for
certain
winding
down
costs
and
costs
incurred
in
continuing
to
campaign
.
see
11
cfr
90344a3
.
the
commission
is
considering
whether
this
language
should
be
expanded
to
clarify
that
,
consistent
with
26
usc
.
900211b
)
and
11
cfr

,
goods
received
prior
to
the
doi
that
are
used
for
the
general
election
,
and
predoi
doi
services
that
provide
a
benefit
to
the
general
election
campaign
,
are
considered
qualified
campaign
expenses
for
the
general
election
and
not
for
the
primary
election
.
one
approach
would
be
to
allocate
the
cost
of
each
capital
asset
between
the
primary
and
the
general
election
,
based
on
when
the
asset
was
acquired
and
the
time
the
committee
began
to
focus
on
the
general
election
.
this
could
be
difficult
to
administer
,
however
,
requiring
as
it
would
an
assetbyasset
asset
by
asset
determination
.
another
approach
would
be
to
include
a
presumption
in
section
90344b3
)
that
capital
assets
purchased
during
a
certain
period
before
the
first
day
of
the
candidates
partys
national
nominating
convention
are
general
election
assets
.
section
90344b3
)
of
the
proposed
rules
would
set
a
presumed
cutoff
date
of
60
days
before
the
start
of
the
candidates
partys
national
nominating
convention
.
however
,
the
commission
is
requesting
comments
on
whether
some
other
cutoff
point
would
better
serve
this
purpose
,
as
well
as
whether
a
uniform
cutoff
date
,
such
as
june
15
preceding
the
national
nominating
convention
,
would
be
more
appropriate
.
if
so
,
what
date
should
be
selected
?
if
a
more
flexible
approach
is
desirable
,
how
should
the
applicable
timeframe
be
computed
?
should
it
be
the
date
of
the
candidates
partys
last
state
primary
election
?
whatever
approach
is
adopted
,
the
presumption
would
be
rebuttable
based
on
each
candidates
particular
circumstances
.
if
a
candidate
could
demonstrate
that
he
or
she
was
still
largely
involved
in
campaigning
for
the
nomination
after
the
presumptive
cutoff
date
,
that
date
could
be
moved
back
.
in
the
case
of
a
brokered
convention
,
several
candidates
might
be
found
to
have
focused
nearly
exclusively
on
securing
the
nomination
until
the
date
during
the
convention
on
which
one
in
fact
did
so
.
conversely
,
a
candidate
who
became
the
clear
and
projected
nominee
of
a
party
early
in
the
presidential
election
year
might
be
found
to
have
made
expenditures
in
connection
with
the
general
election
well
in
advance
of
the
designated
cutoff
date
.
