conclusion
since
the
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
was
formally
listed
as
a
threatened
species
in
11/19/1990
(
55
fr
46515
,
the
annual
estimated
run
sizes
have
become
more
variable
and
have
continued
to
decline
with
the
exception
of
an
increase
in
1992
.
although
some
protective
measures
were
implemented
beginning
in
1987
,
the
decline
was
exacerbated
by
a
6year
year
drought
in
california
(
19871992
)
and
threats
adversely
affecting
the
species
that
were
not
addressed
until
recently
.
based
on
the
run
size
estimates
for
the
last
3
years
(
19911993
,
the
population
now
has
at
least
one
and
possibly
two
extremely
weak
year
classes
(
1991
and
1993
.
nmfs
expects
that
the
1994
run
will
also
be
weak
because
of
the
small
numbers
of
adults
returning
in
1991
(
191
fish
)
and
less
than
favorable
conditions
for
spawning
,
egg
incubation
,
and
juvenile
outmigration
that
occurred
in
199192
.
this
years
class
is
likely
to
remain
weakened
for
the
foreseeable
future
.
although
conditions
for
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
began
improving
in
1992
and
1993
because
of
protective
measures
implemented
to
reduce
the
longterm
long
term
impacts
of
operations
of
the
federal
and
state
water
projects
and
improve
conditions
for
successful
egg
incubation
,
rearing
,
and
outmigration
,
the
6year
year
drought
ended
,
and
the
natural
production
of
juveniles
is
being
supplemented
with
hatchery
produced
fish
,
nmfs
believes
that
quantifiable
improvements
in
population
levels
are
not
likely
to
be
evident
for
several
years
.
since
the
effectiveness
of
these
recently
implemented
protective
measures
and
supplementation
efforts
is
unknown
and
cannot
be
assessed
until
future
runs
return
,
there
remains
substantial
risk
that
the
population
is
in
danger
of
extinction
.
based
on
the
continued
decline
of
the
population
and
increased
variability
of
run
sizes
since
1991
,
the
expected
weak
return
in
1994
,
continuing
threats
to
the
population
,
and
uncertainty
about
whether
recently
implemented
protective
and
conservation
measures
will
be
effective
,
nmfs
believes
that
the
sacramento
river
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
is
in
danger
of
becoming
extinct
and
should
be
classified
as
an
endangered
species
.
nmfs
will
continue
to
monitor
closely
the
status
of
this
population
as
well
as
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
existing
and
future
protective
and
conservation
measures
to
determine
whether
any
further
changes
in
its
status
are
warranted
.
available
conservation
measures
conservation
measures
provided
to
species
that
are
listed
under
the
esa
include
listing
,
recovery
actions
,
implementation
of
certain
protective
measures
,
and
designation
and
protection
of
critical
habitat
.
some
of
the
most
useful
protective
measures
are
contained
in
section
7
of
the
esa
.
pursuant
to
section
7
,
federal
agencies
are
required
to
conduct
conservation
programs
for
endangered
species
and
to
consult
with
nmfs
regarding
the
potential
effects
of
their
actions
on
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
since
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
was
originally
listed
as
a
threatened
species
on
an
emergency
basis
in
08/19/1989
,
nmfs
has
conducted
numerous
section
7
consultations
with
federal
agencies
whose
actions
may
affect
the
species
.
the
most
significant
consultations
have
been
with
the
bureau
and
the
california
department
of
water
resources
concerning
the
longterm
long
term
operations
of
the
central
valley
project
and
the
state
water
project
and
the
corps
concerning
fish
passage
at
the
gcid
diversion
facility
at
hamilton
city
.
nmfs
is
currently
engaged
in
consultations
with
other
federal
agencies
and
will
continue
this
process
to
determine
whether
federal
actions
affect
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
section
10
of
the
esa
provides
for
addressing
the
effects
of
private
and
state
(
nonfederal
federal
)
actions
on
endangered
species
.
nmfs
has
worked
with
gcid
to
address
the
impacts
of
their
major
diversion
facility
on
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
through
this
process
.
nmfs
also
expects
to
work
with
the
cdfg
to
address
potentially
adverse
effects
of
striped
bass
and
salmon
hatchery
management
on
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
in
the
future
,
nmfs
will
continue
to
pursue
opportunities
to
remedy
private
and
nonfederal
federal
activities
that
may
affect
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
through
this
process
.
in
1992
,
nmfs
established
a
national
sacramento
river
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
recovery
team
to
develop
a
recovery
plan
for
the
species
.
the
team
is
comprised
of
fishery
resource
managers
,
experts
on
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
biology
and
,
other
conservation
specialists
.
the
recovery
team
meets
frequently
and
expects
to
complete
development
of
a
comprehensive
draft
recovery
plan
in
1994
.
critical

of
the
esa
requires
that
,
to
the
extent
that
it
is
prudent
and
determinable
,
critical

be
designated
concurrently
with
the
listing
of

.
nmfs
published
a
final
rule
designating
critical

for
sacramento

on
06/16/1993
.
the
designated
critical

includes
:
the
