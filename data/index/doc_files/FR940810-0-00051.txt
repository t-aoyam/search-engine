was
oshas
belief
that

primarily
determined

based
on
the
record

,
osha
now
finds
that
these
are
relevant
,
but
not

factors

osha
finds
also
that

of

regarded

this

,
osha
proposed

in

to

involved

even
for
these

a
temporal

was
difficult
to
define
,
and
the
proposed
definition
contained
numerical
criteria
,
which
varied
depending
on
which

was
defined
.
in
addition
,
it
proposed
to
exempt
other

many
objections
to
the
proposed

were
received
by
the

after
reviewing

in

of
the
variety
of

osha
determined
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
use
that

equivalent

once
osha
decided
to
include

two
