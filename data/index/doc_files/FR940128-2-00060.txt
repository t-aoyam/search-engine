summary
:
the
naval
nuclear
propulsion
program
has
prepared
an
environmental
assessment
of
shortterm
short
term
storage
of
naval
spent
nuclear
fuel
.
the
preferred
alternative
is
the
`
no
action
'
alternative
.
naval
spent
fuel
removed
from
nuclear
powered
ships
would
be
retained
in
shipping
containers
at
five
shipyards
:
portsmouth
naval
shipyard
in
kittery
,
maine
;
norfolk
naval
shipyard
in

;

naval
shipyard
in
bremerton
,
washington
;
and
pearl

naval
shipyard
in
pearl

,

.
naval
spent
fuel
also
would
remain
in

.
the
department
of
energy
(
doe
,
with
the
navy
as
a
cooperating
agency
,
is
preparing
an
environmental
impact
statement
on
longerterm
longer
term
storage
of
all
doe
spent
fuel
,
including
naval
spent
fuel
.
the
time
period
evaluated
in
the
shortterm
short
term
storage
environmental
assessment
is
the
period
through
implementation
of
the
record
of
decision
for
the
doe
environmental
impact
statement
.
the
environmental
assessment
discusses
alternatives
to
the
preferred
alternative
and
evaluates
the
environmental
impacts
of
both
the
preferred
and
other
alternatives
.
the
environmental
assessment
concludes
that
the
environmental
impact
of
any
of
the
alternatives
would
be
very
small
.
therefore
,
there
is
no
basis
for
determining
that
any
of
these
alternatives
would
be
environmentally
preferable
to
the
others
.
the
no
action
alternative
,
which
is
the
preferred
alternative
,
would
allow
all
shipyard
work
,
including
refueling
and
defueling
of
nuclear
powered
ships
,
to
continue
unimpeded
by
the
shortterm
short
term
accumulation
of
naval
spent
fuel
.
the
naval
nuclear
propulsion
program
provided
a
draft
of
this
environmental
assessment
to
officials
of
virginia
,
maine
,
new
hampshire
,
washington
,
and
hawaii
for
review
and
comment
.
letters
were
received
from
congressman
norm
dicks
of
washington
and
mr
.
tr
.
strong
of
the
state
of
washington
department
of
health
,
both
of
whom
agreed
that
the
no
action
alternative
is
appropriate
,
and
mr
.
brian
choy
of
the
state
of
hawaii
office
of
environmental
quality
control
,
who
had
no
comment
.
mr
.
strong
suggested
that
the
navy
and
the
state
of
washington
collaborate
in
monitoring
of
radiation
levels
in
the
vicinity
of
puget
sound
naval
shipyard
and
share
results
of
past
radiation
monitoring
.
the
program
agreed
with
these
suggestions
.
mr
.
strong
also
suggested
that
the
navy
proactively
pro
actively
inform
the
public
of
its
plans
,
emphasizing
that
this
is
a
shortterm
short
term
measure
,
and
not
in
consideration
as
a
longterm
long
term
solution
.
in
the
letters
seeking
state
comments
on
the
environmental
assessment
,
the
navy
stated
that
if
the
environmental
assessment
justified
a
finding
of
no
significant
impact
,
the
navy
would
make
the
finding
available
for
public
review
prior
to
a
final
determination
.
accordingly
,
the
program
is
making
this
finding
and
the
environmental
assessment
available
to
state
and
local
officials
,
the
news
media
,
and
the
public
for
a
30
day
comment
period
.
the
environmental
assessment
on
shortterm
short
term
storage
of
naval
spent
fuel
evaluates
shortterm
short
term
storage
only
,
and
the
finding
of
no
significant
impact
would
only
cover
shortterm
short
term
storage
.
however
,
it
should
be
noted
that
longterm
long
term
storage
at
shipyards
is
one
of
the
alternatives
being
considered
for
naval
spent
fuel
in
a
separate
environmental
impact
statement
which
doe
is
preparing
with
navy
assistance
on
spent
fuel
management
.
based
on
the
analysis
in
the
environmental
assessment
,
the
naval
nuclear
propulsion
program
considers
that
the
preferred
alternative
is
not
a
major
federal
action
significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
the
human
environment
,
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act
of
1969

in
accordance
with
the
council
on
environmental
quality
regulations
which
allow
agencies
to
determine
circumstances
under
which
public
review
of
findings
of
no
significant
impact
are
appropriate
,
the
program
is
making
this
finding
available
for
public
comment
for
a
period
of
30
days
following
the
date
of
federal
