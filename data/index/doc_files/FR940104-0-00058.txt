the

analysis
was
structured
so
that
the

the
basic

one

high

to

epa
disagrees
and
believes
it
is
appropriate
to
consider
the
consumption
rate
of
the
entire
population
in
estimating
risk
to
the
general
population
from
this
exposure
pathway
.
however
,
an
adjustment
of
04
was
made
to
the
diet
fraction
to
account
for
the
fact
that
not
all
fish
are
contaminated
.
thus
,
only
some
percentage
of
the
population
would
be
affected
by
the
contaminated
fish
.
as
discussed
in
the
risk
assessment
background
document
for
the
proposed
rule
,
the
04
diet
fraction
was
derived
by
estimating
the
percentage
of
rivers
and
streams
(
ie
,
cataloguing
units
)
that
have
at
least
one
sawmill
.
a
second
adjustment
was
made
in
the
calculation
of
population
risk
to
account
for
the
percentage
of
sawmills
that
operate
surface
protection
processes
(
about
30

of
the

number
of

population
risk
for
the
fish
shellfish
ingestion
scenario
has
been
recalculated
for
the
final
rule
using
the
corrected
incremental
storage
yard
soil
tcddteq
tcdd
teq
concentrations
.
the
corrected
estimate
of
incremental
population
risk
from
crosscontamination
cross
contamination
is
three
orders
of
magnitude
lower
than
the
risk
originally
stated
in
the
proposed
rule
.
the
corrected
number
of
cancer
cases
expected
in
70
years
is
now
0
0002
.
one
commenter
asserted
that
the
soil
ingestion
scenario
was
overly
conservative
because
all
of
the
soil
consumption
was
attributed
to
contaminated
storage
yard
soil
and
no
consumption
of
`
indoor
dust
'
was
considered
.
epa
considered
only
the
consumption
of
storage
yard
soil
in
order
to
be
protective
of
human
health
.
the
range
of
soil
ingestion
rates
for
average
children
aged
1
through
6
is
presented
in
the
epas
exposure
factors
handbook
(
1990
)
as
02
to
08
grams
per
day
.
these
estimated
values
were
determined
from
the
clay
content
of
fecal
samples
taken
from
children
in
this
age
group
and
thus
represent
consumption
of
soil
.
however
,
the
percent
of
this
consumption
that
is
attributed
to
house
dust
is
unknown
,
as
is
the
contaminant
concentration
in
the
house
dust
.
the
epa
has
recalculated
the
soil
ingestion
scenario
using
the
corrected
incremental
tcddteq
tcdd
teq
concentrations
obtained
from
the
formulation
sample
.
the
incremental
risk
estimated
is
below
1e6
,
using
the
conservative
assumptions
.
the
agencys
risk
levels
are
particularly
protective
with
the
use
of
these
conservative
assumptions
,
thereby
further
lending
support
to
the
agencys
decision
not
to
list
these
wastes
.
