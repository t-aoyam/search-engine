basis
for
intended
deletion
of
the
radium
chemical
company
site
the
radium
chemical
company
(
rcc
)
site
is
located
at
6006
27th
avenue
in
woodside
,
queens
county
,
new
york
,
in
a
light
industrial
residential
sector
.
the
site
consisted
of
a
1story
story
brick
building
(
and
a
part
of
a
second
brick
building
which
shared
a
wall
with
this
building
)
bordered
on
the
west
by
27th
avenue
and
on
the
east
by
the

(

,
a
major
roadway
into
new
york
city
.
founded
in
new
york
in
1913
,
rcc
initially
produced
luminous
paint
for
watch
dials
and
instruments
.
later
,
the
company
manufactured
,
leased
and
sold
radium226
radium
in
the
form
of
implant
sources
to
hospitals
,
medical
centers
,
and
research
laboratories
.
in
the
late
1950s
,
rcc
transferred
its
operations
to
the
present
location
in
woodside
,
new
york
.
the
radium
and
radon
devices
were
stored
onsite
on
site
in
lead
containers
in
a
brick
vault
room
.
eventually
the
demand
for
radium
sources
lagged
as
they
were
replaced
with
advanced
radiotherapy
techniques
using
cesium
and
cobalt
sources
.
subsequently
,
many
leased
radium
sources
were
returned
to
rcc
and
were
stored
onsite
on
site
.
in
1983
,
the
state
of
new
york
suspended
the
rcc
operating
license
due
to
various
disposal
and
safety
infractions
.
rcc
attempted
to
obtain
permission
to
begin
operations
again
in
1986
,
but
was
denied
.
the
new
york
state
department
of
labor
issued
its
first
stipulation
and
order
against
rcc
on
10/17/1987
,
for
the
removal
of
the
radium
sources
and
decontamination
of
the
building
.
the
owner
was
unable
to
finance
the
remediation
and
,
subsequently
,
abandoned
the
building
.
this
resulted
in
a
second
stipulation
and
order
,
issued
on
07/20/1988
,
determining
that
the
facility
could
not
be
maintained
and
that
it
was
de
facto
abandoned
by
rcc
.
remaining
onsite
on
site
were
a
large
number
of
radiumcontaining
radium
containing
sealed
devices
,
some
of
which
were
suspected
of
releasing
radium
and

the

radium
at
the
site
was
established
to
be

also
onsite
on

(

undertook
a
limited
emergency
removal
action
under

,
to
secure
the
facility
and
remove
the
radioactive
sources
.
epa
provided

security
and
initiated
measures
to
stabilize
the
site
.
by

,
epa
had
erected

perimeter
and
installed

to
remove
the
radium
sources
and
other
hazardous
materials
from
the
site
and
transport
them
to
approved
disposal
facilities
.
the
removal
action
was
completed
in

approximately
120

of
radium
in
the
form
of

,
contaminated

,
and
loose

and
luminous

were
removed

issued
a
public
health
advisory
to
alert
the
public
,
epa
,
and
the
state
of

of
a
serious
threat
to

,
based
on

from

in

special

epa
proposed
the

for
the

based
on
the
atsdr
advisory
.
on
11/21/1989
,
the
rcc
site
was
added
to
the
national
priorities
list
.
epa
completed
a
focused
feasibility
study
(
ffs
)
of
the
site
in
04/19/1990
.
excessive
levels
of
rn222
and
ra226
remained
in
the
rcc
facility
,
along
with
various
radium
contaminated
hazardous
chemicals
.
on
06/21/1990
,
epa
signed
a
record
of
decision
(
rod
)
selecting
a
remedy
for
the
rcc
site
.
the
rod
called
for
the
following
remedial
activities
at
the
site
:
decontamination
of
the
rcc
facility
;
dismantlement
of
the
rcc
building
;
excavation
of
contaminated
soils
and
subsurface
structures
;
and
transport
and
disposal
of
wastes
to
an

activities
at
the
site
included
a
public
meeting
in
05/19/1990
to
present
the
results
of
the
ffs
and
the
preferred
alternative
for
remediation
of
the
site
.
all
public
comments
received
were
addressed
.
a
major
concern
of
the
public
was
the
disruption
to
the
local
businesses
caused
by
street
closings
.
epa
held
subsequent
meetings
with
the
local

owners
to
determine
