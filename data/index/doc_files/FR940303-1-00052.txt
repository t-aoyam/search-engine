tentative
position
:
protein
and

contents
.
fsis
is
considering
whether
there
is
a
need
to
establish
minimum
protein
and
or
maximum
fat
contents
)
for
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
.
fsis
has
concluded
that
such
action
is
not
necessary
because
protein
and
fat
are
nutrients
whose
declaration
becomes
mandatory
on
the
labeling
of
most
multiingredient
ingredient
meat
and
poultry
products
upon
the
effective
date
of
the
nutrition
labeling
regulations
(
58
fr
632
.
these
regulations
also
establish
a
voluntary
nutrition
labeling
program
for
singleingredient
single
ingredient
,
raw
products
,
and
specify
that
fsis
will
evaluate
significant
participation
of
the
voluntary
program
.
if
significant
participation
is
not
found
,
fsis
shall
initiate
rulemaking
to
require
nutrition
labeling
on
those
products
under
the
voluntary
program
.
therefore
,
with
certain
exceptions
,
consumers
will
have
complete
information
about
the
nutrients
in
poultry
products
.
fsis
recognizes
that
not
all
products
sold
to
consumers
at
the
retail
level
will
carry
nutrition
labeling
.
fsiss
final
regulation
on
nutrition
labeling
provided
for
certain
exceptions
including
products
produced
by
small
businesses
and
products
in
small
packages
of
less
than
1/2
ounce
net
weight
,
provided
that
the
labels
for
these
products
bear
no
nutrition
claims
or
nutrition
information
.
however
,
labeling
will
be
required
on
most
processed
products
purchased
by
consumers
in
retail
stores
so
that
,
together
with
the
voluntary
program
for
retail
store
information
on
singleingredient
single
ingredient
raw
products
,
consumers
will
have
information
on
protein
and
fat
for
most
products
purchased
for
consumption
at
home
.
based
on
these
considerations
,
fsis
maintains
that
there
is
no
need
to
establish
minimum
protein
and
or
maximum

for
boneless

produced
by

tentative
position
:
quality
control
.
fsis
believes
that
a
quality
control
program
is
necessary
to
assure
that
establishments
that
manufacture
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
comply
consistently
with
the
criteria
being
considered
.
utilization
of
such
a
quality
control
program
in
producing
the
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
would
be
a
prerequisite
for
the
approval
of
labels
for
products
consisting
of
or
containing
boneless
poultry
.
the
function
of
a
quality
control
program
is
to
restrict
potential
variability
within
the
limits
of
fsiss
tentative
requirements
by
controlling
the
factors
that
can
affect
the
resulting
products
characteristics
.
fsis
expects
to
require
that
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
be
produced
under
an
approved
quality
control
program
.
also
,
fsis
expects
to
require
that
the
quality
control
program
provide
the
controls
and
information
necessary
to
assure
boneless
poultry
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
will
meet
each
of
the
requirements
under
consideration
and
will
enable
establishment
personnel
and
fsis
to
monitor
it
for
effectiveness
.
fsis
is
focusing
on
methods
that
will
minimize
interlot
lot
variation
by
maintaining
the
uniformity
of
starting
materials
and
controlling
the
handling
and
processing
of
starting
materials
and
resulting
product
.
because
it
appears
that
this
goal
can
be
achieved
effectively
and
efficiently
where
a
program
for
quality
control
incorporates
appropriate
methods
and
monitoring
techniques
and
adheres
to
good
manufacturing
practices
,
fsis
plans
to
require
that
an
establishment
conduct
only
limited
analyses
for
calcium
,
protein
quality
,
and
bone
particles
for
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
to
confirm
that
production
is
,
in
fact
,
under
control
.
after
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
the
quality
control
program
is
able
to
yield
complying
product
,
confirmatory
analyses
would
be
required
only
periodically
,
as
long
as
the
product
is
in
compliance
.
fsis
anticipates
establishing
basic
parameters
for
the
chemical
analyses
that
must
be
performed
to
verify
compliance
with
the
requirements
,
eg
,
defining
production
lots
and
sampling
schedules
,
and
the
accepted
methodology
for
performing
analyses
.
fsis
wishes
to
receive
comments
on
the
parameters
necessary
for
an
adequate
quality
control
program
.

however
,
because
the
mechanical
deboning
process
presents
greater
opportunities
for

growth
than
traditional
poultry

,
fsis
is
considering
amending
the

to
more
specifically
address
the
requirements
for

used
to
