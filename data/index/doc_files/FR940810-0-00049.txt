a
major
reason
for
this
approach
for
construction
and
shipyards
is
that
measured
levels
of
exposure
often
fail
to
define
risk
and
are
often
not
received
before
the
work
is
completed
.
this
was
partly
explained
in
the
proposal
.
there
osha
noted
that
for
removal
jobs
,
highly
variable
amounts
of
asbestos
are
generated
,
`
reducing
the
predictability
of
exposure
levels
from
one
monitoring
event
to
the
next
.
moreover
,
measured
asbestos
levels
often
cannot
be
used
to
determine
the
need
for
(
specific
controls
)
.
.
.
.
.
.
because
of
the
time
required
by
the
laboratory
to
complete
the
test
and
report
the
results
'
(

at

.
thus
,
it
would
be
unproductive
to
leave
employees
unprotected
while
initial
monitoring
results
are
being
analyzed
;
and
in
many
cases
,
even
prompt
reporting
of
exposure
levels
during
the
setting
up
of
the
controls
would
not
predict
exposures
during
the
actual
removal
.
a
significant
risk
remains
at
the
pel
of
01
f
cc
,
and
it
is
feasible
to
attain
lower
levels
for
some
workers
exposed
to
asbestos
.
osha
has
therefore
considered
whether
to
establish
different
pels
for
different
operations
based
on
the
lowest
exposure
limits
that
can
feasibly
be
achieved
in
those
operations
and
that
are
needed
to
eliminate
significant
risk
.
osha
has
decided
not
to
do
so
because
the
operationspecific
operation
specific
work
practices
mandated
in
the
standard
will
be
a
most
costeffective
cost
effective
means
of
assuring
that
significant
risk
is
eliminated
to
the
extent
feasible
.
asbestos
has
been
the
subject
of
extensive
rulemaking
by
osha
and
other
agencies
,
and
the
operations
that
expose
employees
to
asbestos
are
well
known
and
thoroughly
studied
.
moreover
,
given
the
shift
away
from
asbestos
products
wherever
substitutes
are
available
,
it
appears
unlikely
that
major
new
uses
will
be
found
for
asbestos
in
the
future
.
osha
has
therefore
been
able
to
focus
its
rulemaking
effort
on
evaluating
the
work
practices
that
will
best
reduce
asbestos
exposures
in
the
specific
operations
that
expose
workers
to
asbestos
.
the
result
is
a
standard
that
relies
heavily
on
mandated
work
practices
that
will
,
in
most
situations
,
result
in
employee
exposure
well
below
the
pel
.
in
effect
,
the
mandated
work
practices
will
assure
that
each
asbestos
worker
is
exposed
to
the
lowest
feasible
level
for
the
operation
in
which
that
worker
is
engaged
.
this
approach
was
taken
in
the
1986
construction
standard
.
there
,
osha
`
tiered
'
its
construction
standard
`
to
apply
increasingly
stringent
requirements
to
those
work
operations
associated
with
the
highest
exposures
'
(
51
fr
at
23706
.
rather
than
two
classifications
as
in
1986
(
smallscale
small
scale
and
abatement
work
,
osha
now
divides
construction
work
into
four
classes
and
has
made
additional
limited
distinctions
based
on
measurable
variables
such
as
amount
of
material
disturbed
.
since
oshas
approach
assures
that
each
employee
is
exposed
to
the
lowest
feasible
level
of
asbestos
,
no
additional
protection
would
be
gained
by
establishing
a
series
of
different
pels
for
different
operations
.
such
an
approach
would
add
cost
and
complexity
to
employers
'
compliance
duties
and
to
oshas
enforcement
duties
without
benefiting
worker
health
.
pels
lower
than
01
f
cc
would
be
particularly
unsuitable
as
compliance
criteria
because
it
is
difficult
to
reliably
measure
lower
levels
.
because
such
measurements
are
unreliable
,
if
lower
pels
were
established
,
measurements
taken
by
employers
and
by
osha
would
provide
an
uncertain
basis
for
determining
whether
employers
have
fulfilled
their
compliance
duties
.
however
,
both
employers
and
osha
can
easily
determine
whether
the
work
practices
prescribed
in
the
standard
are
being
followed
.
the
mandated
work
practices
thus
assure
that
employees
are
better
protected
than
a
series
of
different
pels
while
reducing
compliance
burdens
on
employers
and
easing
the
agencys
enforcement
burden
.
therefore
,
rather
than
set
operationspecific
operation
specific
permissible
exposure
limits
,
osha
proposed
to
further
reduce
risk
by
requiring
certain
additional
work
practices
.
the
operations
for
which
mandatory
work
practices
are
required
would
otherwise
result
in
employee
exposure
that
is
significant
.
osha
believes
that
these
controls
are
feasible
,
reasonable
,
and
necessary
.
