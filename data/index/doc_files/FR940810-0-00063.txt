,
oshas
decision
to
reduce
the
pel
across
the
board
responds
to
the
courts
directive
to
consider
whether
to
establish
operationspecific

specific
exposure

,
since
the
court
noted
that
on
the
record
of
the
1986
standards
,
it
appeared
feasible
to
reduce
the
pel
to
01
f
cc
limit
in
many
industry
sectors
.
osha
has
rejected
`

the
wide

of

that
expose
employees
to

osha

will
be
at

as
great
as

the
required

are
found
to
be
capable
of
achieving

on
an

operation
by

basis
.
second
,
since
osha
has
found
that
specific
work
practices
are
feasible
,
the
agency
expects
a
higher
compliance
rate
and
thus
,
greater
risk
reduction
than
if
practices
were
not
specified
.
third
,
in
operations
where
particular
controls
are
specified
,
the
pel
is
a
backstop
;
alerting
employers
where
additional
controls
are
needed
or
closer
surveillance
is
required
;
in
all
operations
the
pel
is
a
measurable
and
comparable
value
,
which
cannot
be
exceeded
without
further
action
by
the
employer
to
reduce
exposures
.
at
the
time
of
the
proposal
in
1990
,
the
question
of
whether
the
proposed

reduction
would
reduce
a
still
significant

had
already
been
given
a
tentative
answer
by

in

noted
that
based
on
the
1984
risk
assessment
,
the
excess

stemming
from

in

osha
stated
that
it

amendments
to
reduce
the
pel
to
01

as
a

would
further

(

oshas
1984
risk
assessment
showed
that
lowering
the
twa
pel
from
2
f

to
02

reduced
the
asbestos
cancer
mortality
risk
from
lifetime
exposure
from
64
to
67
deaths
per
1000
workers
.
osha
estimated
that
the
incidence
of
asbestosis
would
be
5
cases
per
1000
workers
exposed
for
a
working
lifetime
under
the
twa

counterpart
risk
figures
for
20
years
of
exposure
are
excess
cancer
risks
of
45
per
1000
workers
and
an
estimated
asbestosis
incidence
of
2
cases
per
1000
workers
.
oshas
risk
assessment
also
showed
that
reducing
exposure
to
01
f
cc
would
further
reduce
,
but
not
eliminate
,
significant
risk
.
the
excess
cancer
risk
at
that
level
would
be
reduced
to
a
lifetime
risk
of
34
per
1000
workers
and
a
20
year
exposure
risk
of
23
per
1000
workers
.
consequently
significant
risk
would
be
reduced
substantially
.
however
,
osha
concluded
therefore
that
continued
exposure
to
asbestos
at
the
twa
permitted
level
and
action
level
would
still
present
residual
risks
to
employees
which
are
significant
.
the
court
did
not
ask
and
osha
did
not
undertake
to
review
its
earlier
risk
assessment
in
the
proposal
.
at
the
hearing
in

mr

asked
by

if

was

.
mr

stated
that
`
a

suggested
to

that

is
outdated

mr

responded
that
`

other
parties
questioned
oshas
continuing
reliance
on
the
1984
risk
assessment
.
the
asbestos
information
association
(
aiana
)
testified
that
`
oshas
1984
risk
assessment
fails
to
take
into
account
the
scientific
communitys
consensus
that
chrysotile
exposures
hold
lower
risk
than
the
agency
estimates
*
*

*
we
do
not
believe
that
the
risk
assessment
that
is
six
years
old
relies
on
the
best
available
evidence
'
aiana
requested
osha
to
convene
experts
,
as
part
of
this
hearing
process
`
to
revise
its
asbestos
risk
assessment

this
was
