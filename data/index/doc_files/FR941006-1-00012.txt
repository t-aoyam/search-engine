introduction
and
background
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
(
sec
'
or
`
commission
)
today
is
proposing
a
rule
(
17
cfr
240
15c5
)
to
prohibit
market
makers
in
nasdaq
national
market
system
(
nasdaq
nms
)
securities
from
trading
ahead
of
customer
orders
that
they
are
holding
at
the
same
or
better
price
.
the
commission
is
proposing
to
change
existing
practices
because
it
believes
this
will
enhance
brokerdealer
broker
dealer
competition
,
promote
efficient
pricing
of
securities
,
facilitate
best
execution
of
customer
orders
and
better
reflect
investor
expectations
in
the
nasdaq
nms
market
.
the
growth
of
the
nasdaq
market
and
the
concomitant
visibility
of
and
investor
interest
in
its
companies
has
changed
investors
'
expectations
.
in
designing
the
proposed
rule
,
the
commission
has
been
mindful
of
the
special
role
of
nasdaq
market
makers
in
discovering
prices
and
providing
liquidity
in
nasdaq
nms
stocks
.
the
proposal
seeks
comment
on
specific
trading
standards
that
would
govern
individual
market
makers
.
the
proposed
rule
is
intended
to
have
the
effect
of
giving
priority
to
orders
that
improve
the
market
(
(
ie
.
,
,
narrow
the
bidask
bid
ask
spread
)
being
made
by
a
specific
market
maker
.
generally
,
an
order
to
buy
or
sell
a
security
at
a
specified
price
(
limit
order
)
is
first
received
by
the
customers
broker
,
who
either
routes
the
order
to
an
affiliated
or
nonaffiliated
affiliated
market
maker
for
execution
or
,
if
the
firm
is
itself
a
market
maker
in
the
security
,
to
the
firms
market
making
desk
.
the
combination
of
limit
order
execution
and
market
maker
functions
can
lead
to
the
market
maker
competing
with
a
customer
for
executions
.
while
the
past
few
years
have
seen
several
positive
efforts
at
improving
limit
order
handling
practices
in
the
nasdaq
market
,
the
commission
believes
that
it
should
consider
a
limit
order
priority
rule
to
ensure
protection
for
all
customer
orders
in
this
market
.
the
priority
accorded
a
customer
limit
order
today
is
different
depending
on
the
structure
of
the
marketplace
of
execution
.
the
rules
of
national
securities
exchanges
generally
require
specialists
and
other
market
professionals
to
yield
to
a
customers
limit
order
;
the
specialist
cannot
trade
for
its
own
account
at
prices
equal
to
or
better
than
the
limit
order
until
the
limit
order
is
executed
.
the
rules
of
the
national
association
of
securities
dealers
(
nasd
)
similarly
prohibit
third
market
makers
(
overthecounter
the
counter
market
makers
in
listed
securities
)
from
trading
ahead
of
customer
limit
orders
in
the
third
market
.

the
priority
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
do
permit
an
exception
to
this
general
principle
for
prearranged
arranged
crosses
of
25000
shares
or
more
.
such
a
cross
may
be
executed
on
the
floor
without
interacting
with
preexisting
existing
limit
orders
at
the
same
price
.
a
preexisting
limit
order
,
however
,
may
interact
with
the
buyer
or
seller
in
the
cross
if
it
provides
a
price
that
is
better
than
the
proposed
cross
price
