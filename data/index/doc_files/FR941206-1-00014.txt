limitations
on
use
.
in
the
03/19/1994
,
anpr
,
fsis
tentatively
proposed
that
,
in
certain
cases
,
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
should
be
restricted
from
use
as
an
ingredient
in
other
products
.
it
was
considered
that
imposing
such
restrictions
was
necessary
for
mechanically
separated
poultry
because
of
the
potential
fluoride
contribution
of
mechanically
separated
poultry
made
from
fowl
(
ie
,
mature
female
chickens
.
it
was
also
tentatively
suggested
that
use
restrictions
for
all
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
be
considered
(
ie
,
any
product
with
bone
solids
not
greater
than
1
percent
)
based
on
the
characteristics
of
such
product
,
including
the
kind
of
poultry
from
which
it
is
made
,
and
its
consistency
.
thirteen
commenters
addressed
the
issue
of
limitation
on
use
of
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
,
in
general
,
as
an
ingredient
in
other
products
.
twelve
of
the
commenters
disagreed
with
the
general
premise
of
establishing
any
use
limitations
on
mechanically
separated
poultry
products
because
there
are
no
safety
or
health
concerns
regarding
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
.
the
commenters
also
stated
that
the
marketplace
is
a
much
better
judge
of
quality
(
ie
,
use
levels
of
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
)
than
fsis
.
fsis
believes
that
poultry
products
that
are
mechanically
separated
should
not
be
used
in
poultry
products
that
are
represented
as
being
composed
of
whole
poultry
muscle
,
other
than
where
it
is
used
as
a
binding
agent
(
ie
,
a
substance
that
holds
muscle
pieces
together
)
at
a
level
that
is
sufficient
for
this
purpose
.
when
used
as
a
binder
,
it
is
fsis
'
belief
that
,
without
the
declaration
of
mechanically
separated
poultry
as
an
ingredient
on
the
labels
of
the
poultry
and
meat
food
products
that
purport
to
be
intact
,
whole
muscle
products
,
the
labels
of
such
products
would
be
misbranded
.
it
is
poultry
meat
,
particularly
muscles
,
that
characterizes
parts
and
cuts
of
poultry
.
the
physical
and
sensory
characteristics
(
ie
,
mouthfeel
,
texture
,
color
)
associated
with
a
part
or
cut
of
poultry
can
be
retained
when
trimmings
removed
during
processing
are
reincorporated
;
and
the
characteristics
associated
with
the
cut
remains
when
there
is
chunking
,
chopping
,
or
grinding
of
the
muscle
as
in
versions
of
turkey
ham
product
(
9
cfr
381
171
.
fsis
regards
these
processes
as
different
than
using
product
made
by
the
mechanical
separation
of
bones
with
attached
poultry
tissue
.
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
does
not
,
in
fsis
'
view
,
retain
the
characteristics
of
the
cuts
themselves
.
it
appears
inconsistent
with
the
basic
characteristics
expected
of
products
represented
as
having
been
made
from
a
particular
part
or
cut
of
the
poultry
carcass
,
to
include
this
finely
comminuted
ingredient
,
especially
when
the
muscle
from
that
part
is
essentially
intact
or
has
been
processed
only
to
the
extent
of
cutting
or
grinding
.
therefore
,
fsis
continues
to
support
its
tentative
position
stated
in
the
03/19/1994
anpr
that
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
not
be
permitted
in
products
expected
to
be
composed
of
whole
muscle
or
pieces
of
muscle
,
eg
,
`
kind
)
steak
or
(
kind
)
fillet
'
(

.
fsis
agrees
with
commenters
that
,
except
for
the
potential
health
effects
associated
with
the
fluoride
content
of
mechanically
separated
chicken
from
fowl
,
there
are
no
health
and
safety
concerns
regarding
the
use
of
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
.
issues
raised
in
the
past
concerning
cholesterol
and
calcium
content
are
addressed
by
the
requirements
of
the
new
nutrition
labeling
.
calcium
and
cholesterol
contents
of
most
foods
will
be
required
as
part
of
the
nutrition
label
.
however
,
fsis
continues
to
support
its
consideration
,
as
stated
in
the
03/19/1994
anpr
,
that
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
,
ie
,
any
such
product
with
no
greater
than
1
percent
bone
solids
,
made
,
in
whole
or
in
part
,
from
fowl
(
ie
,
mature
female
chickens
,
as
defined
in
9
cfr
381
170
)
not
be
permitted
in
baby
,
junior
,
or
toddler
foods
.
the
basis
for
this
is
that
the
fluoride
content
associated
with
mechanically
separated
chicken
made
from
fowl
has
potential
health
implications
.
there
were
no
data
submitted
in
response
to
the
anpr
to
support
opposition
to
this
aspect
of
use
limitations
for
mechanically
separated
poultry
.
