as
a
general
response
to
the
comments
on
bone
solids
content
and
labeling
,
fsis
first
reiterates
its
reasons
for
having
considered
in
the
03/19/1994
anpr
the
defining
of
a
product
standard
for
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
based
,
in
part
,
on
percent
bone
solids
content
.
in
1969
,
the
agency
promulgated
rules
on
deboned
poultry
products
specifying
that
no
more
than
1
percent
bone
solids
content
would
be
allowed
for
this
product
.
as
indicated
previously
,
this
decision
was
based
on
the
agencys
careful
appraisal
of
the
operating
results
in
a
series
of
poultry
establishments
that
used
mechanical
deboning
equipment
.
analyses
were
made
of
485
samples
of
raw
,
mechanically
deboned
products
from
nine
commercial
operations
,
representing
three
makes
of
machines
most
often
used
in
this
process
.
the
analyses
demonstrated
that
it
is
practical
and
acceptable
to
limit
the
bone
`
residue
'
in
mechanically
deboned
poultry
and
that
the
equipment
for
manufacturing
such
product
can
be
operated
under
commercial
conditions
to
produce
poultry
product
that
contains
no
more
than
1
percent
of
bone
.
this
provision
of
the
1969
amendments
was
promulgated
to
assure
that
deboned
poultry
products
are
wholesome
in
accordance
with
the
poultry
products
inspection
act
.
also
,
it
is
important
to
note
that
at
the
time
of
the
1969
regulation
,
the
mechanical
separation
process
was
new
and
fsis
had
limited
information
concerning
the
consequences
of
it
.
fsis
conducted
extensive
studies
on
mechanically
deboned
poultry
products
during
the
1970s
and
monitored
the
technology
improvements
during
the
1980s
.
the
results
of
these
studies
and
the
information
considered
during
rulemakings
,
or
other
documents
considering
the
need
for
rulemaking
,
regarding
poultry
and
livestock
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
over
the
past
2
decades
have
shown
that
there
are
differences
between
the
mechanically
deboned
product
and
traditionally
deboned
products
(
ie
,
handdeboned
hand
deboned
.
the
principal
characteristics
that
distinguish
mechanically
separated
poultry
product
and
boneless
poultry
produced
by
traditional
methods
are
bone
solids
content
,
and
its
physical
form
and
consistency
.
informing
consumers
of
such
differences
via
the
distinct
labeling
of
the
presence
of
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
means
is
supported
by
the
statutory
responsibility
of
fsis
to
assure
that
all
labels
on
poultry
and
meat
food
products
are
not
false
or
misleading
.
fsis
received
comments
that
expressed
this
sentiment
in
response
to
its
solicitations
for
public
input
in
the
06/19/1993
anpr
and
the
03/19/1994
anpr
.
in
the
03/19/1994
anpr
,
fsis
suggested
that
,
because
of
the
differences
in
percent
bone
solids
content
among
mechanically
separated
poultry
products
,
which
were
shown
in
the
data
presented
in
the
fsis
report
`
determination
of
acceptable
limits
of
percent
bone
solids
in
ground
poultry
products
'
the
agency
would
regulate
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
so
that
producers
of
a
product
with
a
low
percent
bone
solids
content
that
met
the
established
limitation
would
be
able
to
label
such
products
without
a
reference
to
the
mechanical
means
of
processing
.
in
review
of
the
tentative
approach
presented
in
the
03/19/1994
anpr
and
the
comments
received
in
response
to
this
anpr
and
the
prior
06/15/1993
,
anpr
,
fsis
now
believes
that
the
continuation
of
the
present
labeling
policy
,
even
for
those
finished
products
with
mechanically
separated
poultry
that
has
a
low
bone
solids
contents
,
does
not
inform
the
consumer
that
these
products
contain
mechanically
separated
poultry
as
an
ingredient
and
that
this
may
result
in
misleading
labeling
.
the
statutes
under
which
fsis
operates
provide
the
authority
to
protect
the
public
and
prevent
the
distribution
in
commerce
of
products
that
are
misbranded
and
are
not
properly
marked
,
labeled
,
or
packaged
.
fsis
believes
that
the
labeling
of
poultry
and
meat
food
products
containing
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
as
an
ingredient
must
inform
the
consumer
of
its
contents
,
unless
it
is
clearly
demonstrated
that
any
omitted
information
would
not
mislead
the
consumer
or
otherwise
render
the
product
misbranded
.
this
labeling
position
must
be
adhered
to
consistently
across
all
types
of
poultry
and
meat
food
products
containing
mechanically
separated
poultry
as
an
ingredient
.
