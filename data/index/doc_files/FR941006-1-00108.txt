iron
toxicity
in
young
children
although
the
minimal
toxic
and
lethal
doses
for
iron
have
not
been
clearly
established
(
ref

,
the
severity
of
iron
poisoning
when
an
overdose
has
been
ingested
is
related
to
the
amount
of
iron
absorbed
into
the
circulatory
system
.
experts
have
stated
that
ingestion
of
25
mg
kg
of
iron
(
250
mg
total
iron
for
a
10
kg
child
)
may
produce
symptoms
of
poisoning
,
and
that
ingestion
of
60
mg
kg
total
iron
for
a
10
kg
child
is
the
minimum
intake
for
the
development
of
significant
iron
poisoning
(
refs
.
6
and
7
.
one
source
recommends
emergency
room
evaluation
when
ingestion
of
iron
exceeds
50
mg
kg
(
ref
.
6
.
an
acute
ingestion
of
more
than
250
mg
kg
for
a
10
kg
child
is
typically
considered
a
lethal
dose
for
iron
(
ref

.
however
,
it
has
been
reported
that
ingestion
of
100
to
200
mg
kg
for
a
10
kg
child
can
be
fatal
(

,
and
that
ingestion
of
as
little
as
650
mg
of
iron
(
65
mg
kg
for
a
10
kg
child
)
has
resulted
in
death
(
ref

.
based
upon
these
reported
values
,
acute
ingestions
of
less
than
1000
mg
of
iron
appear
to
be
likely
to
cause
nonfatal
injuries
of
varying
severity
,
depending
on
the
amount
of
ingested
iron
.
iron
overdose
results
in
both
local
and
systemic
effects
(

.
toxicity
is
caused
by
both
a
direct
corrosive
effect
on
the
gastrointestinal
mucosa
and
the
presence
of
unbound
iron
in
the
circulatory
system
.
locally
in
the
stomach
and
intestine
,
ingested
iron
is
corrosive
and
produces
death
of
cells
in
the
mucosa
lining
the
gastrointestinal
tract
,
resulting
in
ulceration
and
hemorrhage
.
while
intact
mucosa
limits
the
absorption
of
iron
,
eroded
mucosa
permits
absorption
of
relatively
huge
amounts
of
iron
into
the
portal
circulation
that
goes
immediately
to
the
liver
,
causing
damage
to
liver
cells
.
overload
of
the
liver
cells
,
which
normally
remove
iron
from
the
circulation
,
allows
iron
to
enter
the
general
circulation
.
when
the
circulating
iron
exceeds
the
capacity
of
certain
proteins
to
bind
it
,
free
iron
reaches
other
tissues
,
such
as
kidneys
,
lungs
,
heart
and
blood
vessels
,
and
the
brain
.
the
resultant
death
of
cells
in
these
tissues
produces
the
following
widespread
wide
spread
symptoms
and
signs
of
iron
poisoning
:
kidney
failure
,
edema
in
the
lung
,
hemorrhage
,
hypotension
from
damage
to
the
heart
and
blood
vessels
,
coma
from
damage
to
the
brain
,
and
acidosis
from
release
of
organic
acids
.
severe
iron
poisoning
is
characterized
by
four
clinical
stages
(
refs
.
6
and
9
:
(
1
)
stage
one
,
which
may
occur
within
30
minutes
(
min
)
of
ingestion
,
is
characterized
primarily
by
signs
and
symptoms
of
hemorrhagic
gastroenteritis
(
ie
,
nausea
,
vomiting
,
abdominal
pain
,
hematemesis
(
vomiting
blood
,
and
bloody
diarrhea
)
that
may
progress
to
shock
,
coma
,
seizures
,
and
death
.
(

)
during
stage
two
,
which
occurs
from
2
to
12
hours
(
hr
)
after
ingestion
,
patients
may
be
without
symptoms
and
may
appear
to
have
recovered
.
some
children
will
recover
,
but
some
may
progress
to
stage
three
.
the
appearance
of
recovery
should
not
delay
evaluation
and
treatment
for
iron
poisoning
because
successful
treatment
is
difficult
once
the
iron
is
absorbed
from
the
small
intestine
into
the
blood
.
(

)
during
stage
three
,
from
12
to
48
hr
after
ingestion
,
there
is
a
recurrence
of
gastrointestinal
hemorrhage
with
severe
lethargy
or
coma
,
and
there
may
be
liver
and
kidney
failure
and
collapse
of
the
heart
and
blood
vessels
.
(

)
stage
four
,
3
to
4
weeks
after
survivors
of
poisonings
ingested
the
iron
,
may
include
gastrointestinal
obstruction
and
cirrhosis
of
the
liver

an

an

in

may
be
used
to

is
present
