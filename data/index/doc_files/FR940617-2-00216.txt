and
commercial
enterprises

hopes
to
fund

between
organizations

.
epa
hopes

instead
of
deciding
how
to
recycle
,
treat

or
dispose
of
waste
and
pollution
that
has
already
been
created
.
pollution
prevention
may
include
increasing
energy

and
resource
conservation
efforts
,
as
well
as
finding

polluting
substitutes
for
existing

.
pollution
prevention
is
not
the
only
strategy
that
epa
uses
to
reduce
risk
to
public
health
and
the
environment
,
but
it
is
epas
preferred
approach
.
efforts
to
promote
pollution
prevention
through
environmental
education
may
include
projects
that
educate
the
public
about
the
value
of
preventive
approaches
to
environmental
problems
and
the
choices
they
can
make
in
their
everyday
lives
to
minimize
adverse
effects
of
human
activities
on
the
environment
(
eg
,
in
the
home
,
work
place
,
market
place
,
and
or
community
