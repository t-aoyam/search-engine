.
the
topics
addressed
follow

they

raised

securities
to
be
covered
with
regard
to
the
solicitation
of
comments
on
debt
securities
,
those
who
did
comment
recommended
that
rated
debt
securities
,
especially
corporate
debt
securities
,
be
excluded
from
the
interpretation
.
the
commenters
maintained
,
in
general
,
that
the
pricing
of
such
securities
is
made
in
conjunction
with
a
comparison
to
us
.
treasury
securities
,
that
their
price
fluctuates
relative
to
interest
rates
,
and
that
such
securities
are
typically
considered
fungible
by
investors
,
ie
,
investors
look
for
a
certain
grade
of
debt
,
and
do
not
focus
on
the
issuer
,
as
in
equity
offerings
.
thus
,
they
maintained
that
the
abuses
that
the
interpretation
seeks
to
prevent
are
not
evident
in
rated
debt
offerings
,
and
that
the
interpretations
methodology
is
inapplicable
to
the
trading
of
such
securities
.
the
nasd
has
considered
that
it
does
not
typically
bring
enforcement
actions
in
this
area
,
but
has
concluded
that
the
continued
coverage
of
debt
securities
is
warranted
for
purposes
of
deterring
any
potential
future
problems
in
this
area
.
standby
stand
by
arrangements
those
who
commented
generally
supported
the
proposal
.
one
commenter
maintained
that
the
fivemonth
five
month
holding
period
was
too
long
in
that
it
went
beyond
the
period
in
which
the
purchaser
should
be
exposed
to
the
market
risk
for
the
securities
.
it
proposed
a
holding
period
of
no
longer
than
three
months
,
which
it
maintains
is
adequate
time
for
the
market
to
establish
some
equilibrium
for
the
security
.
another
commenter
believed
that
it
is
unclear
to
whom
an
underwriter
has
to
represent
that
it
was
unable
to
find
any
other
purchaser
for
the
securities
,
and
suggested
that
a
representation
in
the
prospectus
should
suffice
.
the
nasd
believes
that
the
various
holding
periods
under
the
interpretation
and
in
the
freeriding
free
riding
provisions
of
schedule
e
to
the
bylaws
by
laws
dealing
with
offerings
by
members
of
their
own
securities
should
be
uniform
and
has
therefore
proposed
a
three
month
holding
period
.
cancellation
of
trades
as
`
safe
harbor
'
one
commenter
believed
that
there
would
not
be
any
implications
under
sec
rule
10b6
for
the
proposed
safe
harbor
so
long
as
the
cancellation
and
reallocation
was
completed
before
settlement
date
.
a
different
commenter
suggested
that
any
concerns
with
rule
10b6
could
be
remedied
by
obtaining
a
noaction
no
action
letter
from
the
sec
.
another
commenter
suggested
that
any
notice
of
cancellations
and
reallocations
would
have
to
be
given
to
the
restricted
purchaser
no
later
than
the
day
after
purchase
,
and
a
further
commenter
maintained
that
the
proposal
was
too
reactive
.
it
suggested
that
the
nasd
establish
a
procedure
where
hot
issues
were
characterized
as
such
before
the
distribution
via
indications
of
interest
,
so
as
to
prevent
sales
to
restricted
accounts
.
the
nasd
notes
that
for
purposes
of
rule
10b6
,
a
distribution
includes
`
the
entire
process
by
which
in
the
course
of
a
public
offering
the
block
of
securities
is
dispensed
and
ultimately
comes
to
rest
in
the
hands
of
the
investing
public
'
thus
,
a
distribution
continues
if
a
brokerdealer
broker
dealer
withholds
any
part
of
an
offering
in
proprietary
or
nominee
accounts
and
later
sells
those
securities
to
the
public
after
secondary
trading
has
begun
.
moreover
,
a
cancellation
of
a
bona
fide
purchase
order
will
not
reopen
the
distribution
where
there
is
no
reason
for
the
underwriter
to
believe
that
the
purchase
order
would
be
cancelled
.
whether
a
particular
cancellation
and
reallocation
for
purposes
of
compliance
with
the
interpretation
will
raise
an
issue
under
rule
10b6
will
depend
upon
the
facts
and
circumstances
involved
in
that
cancellation
and
reallocation
.

immediate
family
those
who
commented
strongly
supported
the
lifting
of
the
immediate
family
restrictions
on
persons
restricted
under
paragraphs
three
and
four
of
the
interpretation
.
one
commenter
expressed
concern
that
the
retention
of
the
immediate
family
restriction
in
connection
with
allocations
by
the
broker
dealer
that
employs
the
restricted
person
(
as
opposed
to
allocations
by
broker
dealers
that
do
not
employ
the
restricted
person
)
creates
a
new
category
of
restricted
persons
that
may
prove
burdensome
for
the
member
who
is
making
the
distribution
.
the
nasd
does
not
believe
that
any
new
restricted
category
is
being
created
and
believes
that
the
proposed
modifications
are
appropriate
.
persons
with
limited
registration
or
limited
purpose
broker
dealers
several
of
the
commenters
supported
the
proposed
exemption
as
described
in
the
notice
.
in
addition
,
virtually
all
proposed
that
the
exemption
be
expanded
to
apply
to
all
persons
,
notwithstanding
their
level
of
registration
,
if
they
are
associated
with
broker
dealers
that
do
a
limited
business
.
they
maintained
generally
that
such
representatives
are
proscribed
from
doing
any
securities
business
which
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
limited
broker
dealers
prescribed
business
(
eg
,
investment
company
securities
,
and
maintained
that
the
potential
for
abuse
by
one
that
has
a
general
license
is
unlikely
.
some
of
the
commenters
contended
that
limited
broker
dealer
representatives
often
have
a
series
7
(
general
securities
representative
)
license
in
order
to
comply
with
state
law
,
and
one
commenter
maintained
that
the
exemption
as
proposed
would
create
a
disincentive
for
persons
with
limited
registrations
from
seeking
further
registration
education
.
various
commenters
believed
that
a
firmbased
firm
based
exemption
should
include
the
firms
listed
in
the
notice
as
well
as
firms
that
do
not
underwrite
or
distribute
initial
public
offerings
,
merger
and
acquisition
boutique
firms
that
do
not
trade
,
and
private
placement
firms
.
