of

epa
defined
the
terms
`
new
or
significantly
improved
'
`
wide
application
'
and
`
a
high
priority
environmental
issue
'
in
`
relative
terms
'
(
ie
,
applicants
must
define
these
terms
as
they
relate
to
their
individual
projects
.
for
example
,
in
reference
to
section
ivn1a
,
epa
may
consider
a
project
new
or
significantly
improved
if
it
reaches
a
specific
community
or
audience
for
the
first
time
,
develops
a
new
or
improved
teaching
strategy
,
or
uses
a
new
or
improved
method
of
applying
existing
materials
.
in
reference
to
section
ivn1b
,
epa
may
consider
a
project
to
have
wide
application
if
it
targets
a
large
and
diverse
audience
in
terms
of
numbers
and
demographics
.
it
may
also
have
wide
application
if
it
can
serve
as
a
model
program
elsewhere
such
as
another
school
,
community
,
state
,
or
region
.
in
reference
to
section
ivn1c
,
epa
may
consider
that
a
project
addresses
a
high
priority
environmental
issue
if
the
applicant
demonstrates
that
a
particular
issue
is
important
to
the
community
,
state
,
or
region
being
targeted
by
the
project
.
for
example
,
one
community
may
have
significant
air
pollution
problems
which
would
make
teaching
about
solutions
to
air
pollution
important
to
that
community
.
in
another
community
,
unplanned
development
may
threaten
a
nearby
wildlife
habitat
,
thus
,
making
habitat
or
ecosystem
protection
a
high
priority
issue
.
in
still
another
community
,
urban
decay
may
make
education
about
lead
poisoning
from
paint
or
lead
pipes
important
,
especially
for
culturally
diverse
or
lowincome

residents
who
