the
term

includes
not
only
manufacturing
and
shipping
time
,
but
also
the
time
from

of
purchase
to

use

thus
,
manufacturers
are
responsible
for
the
manner
in
which
their
products
are
held
pending

consumer
use

and
they
are
responsible
if
the
packaging
that
they
use
is
not
adequate
to
prevent
unintended
ingestion
of

the
regulations
are
replete
with
examples
of

to
regulate
the

this

of
the

manufacturers
also
are

in
1982
,
in
response
to
a
series
of
capsule
tamperings
,
fda
promulgated
a
regulation
(

that
requires
tamperresistant

packaging
for
all

the

assured
greater

security

authority
to
require
tamperresistant
tamper
resistant
packaging

found
primarily
in

)
of
the
act
.
significantly
,
the
health
risk
that
prompted
the
tamperresistant
tamper
resistant
packaging
regulation
was
not
attributable
directly
to
manufacturing
or
packing
practices
that
contravened
the
current
good
manufacturing
practice
regulations
in
effect
at
that
time
.
rather
,
despite
compliance
with
existing
regulations
,
drug
product
quality
was
compromised
because
of
previously
unforeseeable
and
unintended
intervention
by
persons
other
than
the
consumer
.
because
tamper
resistant
packaging
was
a
means
to
obviate
a
newly
apparent
danger
,
and
because
tamperresistant
tamper
resistant
packaging
technology
was
available
,
current
good
manufacturing
practice
mandated
that
it
be
used
.
similarly
,
in
1989
,
recognizing
the
persistent
vulnerability
of
the
hardcapsule
hard
capsule
dosage
form
,
fda
amended
the
tamperresistant
tamper
resistant
regulation
to
require
that
otc
products
marketed
in
twopiece
two
piece
,
hardgelatin
hard
gelatin
capsules
be
packaged
using
at
least
two
tamperresistant
tamper
resistant
features
(

.
likewise
,
in
1994
,
the
agency
proposed
to
amend
the
tamperresistant
tamper
resistant
regulation
to
require
that
the
packages
for
all
otc
human
drug
products
marketed
in
twopiece
two
piece
,
hardgelatin
hard
gelatin
capsules
be
sealed
(
59
fr
2542
,
01/18/1994
.
the
proposed
amendment
is
part
of
`
the
agencys
continuing
review
of
the
potential
public
health
threat
posed
by
product
tampering
'
and
was
proposed
to
`
address
specific
vulnerabilities
in
the
otc
market
and
to
improve
consumer
protection
'
(
59
fr
2543
.
in
the
preamble
to
the
proposed
rule
,
fda
recognized
that
,
although
the
packaging
used
at
the
time
of
the
latest
poisoning
incidents
met
fda
requirements
in
effect
at
that
time
,
the
packaging
was
not
designed
to
reveal
visible
evidence
of
tampering
.
the
proposed
rule
would
change
`
tamperresistant
tamper
resistant
'
to
`
tamperevident
tamper
evident
'
to
underscore
the
fact
that
current
packaging
technology
is
not
invulnerable
to
tampering
and
would
require
packaging
that
not
only
erects
barriers
to
tampering
,
but
also
alerts
the
consumer
to
signs
of
tampering
.
in
addition
,
in
09/19/1993
,
fda
published
a
regulation
that
requires
the
imprinting
of
solid
oral
dosage
form
drug
products
for
human
use
(
see
58
fr
47948
,
09/13/1993
.
the
regulation
requires
that
every
such
product
be
imprinted
with
a
code
that
allows
identification
of
the
drug
product
and
its
manufacturer
or
distributor
.
the
regulation
will
ensure
,
among
other
things
,
that
consumers
and
health
care
professionals
will
have
this
information
available
in
the
event
of
an
emergency
.
the
imprinting
rule
,
like
the
proposed
rule
for
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
,
responds
to
concerns
that
are
related
to
consumer
use
of
drug
products
rather
than
concerns
focused
on
the
integrity
and
composition
of
such
products
.
the
proposed
rule
,
therefore
,
like
those
pertaining
to
tamperevident
tamper
evident
packaging
and
drug
imprinting
,
is
intended
to
enhance
the
safety
of
drug
products
,
specifically
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drug
products
.
the
recent
statistical
data
available
to
fda
demonstrate
that
the
current
manner
of
holding
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drug
products
until
their
use
by
the
intended
consumer
fails
to
ensure
that
the
drug
products
will
be
safe
because
large
numbers
of
children
are
ingesting
such
products
and
suffering
serious
injuries
or
death
.
existing
technology
permits
additional
safeguards
,
such
as
childresistant
child
resistant
blister
packs
,
to
be
used
for
holding
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drug
products
.
given
the
known
dangers
and
the
ability
to
minimize
or
eliminate
such
dangers
through
the
use
of
existing
technology
,
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
current
good
manufacturing
practice
dictates
that
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
be
used
.
