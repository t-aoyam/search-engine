every
petition
submitted
to
fda
requested
that
the
agency
require
that
ironcontaining
iron
containing
product
labels
contain
warning
statements
about
the
potentially
fatal
effects
of
pediatric
poisonings
from
accidental
ingestion
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
the
cost
associated
with
warning
statements
are
the
cost
of
redesigning
the
label
,
disposing
of
old
labels
,
and
administrative
costs
.
in
01/19/1994
,
fda
published
final
rules
regarding
nutrition
labeling
of
dietary
supplements
in
accordance
with
the
nutrition
labeling
and
education
act
of
1990
(
nlea
)
and
the
dietary
supplement
act
of
1992
.
in
its
analysis
of
those
rules
(
59
fr
352
,
fda
determined
that
the
incremental
cost
of
label
changes
for
dietary
supplement
manufacturers
is
approximately
$
1500
per
label
.
fda
is
proposing
that
the
label
warning
statement
be
printed
directly
on
the
immediate
container
of
the
product
,
ie
,
the
container
that
holds
the
tablet
or
capsule
,
and
on
the
principal
display
panel
of
the
retail
package
,
if
such
package
is
not
the
immediate
container
.
if
a
product
is
sold
in
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
,
the
product
would
be
required
to
bear
the
warning
directly
on
each
unitdose
unit
dose
package
or
on
a
strip
of
unitdose
unit
dose
packages
in
such
a
way
that
separating
the
unitdose
unit
dose
packages
would
not
destroy
the
warning
labeling
.
manufacturers

will
be
required
to
change
their

on
both
the

however

because

ironcontaining
iron

with

also

they

therefore

the

for
