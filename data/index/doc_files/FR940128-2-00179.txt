parcel
c
,
comprised
of
9
83
acres
(
currently
utilized
as
a
communityoriented
community
oriented
outpatient
healthcare
health
care
facility
)
has
several
structures
:
a
main
building
constructed
in
1935
;
three
additions
built
between
1960
and
1972
,
and
two
auxiliary
buildings
built
in
1966
.
the
campus
includes
paved
asphalt
parking
lots
,
concrete
sidewalks
,
and
a
well
maintained
lawn
with
trees
and
vegetation
.
a
6foot
foot
chain
link
fence
,
topped
with
barbed
wire
,
surrounds
the
perimeter
of
parcel
c
.
within
the
buildings
there
are
operating
and
treatment
rooms
,
a
dining
hall
served
by
vending
machines
,
a
library
,
conference

,
an
optical

suite
,
a
gift

,
auxiliary

,
and
administrative

the
purpose
of
the
proposed
action
is
to
convert
the
metropolitan
hospital
into
the
detroit
job
corps
center
for
320
resident
and
50
nonresident
resident
students
.
the
original
patient
hospital
is
adaptable
to
dormitory
accommodations
and
offers
the
necessary
facilities
for
the
job
corps
program
to
provide
basic
education
,
vocational
skills
training
,
work
experience
,
counseling
,
health
care
,
and
related
support
services
.
this
new
center
will
provide
dormitories
,
recreational
,
medical
dental
,
administrative
services
,
educational
and
vocational
training
,
and
storage
space
that
is
consistent
with
job
corps
guidelines
and
center
needs
.
establishing
a
job
corps
center
at
this
location
will
require
some
constructive
change
to
existing
buildings
.
to
meet
recreational
needs
,
based
on
the
job
corps
prototype
for
recreational
activities
,
some
construction
is
needed
;
eg
,
a
recreational
building
,
a
new
ball
field
to
be
constructed
on
parcel
b
,
outdoor
basketball
courts
on
existing
parking
areas
,
and
modification
of
the
existing
fencing
to
extend
completely
around
all
three
parcels
.
the
proposed
project
will
be
constructed
in
accordance
with
local
fire
,
building
,
and
zoning
code
requirements
and
will
not
adversely
impact
the
city
of
detroit
police
,
fire
or
emergency
services
.
the
site
is
located
in
an
urban
setting
and
is
currently
zoned
r6
(
highdensity
high
density
multiplefamily
multiple
family
residential
;
however
,
over
the
years
residential
occupancy
has
declined
substantially
.
prior
to
proceeding
with
the
acquisition
of
the
metropolitan
hospital
,
the
department
of
labor
secured
a
letter
from
the
city
planning
office
and
community
&
amp
;
economic
development
department
that
states
that
the
proposed
job
corps
center
is
an
allowable
use
under
the
existing
zoning
,
thus
,
no
zoning
conflict
will
result
from
the
proposed
change
in
occupancy
and
rehabilitation
of
the
former
metropolitan
hospital
.
the
site
is
bordered
on
the
east
by
an
expressway
.
the
northern
boundary
is
occupied
by
some
multidwelling
dwelling
structures
,
commercial
business
,
and
a
storefront
store
front
type
church
facility
.
the
western
boundary
is
comprised
of
a
soup
kitchen
,
a
bible
missionary
center
,
vacant
lots
,
vacant
store
fronts
,
and
a
large
medical
supply
company
.
the
southern
border
includes
minimal
residential
dwellings
,
a
nursing
home
,
a
fostercare
foster
care
center
for
children
,
and
an
apartment
building
for
teenage
mothers
.
the
portion
of
the
site
identified
as
parcel
b
(
which
is
presently
owned
by
the
state
of
michigan
but
will
be
transferred
to
the
city
of
detroit
in
the
first
quarter
of
1994
)
is
vacant
land
and
is
presently
used
for
illegal
dumping
of
waste
,
vehicle
tires
,
roofing
and
building
materials
,
concrete
,
and
miscellaneous
rubbish
.
it
is
unknown
whether
an
abandoned
underground
storage
tank
,
identified
as
present
on
this
parcel
,
has
been
properly
closed
.
in
addition
,
an
underground
tunnel
is
known
to
exist
at
the
site
but
its
closure
status
is
not
known
.
based
on
the
environmental
assessment
,
it
has
been
determined
that
neither
of
these
site
conditions
will
adversely
impact
the
proposed
activities
.
conversion
of
this
part
of
the
site
to
the
detroit
job
corps
center
through
environmental
restoration
would
be
a
positive
asset
to
the
area
and
would
alleviate
the
state
or
city
of
detroit
of
a
substantial
burden
and
liability
.
