this
final
ruleanalysis

comments
and
changes
note
:
this
appendix
will
not
be
codified
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations
)
the
department
received
comments
on
these
regulations
from
17
commenters
,
13
of
whom
supported
the
regulations
.
comment
:
one
commenter
suggested
that
the
department
used
the
word
`
exception
'
in
the
proposed
regulations
because
the
department
cannot
grant
waivers
.
the
commenter
argued
that
there
is
no
meaningful
distinction
between
`
exception
'
and
`
waiver
'
and
,
therefore
,
the
secretary
lacks
the
authority
to
grant
`
exceptions
'
to
requirements
that
evaluations
of
chapter
1
and
mep
programs
be
based
on
the
current
national
standards
.
discussion
:
it
is
,
of
course
,
true
that
the
secretary
cannot
waive
statutory
or
regulatory
requirements
absent
specific
authority
.
as
a
result
,
the
secretary
is
engaging
in
formal
rulemaking
to
make
exceptions
to
the
generally
applicable
standards
by
adopting
less
prescriptive
standards
that
would
apply
in
the
case
of
states
that
request
authority
to
use
testing
tied
to
state
systemic
reform
efforts
in
lieu
of
separate
chapter
1
evaluations
.
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
the
secretary
would
not
be
granting
exceptions
to
any
statutory
requirements
.
rather
,
he
would
be
granting
exceptions
to
particular
regulatory
provisions
that
were
initially
promulgated
and
have
now
been
revisited
through
the
appropriate
rulemaking
process
.
by
authorizing
the
secretary
to
grant
`
exceptions
'
the
regulations
clarify
that
the
generally
applicable
national
evaluation
standards
are
still
the
primary
provisions
governing
chapter
1
and
mep
evaluations
.
the
secretary
recognizes
,
however
,
that
some
states
,
as
part
of
their
systemic
state
education
reform
efforts
,
have
developed
new
assessment
systems
that
may
be
inconsistent
with
these
standards
because
,
for
example
,
they
are
not
based
on
national
norms
or
do
not
test
children
in
every
grade
.
these
regulations
contain
less
prescriptive
national
standards
that
permit
these
states
to
use
their
own
assessment
systems
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
their
chapter
1
and
mep
programs
,
rather
than
requiring
these
states
to
administer
separate
tests
purely
for
chapter
1
and
mep
purposes
.
changes
:
none
.
comment
:
one
commenter
asserted
that
the
regulations
do
not
comply
with
the
chapter
1
statute
.
according
to
the
commenter
,
the
secretary
is
`
waiving
all
chapter
1
testing
requirements
*
*
*
*
*
*
without
adopting
any
substitute
that
can
equally
ensure
compliance
with
the
statute
'
in
particular
,
the
commenter
contended
that
the
regulations
would
eliminate
the
requirement
to
use
`
objective
measurements
'
of
`
individual
student
achievement
'
thereby
shifting
the
focus
away
from
individual
students
.
the
commenter
also
argued
that
the
proposed
regulations
would
undermine
the
statutory
requirement
that
improved
student
performance
be
sustained
for
more
than
one
year
.
discussion
:
these
regulations
neither
waive
nor
are
inconsistent
with
any
statutory
requirements
.
for
example
,
the
basic
evaluation
requirement
in
section
1019a
)
of
chapter
1
requires
an
lea
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
programs
assisted
under
chapter
1
.
the
lea
must
use
`
objective
measurement
of
individual
student
achievement
in
basic
skills
and
more
advanced
skills
,
aggregated
for
the
lea
as
a
whole
'
as
an
indicator
of
the
impact
of
the
program
.
under
the
type
of
state
assessment
system
to
which
the
exception
would
apply
,
all
of
these
requirements
would
have
to
be
met
.
the
assessments
would
have
touse
objective
measures
;
measure
basic
and
more
advanced
skills
;
assess
the
achievement
of
individual
children
;
and
be
capable
of
being
aggregated
for
each
lea
as
a
whole
.
nothing
in
section
1019a
,
however
,
requires
these
assessment
systems
to
assess
each
child
served
in
chapter
1
or
to
be
based
on
national
norms
;
rather
,
the
secretary
imposed
these
requirements
through
the
current
national
standards
.
moreover
,
contrary
to
the
commenters
interpretation
,
the
requirement
in
section
1019a3
)
regarding
`
sustained
gains
'
relates
to
improved
performance
of
the
program
over
a
period
of
more
than
one
year
,
not
to
individual
student
performance
.
as
the
preamble
indicates
,
under
these
final
regulations
seas
and
leas
must
continue
to
meet
all
statutory
assessment
requirements
.
in
particular
,
seas
and
leas
must
still
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
their
chapter
1
programs
under
section
1019
,
perform
the
annual
review
required
under
section
1021a
,
measure
sustained
program
gains
under
sections
1019a3
)
and
1021a2
,
identify
schools
and
students
in
need
of
program
improvement
under
section
1021
(
b
)
and
(
f
,
and
meet
schoolwide
project
accountability
requirements
under
section
1015e
.
similarly
,
under
the
mep
,
seas
must
ensure
that
they
and
their
operating
agencies
adhere
to
the
requirements
of
sections
1012b
,
1019b
,
and
1202a6
)
to
use
desired
outcomes
for
evaluating
performance
,
to
collect
and
report
demographic
and
performance
data
,
and
to
examine
sustained
gains
for
formerly
migratory
children
.
if
the
secretary
grants
an
exception
under
these
final
regulations
,
these
requirements
may
be
met
using
the
state
assessment
and
any
other
sources
of
information
deemed
appropriate
.
thus
,
if
a
state
assessment
system
does
not
provide
sufficient
information
to
meet
one
or
more
of
these
requirements
,
the
sea
,
lea
,
or
operating
agency
would
have
to
supplement
that
system
with
other
appropriate
information
.
changes
:
none
.
comment
:
one
commenter
asserted
that
the
proposed
regulations
did
not
satisfy
the
administrative
procedure
act
.
the
commenter
specifically
argued
that
the
proposed
regulations
should
contain
the
criteria
on
which
exceptions
would
be
based
so
that
commenters
could
adequately
respond
.
discussion
:
in
accordance
with
the
administrative
procedure
act
,
the
proposed
regulations
contained
adequate
notice
of
the
standards
that
states
would
have
to
meet
to
be
excepted
from
the
generally
applicable
national
evaluation
standards
.
those
standards
werethe
assessment
system
has
been
developed
to
support
a
states
education
reform
efforts
;
the
system
provides
information
about
the
yearly
performance
of
each
chapter
1
school
;
and
the
information
provided
is
from
at
least
one
grade
level
,
measures
student
achievement
in
basic
and
more
advanced
skills
and
challenging
subject
matter
,
and
can
be
aggregated
for
the
lea
as
a
whole
.
however
,
in
response
to
several
comments
,
the
secretary
has
added
two
additional
standards
and
one
clarification
.
the
assessment
system
must
yield
consistent
results
that
accurately
reflect
what
the
assessment
system
was
designed
to
measure
.
the
use
of
the
assessment
system
may
not
impair
an
seas
or
leas
ability
to
account
for
results
under
chapter
1
.
the
information
from
the
assessment
system
must
be
from
at
least
one
grade
level
in
each
chapter
1
school
.
similar
standards
apply
to
the
mep
,
except
that
the
system
must
provide
a
statewide
estimate
of
the
yearly
performance
of
migratory
children
in
the
state
,
rather
than
information
on
individual
schools
.
changes
:
two
additional
standards
have
been
added
to
§
200
90
)
and
201
57
.
the
state
assessment
system
must
yield
consistent
results
that
accurately
reflect
what
the
assessment
system
was
designed
to
measure
,
and
use
of
the
system
may
not
impair
an
seas
or
leas
ability
to
account
for
results
under
chapter
1
or
the
mep
.
in
addition
,
§
200
90
)
has
been
revised
to
make
clear
that
the
assessment
system
must
provide
information
from
at
least
one
grade
level
in
each
chapter
1
school
.
comment
:
one
commenter
contended
that
the
secretarys
explanation
for
why
these
regulations
are
needed
was
inadequate
.
in
the
commenters
view
,
the
secretary
offered
only
`
an
assortment
of
unsubstantiated
policyoriented
policy
oriented
statements
in
lieu
of
hard
,
objective
facts
'
the
commenter
concluded
that
the
secretary
is
trying
to
change
the
national
evaluation
standards
by
`
administrative
fiat
'
without
any
explanation
of
the
reasons
and
supporting
evidence
for
the
changes
.
