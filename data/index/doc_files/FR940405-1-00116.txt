the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
gives
the
secretary
the
right
to
promulgate
standards
to
assure
employees
safe
and
healthful
working
conditions
.
employers
must
comply
with
the
standards
which
the
secretary
promulgates
.
the
act
defines
an
employer
expansively
as
a
person
with
employees
in
a
business
affecting
interstate
commerce
.
the
agency
believes
that
the
proposal
as
written
will
protect
employees
from
the
risks
of
poor
indoor
air
quality
.
where
the
owner
of
a
business
is
not
the
owner
of
the
space
where
such
business
operates
,
the
owner
or
landlord
of
the
building
will
probably
also
be
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
the
definition
contained
in
this
proposal
.
this
is
so
because
the
building
owner
or
operator
will
generally
have
employees
(
either
on
site
or
off
site
)
and
will
be
engaged
in
a
business
affecting
interstate
commerce
.
in
such
cases
the
situation
will
be
construed
to
be
a
multiemployer
employer
worksite
.
such
situations
are
quite
common
in
the
context
of
construction
sites
.
the
agency
does
not
believe
that
there
is
any
reason
to
treat
nonindustrial
multiemployer
employer
worksites
differently
from
construction
multiemployer
employer
worksites
for
purposes
of
compliance
.
osha
has
a
long
history
of
enforcing
osha
standards
in
multiemployer
employer
worksites
.
nothing
in
this
proposed
rule
would
change
the
position
that
the
agency
has
taken
in
cases
such
as

as
a
general
matter
each
employer
is
responsible
for
the
health
and
safety
of
his
her
own
employees
.
however
,
under
certain
circumstances
an
employer
may
be
cited
for
endangering
the
safety
or
health
of
another
employers
employees
.
in
determining
who
to
hold
responsible
,
osha
will
look
at
who
created
the
hazard
,
who
controlled
the
hazard
,
and
whether
all
reasonable
means
were
taken
to
deal
with
the
hazard
.
it
is
contemplated
that
in
those
cases
where
there
is
a
multiemployer
employer
worksite
that
the
affected
employers
will
divide
up
the
responsibilities
in
the
manner
in
which
they
make
the
most
sense
.
those
who
have
information
at
their
disposal
that
is
required
to
be
kept
under
the
proposal
will
make
use
of
the
information
or
make
it
available
to
whoever
will
need
that
information
in
the
discharge
of
their
duties
.
for
example
,
the
building
engineer
may
have
possession
of
the
schematics
of
the
ventilation
system
.
the
engineer
would
make
them
available
to
the
person
responsible
for
maintaining
the
system
as
well
as
the
person
responsible
for
developing
the
iaq
compliance
plan
(
if
that
is
not
the
same
person
.
the
proposal
is
designed
to
promote
the
efficient
resolution
of
indoor
air
quality
problems
and
will
not
result
in
duplicative
efforts
.
there
is
nothing
in
the
proposal
,
for
example
,
that
would
prevent
the
building
owner
(
who
is
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
)
from
gathering
the
required
information
from
the
various
lessee
employers
in
the
premises
,
developing
,
and
implementing
an
iaq
compliance
plan
which
would
be
shared
with
the
various
employers
occupying
the
premises
.
in
addition
,
it
may
be
more
efficient
for
the
building
owner
to
develop
and
maintain
the
records
required
by
the
proposal
,
again
sharing
them
with
the
various
employertenants
employer
tenants
.
the
agency
believes
that
the
cooperative
operative
interrelationships
which
the
performance
oriented
proposal
permits
will
avoid
duplication
of
compliance
activities
even
within
multiemployer
employer
worksites
.
the
term
`
hvac
system
'
means
the
collective
components
of
the
heating
,
ventilation
and
airconditioning
air
conditioning
system
including

dampers
and
actuators
,
humidifiers
,
air

ductwork
,
automatic

,
and

.
this
definition
also
intends
to
focus
on
those
hvac
system
components
whose
failure
,
degradation
,
or
misuse
would
adversely
impact
indoor
air
quality
.
the
term
`
nonindustrial
work
environment
'
means
an
indoor
or
enclosed
work
space
such
as
,
but
not
limited
to
,
offices
,
educational
facilities
,
commercial
establishments
,
and

facilities
,
and
office
areas
,
cafeterias
,
and

located
in

nonindustrial
work
environments
do
not
include
manufacturing

production
facilities
,
residences
,

,
and
agricultural
operations
.
the
term
`
renovation

'
means
building
modification
involving
activities
that
include
but
are
not
limited
to
:
removal
or
replacement
of
walls
,

,

.
the
terms
`
hvac
system
,
`
nonindustrial
work
environment
,
and
`
renovation
and
remodeling
'
are
defined
to
clarify
and
illustrate
the
parameters
under
which
obligations
of
the
standard
are
incurred
.
for
example
,
the
definition
of
`
hvac
system
'
lists
what
osha
believes
to
be
typical
components
of
such
systems
which
directly
affect
indoor
air
quality
.
these
components
are
enumerated
since
provisions
under
the
standard
propose
to
require
employers
to
perform
routine
inspection
and
maintenance
on
those
components
.
`
renovation
and
remodeling
'
is
defined
to
inform
the
employer
of
the
situations
under
which
the
standard
proposes
to
require
the
employer
to
take
special
precautions
when
those
activities
take
place
.

paragraph
(

)
this
paragraph
proposes
to
require

to
obtain
or
develop
certain
written
information
that
will
facilitate
implementation
of
measures
necessary
to
prevent
degradation
of
indoor
air
quality
.
paragraph
(
c2
)
proposes
to
require
the
employer
to
identify
a
designated
person
to
be
given
the
responsibility
of
overseeing
establishment
and
implementation
of
the
written
compliance
program
.
paragraph
(
c3
)
proposes
to
require
the
employer
to
establish
a
written
iaq
compliance
program
to
include
at
least
the
following
information
:
a
description
of
the
facility
building
systems
;
schematics
or
construction
documents
locating
building

equipment
;
information
on
the
daily
operation
and
management
of
the
building

;
a
description
of
the

and
its
function
;
a
written
maintenance
program
;
and
a
checklist
for
visual
inspection
of
the
building
systems
.
further
,
paragraph
(

)
proposes
to
require
that
the
following
information
also
must
be
retained
,
if
available
,
to
assist
in

evaluations
:
as

require
the
establishment
of

as
part
of
the

osha
believes
that
written
plans
are
an
essential
element
of
an
overall
compliance
program
since
it
will
encourage
employers
to
focus
on
indoor
air

and
implement
the
necessary
controls

measures
to
achieve
compliance
with

a

osha
standards
