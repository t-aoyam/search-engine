stated
that
the
`
current
test
for
erythema
'
is
inadequate
to
test
for
the
full
spectrum
of
uva
radiation
because
erythema
is
not
a
valid
measurement
of
uva
exposure
.
the
comment
argued
that
using
the
erythema
action
spectrum
to
test
for
uva
protection
will
give
consumers
a
false
sense
of
the
extent
of
uva
protection
afforded
by
a
product
.
the
comment
added
that
the
immediate
pigment
darkening
(
ipd
)
action
spectrum
is
preferable
because
it
is
broad
enough
to
take
into
account
almost
all
uva
wavelengths
.
another
comment
stated
that
the
ipd
action
spectrum
is
indicative
of
a
true
broad
spectrum
uva
response
.
one
comment
noted
that
the
ipd
action
spectrum
was
first
described
to
extend
from
300
to
420
nm
,
with
a
broad
peak
between
340
and
370
nm
(
ref
.

.
the
action
spectrum
was
later
described
to
extend
from
300
to
620
nm
,
with
a
peak
effectiveness
between
400
and
500
nm
(
visible
light
)
(
ref
.

.
because
of
the
difference
between
these
two
reported
spectra
,
the
comment
reevaluated
the
action
spectrum
for
ipd
between
310
and
400
nm
and
reported
that
the
ipd
action
spectrum
extends
from
320
to
400
nm
with
a
low
peak
around
340
nm

concurrent
with
determining
which
testing
procedure
is
appropriate
for
use
in
validating
the
uva
protection
provided
by
a
sunscreen
drug
product
,
the
agency
must
determine
what
portion
of
the
uva
spectrum
should
be
blocked
by
the
product
before
consumers
are
effectively
protected
against
the
hazards
of
uva
radiation
.
the
agency
would
like
to
consider
the
following
specific
questions
at
the
meeting
:
1
.
which
action
spectra
are
the
most
important
with
respect
to
skin
damage
caused
by
uva
radiation
?
2
.
is
the
erythema
action
spectrum
an
adequate
surrogate
for
uva
biological
risk
,
or
is
some
other
action
spectrum
(
such
as
the
ipd
action
spectrum
)
more
appropriate
?
3
.
can
a
sunscreen
drug
product
that
protects
consumers
against
the
shorter
uva
wavelengths
(
320
to
340
nm
)
but
not
against
longer
uva
wavelengths
(
340
to
400
nm
)
prevent
significant
uva
damage
?
4
.
what
should
consumers
expect
from
a
sunscreen
drug
product
that
is
labeled
to
provide
protection
against
uva
radiation
or
as
a
`
broad
spectrum
'
sunscreen
?
ii
.
uva
testing
procedures
the
agency
did
not
propose
a
method
for
determining
uva
protection
in
the
tentative
final
monograph
for
otc
sunscreen
drug
products
.
the
agency
stated
that
a
method
should
be
developed
and
validated
in
the
same
manner
as
the
sunscreen
testing
procedure
for
protection
against
uvb
radiation
(
58
fr
28194
at
28250
.
the
agency
noted
that
any
such
method
should
clearly
demonstrate
that
a
particular
product
provides
significant
protection
against
uva
radiation
.
the
method
should
include
the
use
of
a
control
sunscreen
preparation
that
absorbs
uva
radiation
and
that
can
be
used
to
assure
the
reliability
of
the
testing
procedure
and
equipment
.
the
method
should
demonstrate
that
a
sunscreen
ingredient
either
does
or
does
not
protect
against
uva
radiation
.
the
agency
requested
comments
and
data
regarding
an
appropriate
testing
method
for
otc
sunscreen
drug
products
that
protect
against
uva
radiation
.
in
response
,
the
agency
received
information
and
data
pertaining
to
several
uva
testing
procedures
,
including
both
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
test
methods
.
one
comment
recommended
adoption
of
an
in
vitro
test
method
that
does
not
rely
upon
either
photosensitization
or
nonsolar
light
sources
for
determining
uva
protection
for
normal
skin
(
ref
.

.
according
to
the
comment
,
this
method
involves
:
(
1
)
determining
the
uv
absorbance
spectrum
of
the
sunscreen
product
,
(
2
)
calculating
a
convolution
spectrum
by
multiplying
the
solar
spectrum
with
the
current
cie
hazard
spectrum
,
