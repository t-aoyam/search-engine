in
response
to
the
questions
which
were
raised
,
nasphv
made
the
following
replies
.
the
local
needs
of
rural
areas
within
the
united
states
have
changed
since
1979
,
and
the
lack
of
adequate
veterinary
services
in
rural
states
is
no
longer
a
problem
.
the
veterinary
profession
stands
ready
to
accommodate
owners
of
multiple
pets
.
nasphv
also
indicated
that
in
many
cases
,
the
cost
of
a
rabies
vaccination
from
a
veterinarian
had
not
kept
up
with
the
rising
consumer
price
index
.
in
addition
,
the
association
stated
that
the
inconvenience
of
traveling
to
and
from
a
veterinary
clinic
during
business
hours
for
rabies
vaccinations
was
no
different
than
the
inconvenience
of
pet
ownership
in
general
,
and
that
improper
vaccination
by
nonveterinarians
was
worse
than
no
vaccination
at
all
because
such
vaccination
gave
a
false
sense
of
security
.
the
nasphv
argued
that
proper
handling
of
animal
rabies
vaccines
,
including
cold
storage
,
physical
examination
of
the
animal
receiving
vaccine
to
ensure
the
health
status
of
the
animal
,
proper
timing
and
route
of
administration
according
to
label
instructions
,
and
knowledge
of
rabies
control
were
essential
for
effective
rabies
vaccination
.
the
nasphv
further
argued
that
in
a
mobile
society
such
as
the
united
states
,
it
was
unfair
and
unsafe
for
the
public
to
rely
on
so
many
different
state
rabies
laws
and
regulations
to
protect
the
public
.
the
restriction
of
rabies
vaccines
at
the
federal
level
would
reduce
confusion
,
unnecessary
revaccination
,
and
the
necessity
for
human
postexposure
exposure
treatment
.
further
,
as
endemic
reservoirs
of
wildlife
rabies
continue
to
spread
and
put
more
areas
of
the
united
states
at
risk
,
the
standardization
of
rabies
control
becomes
more
important
.
the
association
concluded
that
the
need
for
proper
administration
and
improved
documentation
of
animal
rabies
vaccinations
are
the
most
important
issues
concerning
national
rabies
prevention
in
man
and
animals
.
a
case
arose
in
1986
,
in
which
a
rabies
vaccine
manufacturer
needed
to
follow
documentation
of
rabies
vaccinations
in
order
to
trace
recipients
of
its
vaccine
after
a
change
had
been
made
in
the
instructions
for
administration
.
since
the
particular
manufacturers
vaccine
was
sold
to
and
administered
by
veterinarians
or
state
authorized
recipients
,
in
large
part
,
the
appropriate
records
were
available
for
the
tracking
and
revaccination
of
thousands
of
animals
.
public
health
officials
have
expressed
concern
regarding
the
uncertainties
of
vaccine
administration
and
certification
when
animals
are
vaccinated
by
nonveterinarians
or
without
adequate
veterinary
supervision
.
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
some
distributors
,
in
states
without
restrictions
on
vaccine
sale
or
administration
,
are
distributing
rabies
vaccines
to
unauthorized
individuals
in
other
states
that
currently
have
such
restrictions
.
this
practice
destroys
the
effectiveness
of
state
programs
designed
to
monitor
and
verify
vaccine
sale
and
administration
in
such
states
and
is
contrary
to
their
law
.
such
practice
also
creates
significant
safety
concerns
since
any
failure
associated
with
vaccine
administration
and
documentation
increases
the
risk
of
rabies
exposure
to
both
animals
and
man
.
dogs
and
cats
that
have
properly
documented
rabies
vaccinations
and
that
are
involved
in
bite
cases
involving
a
human
being
are
isolated
and
observed
for
10
days
at
a
veterinary
quarantine
facility
to
confirm
the
absence
of
rabies
.
when
the
vaccination
record
of
a
dog
or
cat
that
has
bitten
someone
cannot
be
verified
,
the
animal
may
be
euthanized
to
determine
if
rabies
virus
is
present
in
brain
tissue
.
in
these
cases
,
the
individual
who
has
been
bitten
and
the
physician
are
placed
in
the
position
of
weighing
the
risks
and
costs
of
postexposure
exposure
prophylactic
treatment
against
the
odds
of
having
been
exposed
to
rabies
.
because
the
verification
of
animal
rabies
vaccination
is
important
in
decisions
relating
to
both
animals
and
man
,
the
association
argued
that
the
issue
of
proper
documentation
of
vaccination
is
a
major
concern
.
the
fact
that
618
cases
of
rabies
among
domestic
animals
in
the
united
states
(
including
155
dogs
and
189
cats
)
were
reported
to
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
in
1991
makes
an
informed
choice
important
.
because
of
questions
concerning
proper
vaccine
handling
,
storage
,
administration
,
documentation
of
vaccination
and
revaccination
,
and
recordkeeping
,
many
state
public
health
departments
disregard
rabies
vaccination
claims
by
owners
and
only
rely
on
documentation
from
a
veterinarian
as
proof
of
vaccination
.
after
reviewing
nasphvs
request
to
amend
the
federal
restriction
on
the
distribution
and
use
of
animal
rabies
vaccines
,
aphis
has
determined
that
it
needs
additional
information
to
determine
the
appropriate
course
of
action
with
respect
to
this
matter
.
before
proceeding
with
a
proposal
to
amend
the
federal
restriction
on
animal
rabies
vaccines
,
the
agency
must
determine
whether
such
an
amendment
would
in
fact
be
beneficial
,
whether
rabies
control
programs
and
rabies
vaccination
could
not
be
better
managed
by
the
states
and
local
jurisdictions
,
and
whether
the
benefit
of
federal
control
would
outweigh
the
cost
of
such
a
program
.
