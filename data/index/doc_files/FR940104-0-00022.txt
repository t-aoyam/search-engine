provides
to

any
information
related

standard

requirement
that
operating

are
to
function
independently
to
the
maximum

practicable
will
help
ensure
that
the
opportunity
to
share
such

is
minimized
.
if
,
for
example
,
a
pipeline
and
its
marketing
affiliate
could
evade
the
contemporaneous
disclosure
requirement
simply
by
using
the
same
person
to
arrange
transportation
on
the
pipeline
and
market
gas
for
the
affiliate
,
the
rule
would
be
substantially
undermined
.
throughout
the
rulemaking
proceeding
,
however
,
the
commission
has
held
that
complete
divestment
,
divorcement
,
or
organizational
separation
of
pipelines
and
their
marketing
affiliates
is
not
necessary
to
prevent
the
abuses
at
which
the
marketing
affiliates
rule
is
aimed
.
the
independent
functioning
requirement
does
not
require
a
pipeline
to
separate
all
of
its
employees
from
those
of
a
marketing
affiliate
,
but
rather
only
operating
employees
.
this
determination
is
consistent
with
the
commissions
finding
that
complete
organizational
separation
is
unnecessary
and
may
even
be
harmful
where
