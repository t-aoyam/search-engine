uses

occupational
exposure
asbestos
is
ubiquitous
in
the
environment

more
than
40
%
of
the
land
area
of
the
united
states
is
composed
of
minerals
which
may
contain
asbestos
.
fortunately
,
the
actual
formation
of
great
amounts
of
asbestos
is
relatively
rare
.
nonetheless
,
there
are
locations
in
which
environmental
exposure
can
be
severe
such
as
in
the
serpentine
hills
of
california
.
there
are
thousands
of
uses
for
asbestos
in
industry
and
the
home
.
asbestos
abatement
workers
are
the
most
current
segment
of
the
population
to
have
occupational
exposure
to
great
amounts
of
asbestos
.
if
the

is
undisturbed
,
there
is
no

approximately
95

asbestos
in
place
in
the
united
states
is
chrysotile
.
amosite
and
crocidolite
make
up
nearly
all
the
difference
.
tremolite
and
anthophyllite
make
up
a
very
small
percentage
.
tremolite
is
found
in
extremely
small
amounts
in
certain
chrysotile
deposits
.
actinolite

probably
greatest

seal

vial
is
more
than
adequate
.
be
sure
to
collect
samples
from
all
layers
and
phases
of
material
.
if
possible
,
make
separate
samples
of

in
determining
the
actual
hazard
.
do
not

kind
to
collect

.
the
