supplementary
information
:
program
background
and
objectives
the
pediatric
aids
demonstration
program
was
initiated
in
1988
.
the
program
grew
from
13
projects
funded
at
$
44
million
to
a
total
of
44
projects
funded
at
$
208
in
1993
.
since
1988
,
the
program
has
evolved
from
a
primary
focus
on
the
coordination
of
services
for
the
management
and
care
of
infected
children
and
their
families
to
also
address
the
broader
prevention
and
care
needs
of
youth
and
women
affected
by
the
hiv
infection
,
aids
or
related
conditions
.
in
fy
1994
,
congress
funded
the
pediatric
aids
demonstration
program
under
title
iv
of
the
ryan
white
comprehensive
aids
resources
emergency
(
care
)
act
(
title
iv
.
the
program
will
be
permanently
authorized
in
section
2671
of
the
public
health
service
act
.
title
iv
authorizes
demonstration
grants
to
organizations
to
provide
comprehensive
services
and
enhance
access
to
clinical
research
trials
for
children
,
youth
,
women
,
and
families
with
or
affected
by
hiv
infection
.
as
a
result
of
this
transfer
to
title
iv
,
the
focus
of
the
program
is
further
expanded
to
develop
innovative
models
that
link
systems
of
comprehensive
primary/communitybased
primary/community
based
medical
and
social
services
for
the
affected
population
with
nih
and
other
clinical
research
trials
.
purpose
the
purpose
of
the
funding
is
to
improve
and
expand
the
system
of
comprehensive
care
services
for
children
,
youth
,
women
,
and
families
who
are
infected
with
or
affected
by
hiv
and
aids
and
to
link
comprehensive
care
systems
with
clinical
research
.
funds
authorized
and
appropriated
under
title
iv
will
be
used
to
demonstrate
and
test
potentially
replicable
models
of
service
delivery
and
clinical
research
to
respond
to
the
unique
and
challenging
problems
of
access
to
a
comprehensive
care
system
faced
by
hiv
and
aids
affected
children
,
youth
,
women
,
and
families
.
while
children
,
youth
,
and
women
represent
the
most
rapidly
growing
population
groups
affected
by
hiv
and
aids
,
they
also
represent
the
groups
facing
the
greatest
barriers
in
accessing
care
and
research
.
these
groups
disproportionately
are
minorities
and
living
in
poverty
.
children
,
youth
,
and
women
have
a
complex
array
of
economic
and
social
problems
that
increase
their
need
for
comprehensive
services
and
increase
the
cost
and
intensity
of
care
.
furthermore
,
since
they
comprise
the
most
recent
and
fastest
growing
population
groups
impacted
by
hiv
and
aids
,
the
care
infrastructure
and
provider
capacity
are
often
not
developed
and
require
targeted
resources
and
efforts
to
develop
an
appropriate
system
of
care
.
given
these
unmet
needs
,
activities
under
the
demonstration
grants
should
address
the
following
goals
:
_
foster
the
development
of
comprehensive
care
infrastructures
,
including
primary
care
,
that
increase
access
to
culturallycompetent
culturally
competent
,
familycentered
family
centered
,
communitybased
community
based
,
coordinated
care
.
_
emphasize
prevention
within
the
comprehensive
care
system
in
order
to
reduce
the
spread
of
the
hiv
infection
to
vulnerable
populations
.
