projects
will
be
subject
to
independent
scientific
review
before
trustee
council
approval
.
8
.
meaningful

solicited
.
9
.
government
agencies
will
be
funded
only
for
restoration
work
that
they
do
not
normally
conduct
.
four
types
of
restoration
actions
are
identified
and
discussed
in
the
draft
restoration
plan
:
general
restoration
,
habitat
protection
and
acquisition
,
monitoring
and
research
,
and
public
information
and
administration
.
alternatives
to
the
proposed
action
place
different
emphases
on
each
of
these
categories
of
restoration
actions
.
general
restoration
consists
of
activities
that
fall
within
manipulation
of
the
environment
,
management
of
human
use
for
reduction
of
marine
pollution
.
decisions
about
conducting
general
restoration
projects
would
look
at
the
following
factors
:
extent
of
natural
recovery
,
the
value
of
an
injured
resource
to
the
ecosystem
and
to
the
public
,
the
duration
of
benefits
,
the
technical
feasibility
of
the
project
,
the
likelihood
of
success
,
the
relationship
of
costs
to
expected
benefits
,
potential
for
harmful
side
effects
,
benefits
to
more
than
one
resource
,
effects
on
health
and
human
safety
,
consistency
with
applicable
laws
,
and
policies
,
and
duplication
with
other
actions
.
habitat
protection
and
acquisition
is
a
category
that
includes
purchase
of
private
land
or
interests
in
land
such
as
conservation
easements
,
mineral
rights
,
or
timber
rights
.
it
also
includes
recommendations
for
changing
public
agency
management
practices
.
specific
policies
that
relate
to
habitat
protection
and
acquisition
are
proposed
.
these
policies
deal
with
ranking
potential
lands
to
determine
potential
benefits
,
the
need
for
a
willing
seller
,
purchasing
at
fair
market
value
,
post
acquisition
management
of
the
acquired
lands
and
involving
the
public
in
the
prioritization
process
.
monitoring
and
research
consists
of
recovery
monitoring
,
restoration
monitoring
and
ecological
monitoring
and
research
.
specific
policies
governing
the
selecting
and
performance
of
monitoring
activities
are
discussed
in
the
draft
restoration
plan
.
public
information
and
administration
is
the
last
category
of
restoration
actions
.
it
consists
of
all
necessary
administrative
actions
that
are
not
attributable
to
a
particular
project
.
the
draft
restoration
plan
goal
for
this
category
is
for
administrative
costs
to
average
no
more
than
5
%
of
overall
restoration
expenditures
for
the
remainder
of
the
settlement
period
.
general
restoration
objectives
have
been
developed
for
resources
that
are
recovering
,
resources
not
recovering
,
resources
where
the
recovery
is
unknown
,
resources
such
as
archaeological
resources
and
wilderness
,
and
services
.
these
broad
objectives
will
guide
in
the
development
of
annual
work
plans
.
