several
alternatives
were
evaluated
.
a
no
action
alternative
was
evaluated
for
both
subprojects
.
two
alternative
routes
for
the
new
sewer
main
in
the
east
area
were
examined
.
an
alternative
route
for
the
sewer
main
to
the
outlying
areas
was
not
evaluated
since
the
only
practical
route
follows
the
existing
creek
crossings
.
the
proposed
upgrades
occurring
in
the
floodplain
would
not
have
any
longterm
long
term
effects
upon
the
floodplain
or
surrounding
environment
.
only
during
construction
could
the
project
potentially
affect
the
floodplain
or
the
aquatic
life
in
white
oak
creek
and
the
impacts
,
if
any
,
would
be
negligible
.
during
construction
,
sediment
could
be
introduced
into
the
creek
and
unnamed
tributary
.
doe
will
prepare
a
sediment
control
plan
identifying
the
best
management
practices
to
be
employed
during
construction
to
minimize
potential
harm
to
or
within
the
affected
floodplain
.
control
measures
would
include
the
use
of
sediment
and
erosion
control
fences
to
minimize
siltation
.
procedural
measures
would
include
excavating
trenches
of
the
minimum
size
and
performing
construction
activities
during
dry
periods
.
immediately
upon
installation
of
sections
of
the
sewer
line
,
the
trench
would
be
backfilled
and
compacted
.
the
area
would
then
be
graded
to
the
original
contour
and
seeded
.
the
upgrade
project
would
conform
to
all
applicable
state
and
local
floodplain
protection
standards
.
doe
will
endeavor
to
allow
15
days
of
public
review
after
publication
of
the
statement
of
findings
prior
to
implementing
the
proposed
action
.
