largely
are
based
on

developed
by

and
as

are

the

standard

to
respond
to
the

and
improve

.
other
sources
of

and

are
in

and
countermeasures
to
respond

in

there

that

the

the

has
,
over
the
years
,
adopted
security
procedures
to
respond
to
the
growing
threat
to
civil

.
the
trend
has
been
towards
a
more
sophisticated
and
dangerous
threat
.
until

,
hijackings
of

air

primarily
were
conducted
by
single
individuals
who
were
asylum
seekers
,
expatriates
desiring
to
return
to

,
mentally
disturbed
persons
,
or
single
individuals
who
were
carrying
out
their
criminal
acts
for
personal
motives
.
beginning
in
1985
,
however
,
there
were
a
series
of
sophisticated
hijackings
and
attempted
hijackings

registry
.
these
hijackings
were
conducted
by
relatively
wellorganized
well
organized
teams
of
trained
individuals
with
political
motives
primarily
connected
to
international
affairs
in
the
middle
east
.
the
06/19/1985
hijacking
of
twa
847
and
intelligence
reporting
in
subsequent
years
clearly
indicated
that
us
.
air
carriers
were
facing
a
higher
level
and
type
of
threat
.
similar
incidents
that
occurred
over
the
next
few
years
routinely
involved
murder
and
extended
hostage
takings
.
the
change
in
the
hijacking
threat
faced
by
us
.
air
carriers
was
accompanied
by
increasingly
sophisticated
and
deadly
sabotage
attacks
against
civil
aviation
.
these
attacks
also
were
perpetrated
by
wellorganized
well
organized
international
terrorist
groups
with
,
in
some
cases
,
nation
states
also
involved
as
supporters
and
facilitators
,
if
not
direct
participants
.
these
groups
and
countries
repeatedly
attempted
to
collect
information
concerning
extant
security
countermeasures
and
to
devise
methods
of
attack
to
bypass
or
defeat
those
countermeasures
.
with

1985

attacks

the

,
along
with

civil

community
,
recognized
that
an
entirely
new
phase
of
terrorism
had
opened
.
in
response
,
the

issued
new
,
detailed
,
amendments
to
the
air

program
to
counter
the
threat
to

carriers
at
foreign
airports
.
the
faa
also
developed
new
procedures
to
decrease
the
vulnerability
of
airports
to
terrorist
attacks
.
these
procedures
,
both
foreign
and
domestic
,
went
into
both
the
air
carrier
and
airport
security
programs
.
because
of
the
increasing
sophistication
of
those
who
may
pose
a
threat
to
civil
aviation
,
it
is
increasingly
important
that
information
regarding
the
manner
in
which
the
faa
,
the
airport
operators
,
and
the
air
carriers
may
seek
to
guard
against
criminal
threats
be
protected
.
the
unauthorized
disclosure
of
sensitive
aviation
security
information
could
assist
in
the
development
of
techniques
to
counter
those
measures
.
the
faa
is
mindful
of
the
publics
legitimate
interest
in
how
the
faa
operates
and
how
it
regulates
the
aviation
industry
.
the
faa
has
a
corresponding
responsibility
to
prevent
undue
disclosure
of
information
that
could
compromise
public
safety
if
it
falls
into
the
wrong
hands
.
the
proposals
in
this
notice
have
been
carefully
considered
to
cover
only
information
that
could
reasonably
be
anticipated
to
be
damaging
to
the
security
of
the
traveling
public
if
given
to
unauthorized
persons
.
security
programs
are
absolutely
essential
mechanisms
through
which
the
faa
regulates
the
air
carriers
'
and
airports
'
detailed
obligations
with
respect
to
ensuring
civil
aviation
security
.
much
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
programs
depends
on
strictly
limiting
access
to
such
information
to
those
persons
who
have
a
need
to
know
.
unauthorized
disclosure
of
the
specific
provisions
of
the
air
carrier
and
airport
security
programs
or
other
aviation
security
information
would
allow
potential
attackers
of
civil
aviation
to
devise
methods
to
circumvent
or
otherwise
defeat
the
security
provisions
.
it
would
also
discount
the
deterrent
effect
inherently
provided
in
prohibiting
disclosure
of
security
measures
that
may
or
may
not
be
in
place
.
