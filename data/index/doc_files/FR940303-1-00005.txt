summary
:
the
department
of
justice
(
department
)
is
issuing
for
an
additional
30day
day
comment
period
a
proposed
rule
governing
the
circumstances
under
which
its
attorneys
may
communicate
with
persons
and
organizations
known
to
be
represented
by
counsel
in
the
course
of
law
enforcement
investigations
and
proceedings
.
the
purpose
of
the
proposed
rule
is
to
impose
a
comprehensive
,
clear
and
uniform
set
of
regulations
on
the
conduct
of
government
attorneys
during
criminal
and
civil
investigations
and
enforcement
proceedings
.
the
rule
is
intended
to
ensure
that
government
attorneys
adhere
to
the
highest
ethical
standards
,
while
eliminating
the
uncertainty
and
confusion
arising
from
the
variety
of
interpretations
of
state
rules
,
some
of
which
have
been
incorporated
by
reference
as
local
court
rules
in
a
number
of
federal
district
courts
.
the
proposed
rule
establishes
a
general
prohibition
,
subject
to
limited
enumerated
exceptions
,
against
contacts
with
`
represented
parties
'
this
prohibition
derives
from
the
american
bar
association
(
aba
)
code
of
professional
responsibility
and
its
successor
,
the
aba
model
rules
of
professional
conduct
.
the
proposed
rule
generally
permits
investigative
contacts
with
represented
individuals
or
organizations
who
have
not
yet
been
named
as
defendants
in
a
civil
or
criminal
enforcement
proceeding
or
arrested
as
part
of
a
criminal
proceeding
.
however
,
the
rule
would
not
permit
contacts
with
represented
persons
without
the
consent
of
counsel
for
the
purpose
of
negotiating
plea
agreements
,
settlements
or
other
similar
legal
arrangements
.
in
addition
,
the
department
intends
to
issue
substantial
additions
to
the
united
states
attorneys
'
manual
(
manual
)
to
provide
additional
direction
to
department
attorneys
when
they
deal
with
represented
individuals
and
organizations
,
in
order
to
accommodate
more
fully
the
principles
and
purposes
underlying
the
bar
rules
.
those
provisions
further
restrict
government
attorneys
when
they
contact
targets
of
criminal
or
civil
law
enforcement
investigations
who
are
known
to
be
represented
by
counsel
,
and
when
they
communicate
with
other
represented
persons
.
the
intended
additions
to
the
united
states
attorneys
'
manual
are
provided
for
reference
as
part
of
this
commentary

general
discussion
the
department
issued
for
notice
and
comment
a
proposed
rule
on
the
same
subject
on
two
previous
occasions
.
see

)
and

(

.
the
department
received
many
thoughtful
comments
from
members
of
the
bar
,
state
courts
,
bar
counsel
,
federal
and
state
prosecutors
and
others
during
those
comment
periods
.
the
current
version
of
the
proposed
rule
includes
substantial
revisions
based
on
those
comments
.
accordingly
,
the
department
is
issuing
the
rule
again
for
comments
to
ensure
that
all
the
interested
parties
have
an
opportunity
to
comment
.
this
proposal
reflects
the
departments
commitment
to
fostering
ethical
behavior
consistent
with
the
principles
informing
dr
7104a1
)
of
the
aba
code
of
professional
responsibility
and
rule
42
of
the
model
rules
of
professional
conduct
,
while
setting
forth
clear
and
uniform
national
guidelines
upon
which
federal
attorneys
can
rely
in
carrying
out
their
responsibilities
to
enforce
federal
laws
.
the
regulations
make
clear
that
federal
attorneys
generally
continue
to
be
subject
to
state
bar
ethical
rules
where
they
are
licensed
to
practice
,
except
in
the
limited
circumstances
where
state
ethical
rules
clearly
conflict
with
lawful
federal
procedures
and
practices
.
with
respect
to
willful
violations
of
the
contacts
rules
as
embodied
in
the
attorney
generals
proposed
regulations
,
federal
attorneys
would
remain
subject
to
state
bar
disciplinary
sanctions
.
this
new
proposal
is
the
product
of
extensive
review
,
comments
and
vigorous
debate
among
judges
,
federal
government
attorneys
,
members
of
the
private
bar
,
disciplinary
officials
,
academics
and
ethicists
.
in
essence
,
the
proposed
regulations
would
permit
federal
prosecutors
and
agents
to
continue
to
conduct
criminal
and
civil
investigations
in
routine
fashion
against
all
individuals
,
whether
or
not
those
persons
are
represented
by
counsel
.
they
would
allow
department
attorneys
to
continue
to
make
or
direct
undercover
or
overt
contacts
with
individuals
and
organizations
represented
by
counsel
for
the
purpose
of
developing
factual
information
up
until
the
point
at
which
they
are
arrested
or
charged
with
a
crime
or
named
as
defendants
in
a
civil
law
enforcement
action
.
however
,
the
regulations
generally
would
not
permit
federal
prosecutors
to
attempt
to
negotiate
plea
agreements
,
settlements
or
similar
arrangements
with
individuals
represented
by
counsel
outside
of
the
presence
or
without
the
consent
of
their
attorneys
.
these
regulations
also
would
preclude
,
with
certain
very
narrow
exceptions
,
any
contacts
with
represented
parties
after
an
arrest
,
indictment
,
or
the
filing
of
a
complaint
on
the
subject
matter
of
the
representation
.
the
principal
exception
to
these
general
prohibitions
occurs
when
the
defendant
voluntarily
and
knowingly
initiates
a
contact
with
the
government
attorney
,
in
which
case
the
regulations
would
require
the
government
attorney
to
take
the
matter
before
a
district
judge
or
magistrate
judge
to
obtain
approval
for
the
communication
or
to
obtain
the
appointment
of
substitute
counsel
for
the
defendant
.
the
united
states
attorneys
'
manual
will
set
forth
further
guidance
.
the
proposed
manual
provisions
,
which
are
set
out
in
their
entirety
at
the
end
of
this
commentary
,
prohibit
overt
approaches
by
federal
attorneys
to
represented
targets
of
criminal
or
civil
enforcement
proceedings
without
the
consent
of
counsel
,
unless
certain
enumerated
exceptions
are
met
.
the
manual
also
will
require
that
government
attorneys
receive
approval
from
their
supervisors
before
communicating
with
any
represented
party
or
represented
target
.
since
early
in
this
century
,
the
rules
of
professional
conduct
that
govern
attorneys
have
required
that
lawyers
for
one
party
in
a
dispute
communicate
only
through
an
adverse
partys
lawyer
,
rather
than
directly
.
