the
application
states
that
making
the
fund
available
for
mixed
and
shared
funding
will
encourage
more
insurance
companies
to
offer
variable
contracts
,
and
that
this
should
result
in
increased
competition
with
respect
to
both
variable
contract
design
and
pricing
,
which
can
be
expected
to
result
in
more
product
variation

lower
charges

mixed
and
shared

should
provide
several
benefits

a

portion

would
provide

permitting
increased
