under

regulations
,
aphis
allows
certain
fruits
to
be
imported
into
the

if
they
undergo
sustained
refrigeration
(

cold

temperature
and

requirements
vary
according
to
the
type

and
the

involved
.
on
05/13/1994
,
we
published
in
the
federal
register
(
59
fr
2496824971
,
docket
no
.
931212
)
a
proposal
to
amend
the
regulations
to
allow
the
cold
treatment
of
imported
fruits
upon
arrival
at
the
port
of
wilmington
,
nc
.
we
also
proposed
to
delete
the
listings
of
cold
treatments
in
the
regulations
and
replace
them
with
a
reference
to
the
cold
treatments
in
the
plant
protection
and
quarantine
treatment
manual
,
which
is
incorporated
by
reference
.
we
also
proposed
to
make
a
nonsubstantive
editorial
change
.
we
solicited
comments
concerning
our
proposal
for
a
30day
day
comment
period
ending
06/13/1994
.
we
received
two
comments
by
that
date
.
one
,
from
a
state
agency
,
supports
the
rule
.
the
other
comment
,
from
a
port
authority
,
asked
that
we
continue
to
consider
allowing
cold
treatment
to
be
conducted
at
gulfport
,
ms
.
we
are
still
considering
whether
to
allow
cold
treatment
to
be
conducted
at
gulfport
.
therefore
,
based
on
the
rationale
set
forth
in
the
proposed
rule
and
in
this
document
,
we
are
adopting
the
provisions
of
the
proposal
as
a
final
rule
without
change
.
executive
order
12866
and
regulatory
flexibility
act
this
rule
has
been
reviewed
under
executive
order
12866
.
the
rule
has
been
determined
to
be
not
significant
for
purposes
of
executive
order
12866
,
and
,
therefore
,
has
not
been
reviewed
by
the
office
of
management
and
budget
.
we
are
allowing
,
under
certain
conditions
,
the
cold
treatment
of
imported
fruit
upon
arrival
at
the
port
of
wilmington
,
nc
.
as
a
result
of
this
action
,
a
number
of
different
fruits
could
be
imported
into
wilmington
,
nc
.
specifically
,
officials
of
the
north
carolina
state
ports
authority
in
wilmington
,
nc
,
anticipate
that
apples
,
grapes
,
and
pears
from
argentina
,
brazil
,
and
south
africa
will
be
imported
and
cold
treated
at
the
port
of
wilmington
,
nc
.
approximately
20
million
pounds
of
each
fruit
could
be
imported
annually
into
wilmington
,
nc
,
as
a
result
of
this
action
,
though
we
anticipate
the
amount
will
be
much
smaller
.
while
some
of
the
fruit
arriving
at
wilmington
,
nc
,
will
be
imported
in
addition
to
the
present
volume
of
annual
imports
into
the
united
states
,
some
will
be
shipments
diverted
from
other
ports
also
approved
to
conduct
cold
treatment
on
arrival
.
in
the
following
analysis
of
the
potential
impact
of
this
action
on
domestic
producers
of
apples
,
grapes
and
pears
,
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
greatest
possible
economic
impact
,
we
have
assumed
that
the
maximum
amount
of
fruit
will
be
imported
into
wilmington
,
nc
,
for
cold
treatment
,
and
further
,
that
those
commodities
will
be
imported
in
addition
to
the
present
volume
of
annual
imports
into
the
united
states
.
