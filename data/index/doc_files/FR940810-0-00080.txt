the
national
roofing
contractors
association
(
nrca
)
cited
four
reasons
not
to
require
wetting
on
roofs
:
`
the
introduction
of
water
on
the
roof
creates
safety
hazards
,
such
as
slipping
;
water
on
the
roof
can
enter
the
building
and
cause
damage
and
electrical
hazards
;
the
introduction
of
water
on
the
roof
can
damage
the
roof
system
(
eg
,
by
soaking
insulation
boards
;
the
sri
international
study
reveals
that
roofing
work
involving
wetting
does
not
appear
to
produce
either
higher
or
lower
concentrations
than
work
performed
dry
.
we
believe
this
is
because
of
the
nature
of
roof
systems
.
they
are
applied
and
in
place
to
repel
water
.
thus
,
water
(
amended
or
unamended
)
does

some
participants
suggested
that
using
wet
methods
on
roofs
should
be
recommended
,
but
not
required
,
because
of
safety
concerns
.
for
instance
,
the
asbestos
administrator
for
florida
,
noted
that
using
wet
methods
on
a
sloped
roof
may
be
more
of
a
hazard
to
the
workers
,
than
the
benefits
gained
(

.

.
in
contrast
,
niosh
recommended
that
before
an
operation
(

asbestos

,
the
roof
should
be
wetted
with
water
or
other
wetting
agent
(

bctd
noted
in
its
posthearing
hearing
brief
that
`
the
majority
of
the
jobs
reported
in
the
sri
study
,
submitted
by

,
employed
wet
methods

various

noted
that
power
cutting

built
roofing
is
the
standard
method
used
to
remove
roofing
material
.
use
of
this
method
generates
dust
which
may
contain
asbestos
(
ex
.
1357
,
795
,
796
,
7115
.
the
paik
study
and
other
evidence
demonstrate
that
wetting
does
substantially
reduce
exposure
.
osha
believes
that
continuous
misting
of
the
cutting
blade
during
the
cutting
operation
,
whether
performed
by
hand
or
by
machine
will
help
to
control
dust
.
field
observations
of
such
procedures
have
shown
that
little
water
is
pooled
as
a
result
of
the
misting
process
(
ex
.
1313
,
and
that
in
most
circumstances
,
evaporation
will
quickly
occur
.
therefore
,
osha
does
not
believe
that
the
requirement
to
mist
the
cutting
blade
will
create
a
slipping
hazard
on
roofs
under
most
circumstances
.
if
,
however
,
a
competent
person
determines
that
the
specific
conditions
of
a
roofing
job
(
eg
.
a
steeply
sloping
roof
,
or
below
freezing
temperatures
)
combined
with
the
water
resulting
from
any
misting
,
would
create
a
slipping
hazard
,
misting
may
be
omitted
,
if
other
precautions
are
followed
,
such
as
equipping
the
power
tool
with
a
hepa
vacuum
system
,
or
using
hand
methods
