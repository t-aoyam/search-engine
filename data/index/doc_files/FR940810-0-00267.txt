substance
:
`
asbestos

is
the
name
of
a
class
of
magnesiumsilicate
magnesium

minerals
that
occur

are

asbestos
is
and
was
used
in
the
manufacture
of

clothing
,
automotive

,
and
a

asbestos
is
also
present
in
pipe
and
boiler
insulation
materials
and
in
sprayedon
sprayed
on

located
on

in

and
between

.
c
.
the
potential
for
an
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
product
to
release
breathable
fibers
depends
largely
on
its
degree
of
friability
.
friable
means
that
the
material
can
be
crumbled
with
hand
pressure
and
is
therefore
likely
to
emit
fibers
.
the
fibrous
fluffy
sprayedon
sprayed
on
materials
used
for
fireproofing
,
insulation
,
or
sound
proofing
are
considered
to
be
friable
,
and
they
readily
release
airborne
fibers
if
disturbed
.
materials
such
as
vinylasbestos
vinyl
asbestos
floor
tile
or
roofing
felt
are
considered
nonfriable
friable
if
intact
and
generally
do
not
emit
airborne
fibers
unless
subjected
to
sanding
,
sawing
and
other
aggressive
operations
.
asbestoscement
pipe
or
sheet
can
emit
airborne
fibers
if
the
materials
are
cut
or
sawed
,
or
if
they
are
broken
.
d
.
permissible
exposure
:
exposure
to
airborne
asbestos
fibers
may
not
exceed
01
fibers
per
cubic
centimeter
of
air
(
01
f

)
averaged
over
the
8hour
hour

,
and
1

averaged
over

health
hazard
data
a
.
asbestos
can
cause
disabling
respiratory
disease
and
various
types
of
cancers
if
the
fibers
are
inhaled
.
inhaling
or
ingesting
fibers
from
contaminated
clothing
or
skin
can
also
result
in
these
diseases
.
the
symptoms
of
these
diseases
generally
do
not
appear
for
20
or
more
years
after
initial
exposure
.
b
.
exposure
to
asbestos
has
been
shown
to
cause
lung
cancer
,
mesothelioma
,
and
cancer
of
the
stomach
and
colon
.
mesothelioma
is
a
rare
cancer
of
the
thin
membrane
lining
of
the
chest
and
abdomen
.
symptoms
of
mesothelioma
include
shortness
of
breath
,
pain
in
the
walls
of
the
chest
,
and
or
abdominal
pain
.

respirators
:
you
are
required
to
wear
a
respirator
when
performing
tasks
that
result
in
asbestos
exposure
that
exceeds
the
permissible
exposure
limit
(

of

performing
certain
designated
operations

respirators
must

is
required
to
conduct

respirators
should
not

in
work
situations
where
their
use
is
required
