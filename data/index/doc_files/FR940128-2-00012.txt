allege
that
`
critical
circumstances
'
exist
with
respect
to
imports
of
wssp
from
malaysia
.
section
735a3
)
of
the
act
provides
that
critical
circumstances
exist
if
we
determine
that
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe
or
suspect
that
:
(
ai
)
there
is
a
history
of
dumping
in
the
united
states
or
elsewhere
of
the
class
or
kind
of
merchandise
which
is
the
subject
of
the
investigation
,
or
(
ii
)
the
person
by
whom
,
or
for
whose
account
,
the
merchandise
was
imported
knew
or
should
have
known
that
the
exporter
was
selling
the
merchandise
which
is
the
subject
of
the
investigation
at
less
than
its
fair
value
,
and
(
b
)
there
have
been
massive
imports
of
the
class
or
kind
of
merchandise
which
is
the
subject
of
the
investigation
over
a
relatively
short
period
.
regarding
a
history
of
dumping
,
petitioners
have
argued
that
the
existence
of
us
.
antidumping
orders
on
wssp
from
taiwan
and
korea
is
sufficient
for
the
department
to
find
a
history
of
dumping
in
this
case
.
however
,
the
departments
practice
in
this
area
is
to
consider
only
those
orders
on
subject
merchandise
from
the
country
under
investigation
as
sufficient
evidence
of
a
history
of
dumping
.
consequently
,
because
there
have
been
no
antidumping
orders
on
wssp
from
malaysia
,
we
find
no
history
of
dumping
.
in
determining
whether
any
importer
had
knowledge
of
dumping
,
we
normally
consider
margins
of
25
percent
or
more
sufficient
to
impute
knowledge
of
dumping
under
section
735e1a
)
of
the
act
when
usp
is
based
on
purchase
price
.
because
the
final
dumping
margin
for
kt
is
less
than
25
percent
,
we
do
not
impute
importer
knowledge
of
sales
at
less
than
fair
value
,
under
section
735a3aii
)
of
the
act
.
since
the
criteria
necessary
to
find
the
existence
of
critical
circumstances
under
section
735a3a
)
are
not
present
,
we
do
not
need
to
determine
whether
imports
of
subject
merchandise
have
been
massive
over
a
relatively
short
period
,
in
accordance
with
section
735a3b
)
of
the
act
.
accordingly
,
we
determine
that
critical
circumstances
do
not
exist
with
respect
to
imports
of
wssp
from
malaysia
.

:
petitioners
argue
that
kt
was
unable
to
substantiate
its
cost
data
at
verification
.
as
a
result
,
petitioners
contend
that
these

are
unusable
and
the
department
is
required
to
reject
kts
cost
data
completely
and
base
the
final
determination
on
bia
.
petitioners
maintain
that
,
under
the
statute
and
the
departments
regulations
,
the
department
must
use
bia
to
set
antidumping
duty
margins
whenever
a
respondent
`
refuses
or
is
unable
to
produce
information
requested
in
a
timely
manner
and
in

,

otherwise

impedes

petitioners
further
assert
