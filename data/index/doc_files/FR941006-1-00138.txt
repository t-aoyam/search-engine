as

under

under

the
act
provides
fda
with
broad
authority
to
ensure
that
food
is
safe
and
wholesome
.
in
particular
,
the
act
prohibits
the
adulteration
of
food
in
sections
301
and

(

331

in

(

and
402a2c
,
that
all
food
additives
be
listed
for
use
by
fda
before
they
are
added
to
food
.
in
section
409a
,
the
act
deems
a
food
additive
to
be
unsafe
unless
its
use
conforms
to
the
conditions
specified
in
the
listing
regulation
.
these
conditions
include
,
but
are
not
limited
to
,
specifications
as
to
the
particular
food
or
classes
of
food
to
which
the
additive
may
be
added
,
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
additive
may
be
added
to

and
any
directions

other
labeling

requirements
for
such
additive
deemed
necessary
to
ensure
the
safety
of
such
use
(
section
409c1a
)
of
the
act
.
thus
,
under
the
act
,
the
agency
is
authorized
to
specify
packaging
requirements
for
a
food
additive
when
it
finds
that
use
of
such
packaging
is
necessary
to
ensure
the
safe
use
of
the
additive
.
in
section
201s
,
the
act
provides
an
exemption
to
the
food
additive
definition
for
substances
that
are
generally
recognized
as
safe
(
gras
)
under
the
conditions
of
their
intended
use
.
fda
has
issued
regulations
delineating
conditions
under
which
use
of
certain
substances
is
gras
.
if
the
conditions
of
a
particular
use
of
a
substance
are
not
those
that
are
generally
recognized
as
safe
,
the
use
is
not
gras
,
but
subject
to
regulation
under
the
food
additives
provisions
of
the
act

should
fda
determine
that
a
particular
type
of
packaging
is
necessary
to
ensure
the
safe
use
of
iron
substances
in
dietary
supplements
,
either
as
gras
substances
or
as
listed
food
additives
,
then
any
use
of
iron
substances
in
dietary
supplements
that
does
not
involve
use
of
that
type
of
packaging
would
constitute
a
use
of
an
unapproved
food
additive

the
dietary

section
501a2b
)
of
the
act
(

351a2b
)
states
that
a
drug
shall
be
deemed
to
be
adulterated
if
the
methods
used
in
,
or
the
facilities
or
controls
used
for

or

do
not
conform
to
,
or
are
not
operated
or
administered
in
conformity
with
,
current
good
manufacturing
practice
to
assure
that
such
drug
meets
the
requirements
of
the
act
as
to
safety
and
has
the
identity
and
strength
,
and
meets
the
quality
and
purity
characteristics
,
which
it
purports
or
is
represented
to
possess
.
a
drug
product
may
be
safe
and
effective
as
manufactured
but
used
in
an
unsafe
and
ineffective
manner
.
current
good
manufacturing
practice
is
,
to
some
extent
,
an
evolving
standard
.
to
remain
`
current
'
a
manufacturer
must
take
into
account
advances
in
technology
as
well
as
new
information
about
the
use
of
the
product
including
,
but
not
limited
to
,
information
about
any
dangers
associated
with
use
of
the
drug
product
.
manufacturers
must
use
this
knowledge
to
alter
,
adapt
,
or
change
their
manufacturing
procedures
to
ensure
that
all
possible
measures
have
been
implemented
to
eliminate
known
dangers
.
therefore
,
advances
in
technology
and
new
information
about
dangers
associated
with
a
drug
product
can
mean
that
further
steps
by
the
manufacturer
are
necessary
to
guard
against
such
foreseeable
dangers
,
in
order
to
hold
the
drug
product
in
a
manner
that
ensures
its
safety
and
,
thus
,
comports
with
current
good
manufacturing
practice
.
