his
belief
that

im
not
sure
if

support

associated

osha
amended
the
definition
of
`
asbestos
'
from
the
1986
standards
.
the
nonasbestiform
asbestiform
varieties
of
the
minerals
actinolite
,
tremolite
and
anthophyllite
are
no
longer
included
in
the
definition
of
asbestos
.
in
1986
osha
determined
that
although
tremolite
,
actinolite
and
anthophyllite
exist
in
different
forms
,
all
forms
of
these
minerals
would
continue
to
be
regulated
.
following
promulgation
of
the
rule
,
several
parties
requested
an
administrative
stay
of
the
standard
claiming
that
osha
improperly
included
nonasbestiform
asbestiform
minerals
.
a
temporary
stay
insofar
as
the
standards
apply
to
the
nonasbestos
asbestos
forms
of
tremolite
,
actinolite
and
anthophyllite
was
granted
and
the
agency
initiated
rulemaking
,
proposing
to
remove
these
forms
from
the
scope
of
the
asbestos
standards
.
following
a
public
comment
period
and
public
hearing
,
osha
issued
its
final
decision
to
delete
nonasbestiform
asbestiform
tremolite
,
anthophyllite
and
actinolite
from
the
scope
of
the
asbestos

the

in

found
that

conclude
that

tremolite
,
anthophyllite

present
the

that
the
failure
to
regulate
them

(

osha
is
adding
definitions
for
four
classes
of
activities
which
trigger
different
provisions
in
the
standard

those
activities
presenting
the
greatest
risk
are
designated
class

with

to
each
successive
class
.
the
construction
and
shipyard
employment
standards
regulate
class
i

ii
and

work
;
all
three
standards
regulate
class
iv

`

thermal

based
on
the
record
,
osha
has
determined
that
the
prevalence
of
these
materials
and
their
likelihood
of
significant
fiber
release
when
disturbed
,
requires
rigorous
control
methods
which
osha
has
set
out
in
the
standards
.

work
practices

in
removing
these

incidental
cutting
away
of

amounts
(
less
than
a
