he
suggested
that
other
material
,
should
be
handled
as

unless
sampling
indicates
that
it
does
not
contain
asbestos
,
but
that
it
not

required
to
be

as
suggested
,
osha
considered
extending
its
presumption
requirement
to
other
kinds
of
building
materials
which
may
contain
asbestos
.
a
limited
extension
has
been
made
in
two
cases
.
because
of
its
accessibility
and
prevalence
,
the
frequent
difficulty
of
identifying
its
asbestos
content
and
the
frequency
of
maintenance
activity
which
may
disturb
it
matrix
.
the
agency
is
requiring
that
resilient
flooring
installed
before
1980
be
presumed
to
contain
asbestos
unless
rebutted
pursuant
to
the
standard
.

in

where

and
not

,
is
assumed
to
be

other
building
materials
which
may
contain
asbestos
such
as
roofing
material
,
ceiling
tiles
and
miscellaneous
products
listed
in
epas
`
green
book
'
have
not
been
found
to
be
both
as
widely
prevalent
and
easily
disturbed
and
damaged
as
are
tsi
and
surfacing
material
or
as
widely
prevalent
,
accessible
and
frequently
disturbed
as
resilient
flooring
.
therefore
,
osha
believes
little
additional
benefit
will
result
from
treating
all
such
building
materials
which
uncommonly
contain
asbestos
as
if
they
do
,
rather
than
concentrating
resources
on
protecting
employees
from
exposure
to
materials
when
there
is
actual
knowledge
or
reason
to
believe
they
contain
asbestos
.
osha
notes
in
this
regard
that
an
employer
or
building
owners
duty
to
investigate
the
possibility
that
a
material
contains
asbestos
is
stronger
when
the
consequences
of
failing
to
inquire
is
increased
hazard
to
employees
.
for
example
,
in
the
case
where
a
large
section
of
damaged
ceiling
tiles
installed
before
1980
is
to
be
removed
,
an
employer
may
not
ignore
the
possibility
that
the
tiles
are
asbestoscontaining
asbestos

.
by
not
including
some
building
materials
in
the
presumption
osha
is
not
reducing
an
employers
duty
to
exercise
`
due
diligence
'
when
exposing
employees
to
such
kinds
of
materials
.
the
agency
has
determined
merely
that
the
record
does
not
compel
the
adoption
of
a
presumption
for
such
materials
;
in
any
such
specific
case
,
circumstances
may
require
the
employer
or
building
owner
to
sample
and
analyze
building
materials
for
asbestos
content
,
or
to
treat
the
material
as
if
it
is
asbestoscontaining
asbestos

under
the
standard
.
on
a
different
issue
,
osha
is
not
specifying
in
the
regulatory
text
the
qualifications
of
the
person
who
may
designate
materials
as
pacm
.
under
ahera
,
inspections
are
required
to
be
conducted
by
certified
inspectors
(

see
recent
revisions
of

accreditation

.
the
agency
has
found
that
designation
of
the
kinds
of
building
materials
as
pacm
is
not
an
inspection
.
this
process
does
not
require
technical
training
:
thermal
system
insulation
is
easily
recognized
;
sprayed
on
or
troweled
on
surfacing
material
likewise
is
identifiable
.
neither
epas
revised
map
nor
osha
requires
specific
training
or
accreditation
of
persons
who
only
visually
inspect
the
condition
of
acm
pacm
.
osha
emphasizes
that
the
presumption
must
apply
even
where
it
appears
to
knowledgeable
building
personnel
,
that
material
is
not
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
and
is
composed
of
other
materials
,
such
as
fiberglass
.
therefore
,
osha
has
not
adopted
the
suggestion
of
some
participants
to
specify
that
certain
materials
such
as
fiberglass
and
neoprene
,
because
they
are
easily
identifiable
,
should
not
be
included
in
the
presumption
(
see
ex
.
16257
.
osha
notes
that
hei
distinguished
a
`
visual
survey
'
ie
,
the
identification
of
suspect
materials
from
more
complete
surveys
,
and
notes
that
`
this
type
of
survey
may
minimize
the
need
for
trained
consultants
'
(
hei
,
ex
.
1344
,
at

)
some
participants
suggested
that
osha
include
the
condition
of
the
material
in
its
`
highrisk
high
risk
'
category
to
be
subject
to
the
presumption
.
although
the
condition
of
the
material
influences
its
risk
potential
,
osha
continues
its
practice
of
not
distinguishing
materials
based
on
their
friability
.
however
,
the
condition
of
the
material
is
relevant
to
whether
debris
,
in
the
presence
of
acm
,
must
be
presumed
to
be
asbestos
containing
.
the
standard
requires
that
debris
in
an
enclosed
area
where
tsi
or
surfacing
acm
is
present
,
and
not
intact
,
be
presumed
to
be
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
.
osha
has
not
used
friability
to
distinguish
among
asbestos
containing
materials
.
first
,
osha
mainly
regulates
active
disturbances
of
asbestos
,
and
uses
exposure
levels
as
one
element
in
assigning
riskbased
risk
based
requirements
.
since
the
friability
of
material
will
influence
exposure
levels
,
friability
is
partly
subsumed
by
this
reference
to
exposure
levels
.
second
,
the
terms
precise
meaning
is
unclear
,
and
thus
,
confusing
to
the
regulated
community
.
the
epa
experience
in
distinguishing
risk
categories
based
on
friability
indicates
the
complexity
of
using
this
concept
.
in
1973
the
epaneshap
epa
neshap
had
regulated
only
friable
acm
,
but
later
issued
a
clarification
which
stated
:
*
*
*
*
*
even
though
the
regulations
address
only
material
that
is
presently
friable
,
it
does
not
limit
itself
to
material
that
is
friable
at
the
time
of
notification
.
rather
,
if
at
any
point
during
the
renovation
of
demolition
additional
friable
asbestos
material
is
*
*
*
*
*
*
created
from
nonfriable
friable
forms
,
this
additional
friable
material
becomes
subject
to
the
regulations
from
the
time
of
creation
(
ex
.
1239
,
p
.
48406
.
third
,
oshas
risk
categories
which
are
based
on
the
type
of
material
include
the
potential
for
friability
.
for
example
,
surfacing
material
is
loosely
bound
and
therefore
is
potentially
more
friable
than
are
other
materials
and
thus
is
considered
to
present
high
risk
.
