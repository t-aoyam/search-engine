osha
is
adding
a
definition
for
the
term
`
critical
barriers
'
whose
use
is
required
in
certain
asbestos
operations
.
these
are
defined
as
plastic
sheeting
or
equivalent
material
placed
over
openings
to
the
work
area
.
these
barriers
are
effective
when
they
seal
all
openings
into
a
work
area
.
critical
barriers
can
be
other
physical
barriers
sufficient
to
prevent
airborne
asbestos
in
a
work
area
from
migrating
to
an
adjacent
area
.
disturbance
osha
has
added
a
definition
for
`
disturbance
'
to
all
three
standards
to
distinguish
it
from
removal
.
in
this
definition
disturbance
means
any
contact
with
acm
pacm
which
releases
fibers
or
which
alters
its
position
or
arrangement
.
it
also
includes
operations
which
disrupt
the
matrix
or
render
it
friable
or
which
generate
visible
debris
from
it
.
a
quantitative
cutoff
of
disturbance
is
giventhe
amount
of
acm
pacm
so
disturbed
may
not
exceed
the
amount
that
can
be
contained
within
one
standard
sized
glove
bag
or
waste
bag
.
osha
believes
that
certain
jobs
,
eg
,
repairing
leaking
valves
,
often
require
asbestos
to
be
cut
away
to
gain
access
to
a
component
.
if
the
amount
of
asbestos
so
`
disturbed
'
is
contained
in
one
bag
,
class
i
precautions
are
not
necessary
.
glove
bag
the
term
`
glove
bag
'
is
also
defined
in
the
standards
as
a
plastic
baglike
bag
like
enclosure
affixed
around
acm
with
glovelike
glove
like
appendages
through
which
material
and
tools
may
be
handled
.
homogeneous
area
the
presumption
that
a
material
contains
asbestos
may
be
rebutted
by
sampling
a
`
homogeneous
'
area
of
the
presumed
acm
to
determine
its
asbestos
content
.
osha
has
defined
`
homogeneous
area
'
in
much
the
same
way
it
is
defined
by
epa
as
an
area
of
surfacing
material
or
thermal
system
insulation
that
is
uniform
in
color
and
texture
.
industrial
hygienist
a
definition
for
`
industrial
hygienist
'
is
included
in
the
standards
as
a
professional
person
qualified
by
education
,
training
,
and
experience
to
anticipate
,
recognize
,
evaluate
and
develop
controls
for
occupational
health
hazards
.
initial
exposure
assessment
`
initial
exposure
assessment
'
including
`
negative
initial
exposure
assessment
'
are
terms
used
in
the
construction
and
in
the
shipyard
standards
.
it
means
a
required
assessment
by
a
`
competent
person
'
concerning
the
exposure
potential
of
a
specific
asbestos
job
,
or
series
of
similar
asbestos
jobs
.
a
`
negative
initial
exposure
assessment
'
is
such
an
assessment
in
which
it
is
concluded
that
employee
exposures
during
the
job
are
likely
to
be
consistently
below
the
pels
.
assessments
must
be
based
on
information
and
data
which
are
allowed
pursuant
to
criteria
in
paragraph
(
f
.
the
results
of
`
initial
monitoring
'
no
longer
required
for
each
job
,
should
be
considered
,
but
do
not
necessarily
constitute
an
adequate
`
assessment
'
if
they
would
not
represent
all
worstcase
worst
case
employee
exposures
during
the
entire
job
.
modification
alternatives
or
modifications
to
listed
control
methods
are
allowed
when
the
employer
demonstrates
that
such
a
`
modification
'
still
provides
equivalent
worker
protection
.
osha
does
not
intend
that
changes
in
a
control
method
which
decrease
the
safety
margin
of
a
material
or
omitting
a
procedure
be
permitted
by
calling
it
a
`
modification
'
a
`
modification
'
means
a
changed
or
altered
procedure
,
material
which
replaces
a
procedure
,
material
or
component
of
a
required
system
.
for
example
,
a
new
test
proven
successful
in
detecting
leaks
might
be
substituted
for
required
`
smoke
tests
'
omission
of
a
procedure
or
component
,
or
a
reduction
in
the
stringency
or
strength
of
a
material

not

asbestos

in

osha
bases
this
on
the
record
,
including
the
hei
report
which
states
that
`
thermal

insulation
and
surface
treatments
(
fireproofing

acoustical
and
decorative

although
these
materials
may
have
been
installed
in
small
quantities
after
1980
,
osha
finds
that
their
installation
is
unlikely
after
that
date

project
designer
osha
has
adopted
a
definition
like
that
of

for
a
`

_
a
person
who
has
successfully
completed
the
training
requirements

removal
`
removal
'
means
all
operations
where
acm
and
or
pacm
is
removed
from
a
building
component
,
regardless
of
the
reason
for
the
removal
.
it
includes
those
maintenance
,
repair
,
renovation
and
demolition
activities
where
acm
and
or
pacm
removal
is
incidental
to
the
primary
reason
for
the
project
,
as
well
as
where
removal
of
acm
and
or
pacm
is
the
primary
reason
for
the
project
.
removal
should
be
distinguished
from
`
disturbance
'
which
includes
`
cutting
away
'
a
small
amount
of
acm
or
pacm
.
