sesac
agreed
that
asbestos
operations
should
be
overseen
by
personnel
who
have
the
qualifications
to
ensure
that
asbestos
operations
are
performed
safely
;
however
,
they
noted
in

(

that

has
been
used
to
refer
to
a
person
who
is
uniquely
qualified
to
perform

preparatory
to
entering

and
confined
spaces
and
felt
that
the
use
of
this
term
as
employed
in
the
asbestos
standard
would
cause
confusion
.
they
suggested
that
the
competent
person
be
called
a
`
qualified
'
person
in
the
shipyard
standard
.
osha
does
not
object
to
this
substitution
of
terms
,
but
notes
that
all
requirements
for
competent
qualified
persons
)
are
to
be
equivalent
.
sesac
also
pointed
to
a
process
which
may
be
the
general
case
in
large
operations
,
in
which
the
duties
of
the
shipyard
qualified
person
are
shared
or
divided
between
two
or
more
persons
.
that
is
,
in
some
of
the
larger
companies
represented
on
the
committee
,
a
training
department
(
not
a
person
)
is
responsible
for
ensuring
that
employees
are
trained
and
another
department
is
responsible
for
setting
up
the
regulated
area
,
while
an
industrial
hygiene
department
conducts
all
monitoring
.
sesac
recommended
that
this
be
specifically
allowed
.
osha
feels
that
the
current
regulatory
language
permits
utilizing
this
organization
of
responsibilities
and
agrees
with
the
suggestion
that
it
is
appropriate
for

with
respect
to
the
appendices
to
the
standard
,
sesac
recommended
inclusion
of
the
appendix
dealing
with
work
practices
and
engineering
controls
for
automotive
brake
and
clutch
repair
and
assembly
in
the

osha
agrees
that
this
appendix
is
appropriate
to
the
shipyard
employment
standard
,
since
these
activities
occur
within
shipyards
and
has
included
this
as
appendix

in
the
shipyard

standard

osha
further
notes
that
this
appendix
has
been
amended
subsequent
to
consideration
by
sesac
,
and
therefore
differs
from
the
alternate
regulatory
language
suggested
by

.
for
example
,
the
agency
no
longer
considers
the
solvent
spray
can
a
preferred
method
for
controlling
asbestos
contamination
and
will
not
include
it
in
either
standard

all
changes
indicated
in

are
to
be

are
the

for

at
the

a
phrase
:
`

or
the
most

'
this
change
is
made
to
assure
that
the

followed
are
the
most
current

available

appendix

has
been
updated

the
most
current

this

that
there
would
