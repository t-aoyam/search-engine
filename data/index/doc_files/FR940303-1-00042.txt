has
developed
two
different
calcium
content
levels
for
this
purpose
.
both
of
these
levels
account
for
the
fact
that
poultry
tissues
,
other
than
bone
,
contain
some
calcium
.
the
higher
level0
235
percentreflects
the
greater
proportion
of
calcium
in
the
bones
of
mature
chickens
and
turkeys
as
compared
with
young
chickens
(
ie
,
the
lower
ratio
of
bone

the

175
percenthas
been
used
by
fsis
in
enforcing
the
one

both
of
these
calcium
levels
are
equivalent
to
one

since

is

tentative

the
maximum
for
all
mdp
that
is

fsis
is
interested

comments

the
calcium
levels
applicable
to
mdp
made
from
other
kinds
of
poultry
,
eg
,
ducks
,

,
and

,
especially
calcium
levels
applicable
to

poultry
.
in

,
the
`

'
(
section

,

)
has
been
revised
to
include
a
procedure
that
could
be
applied
to
mechanically
deboned
product
made
only
in
part
from
mature
chickens
.
that
procedure
involves
a
determination
of
the
relative
mature
and
young
chicken
proportions
when
product
is
made
from
a
combination
of
young
and
mature
chickens
.
fsis
is
considering
,
as
discussed
below
,
that
production
of
mdp
under
an
approved
quality
control
program
is
necessary
to
assure
consistent
compliance
with
regulatory
requirements
,
including
the
calcium
content
requirement
utilized
in
restricting
bone
solids
content
.
therefore
,
as
the
discussion
of
the
proposed
quality
control
provision
indicates
,
fsiss
tentative
position
is
that
,
if
mechanically
deboned
chicken
is
made
from
a
combination
of
young
and
mature
chickens
,
the
application
of
any
intermediate
value
between
0
175
and
0
235
percent
in
verifying
compliance
would
be
contingent
upon
an
establishments
program
for
quality
control
including
methods
that
support
such
values
appropriateness
as
a
measure
of
a
bone
solids
content
to
not
more
than
one
percent
;
and
without
such
methods
,
the
0
175
percent
limit
should
apply
.
fsis
wishes
to
receive
comments
on
the
determination
of
the
calcium
levels
associated
with
mdp
made
from
a
combination
of
young
and
mature
poultry
.
the
inclusion
of
these
calcium
content
levels
in
the
definition
and
standard
fsis
is
considering
should
not
be
misinterpreted
as
indicating
a
concern
about
the
amount
of
the
essential
nutrient
calcium
that
is
provided
by
poultry
and
meat
food
products
.
fsis
agrees
with
the
findings
in
the
1979
health
and
safety
report
that
,
even
assuming
all
further
processed
poultry
were
made
with
mechanically
deboned
poultry
(
ie
,
a
far
greater
level
of
production
and
use
than
actually
occurs
,
the
projected
calcium
contribution
such
products
would
represent
only
a
negligible
increase
in
per
capita
daily
intakes
and
cannot
be
considered
hazardous
,
particularly
since
the
dietary
intake
of
a
large
sector
of
the
population
may
be
below
the
recommended
level
of
calcium
consumption
.

tentative
position
:
bone
particle
size
.
fsis
is
considering
restricting
the
size
of
the
bone
particles
in
mdp
to
a
maximum
of
less
than
15
millimeter
(
mm
)
in
the
greatest
dimension
,
but
permitting
up
to
5
bone
particles
per
50
grams
of
mdp
to
be
from
15
mm
to
less
to
2
mm
in
the
greatest
dimension
.
the
need
to
limit
the
size
of
bone
particles
in
mdp
has
been
acknowledged
since
the
poultry
industry
began
to
use
mechanical
methods
for
manufacturing
this
product
.
in
the
1979
health
and
safety
report
,
it
was
recommended
that
bone
particle
size
be
controlled
to
ensure
that
equipment
type
of
processing
does
not
result
in
unacceptably
large
fragments
and
concluded
that
,
provided
this
is
done
,
the
bone
particles
in
the
product
will
not
present
any
health
hazard
because
of
size
or
hardness
.
fsis
is
considering
that
it
is
appropriate
to
permit
up
to
5
particles
per
50
grams
of
product
to
be
from
15
mm
to
less
than
2
mm
as
an
acceptable
defect
in
complying
product
.
fsis
is
requesting
comments
and
information
on
the
extent
to
which
manufacturers
should
be
required
to
control
the
production
of
mechanically
separated
poultry
product
to
limit
the
size
of
bone
particles
.
fsis
will
consider
any
information
submitted
during
the
comment
period
on
the
size
and
distribution
of
bone
particles
that
may
occur
with
various
mechanical
deboning
procedures
conducted
in
accordance
with
good
manufacturing
practices
(
eg
,
the
extent
to
which
deviations
or
nonconforming
particles
occur
,
and
data
substantiating
the
absence
of
potential
health
or
finished
product
quality
problems
with
such
particles
.
