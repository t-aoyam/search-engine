the

did

,
although
they
did

,
had

congress

,
and
has
authorized

.
moreover
,
federal
regulations
implementing
the
commercial
motor
vehicle
safety
act
of
1986
and
its
commercial
drivers
license
provisions
,
have
further
helped
detect
drivers
operating
in

who
did
not
meet
the
federal
physical

vision
waiver
study
at
the
same
time
that
these
enforcement
efforts
were
increasing
,
heightened
awareness
of
the
rights
of
disabled
individuals
,
and
the
fact
that
some
of
the
physical
qualification
standards
were
absolute
in
that
they
permitted
no
demonstration
of
ability
notwithstanding
the
physical
deficit
,
caused
the
fhwa
to
reexamine
its
vision
standard
.
several
research
studies
,
although
acknowledging
that
visual
capacity
was
an
essential
element
of
safe
commercial
vehicle
operation
,
had
failed
to
fully
resolve
the
issue
of
what
level
of
visual
capacity
would
be
required
to
assure
safety
.
the
fhwa
decided
to
conduct
a
further
study
in
an
attempt
to
gather
essential
information
that
would
lead
to
an
improved
standard
.
the
difficulties
with
some
of
the
previous
studies
included
insufficient
subjects
and
the
absence
of
exposure
data
.
the
fhwa
believed
these
difficulties
could
be
overcome
,
in
part
,
by
using
as
subjects
drivers
who
,
although
they
did
not
meet
the
federal
vision
standards
,
had
been
safely
operating
cmvs
for
some
time
and
were
now
,
for
the
reasons
mentioned
above
,
becoming
more
readily
identifiable
.
the
fhwa
announced
its
vision
waiver
study
in
a
notice
of
intent
to
accept
applications
for
waivers
on
03/25/1992
,

the
intent
of

program
was
to
obtain
valuable
information
on
the
relationship
between
visual
capacity
and
the
ability
to
operate
a

safely

this

was
initiated
as

an

regulatory
review
of
