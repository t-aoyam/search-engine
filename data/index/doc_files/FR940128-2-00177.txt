,
the
administrator
hereby
issues
his
final
order
based
on
the
investigative
file
and
respondents
written
statement
.
the
acting
administrator
finds
that
in
02/19/1984
in
rabun
county
,
georgia
,
respondent
was
indicted
on
twentyone
twenty
one
felony
counts
of
violating
the
georgia
controlled
substances
act
.
the
indictment
was
based
on
respondents
issuing
prescriptions
for
various
schedule
iii
controlled
substances
for
other
than
legitimate
medical
purposes
.
by
order
dated
02/16/1984
,
the
composite
state
board
of
medical
examiners
of
the
state
of
georgia
(
georgia
board
)
concluded
that
respondents
ability
to
practice
medicine
posed
a
threat
to
the
public
health
,
safety
and
welfare
,
and
determined
that
emergency
action
was
required
.
the
georgia
board
therefore
ordered
respondent
to
surrender
his
dea
certificate
of
registration
,
and
any
triplicate
prescription
forms
and
order
forms
.
in
addition
,
the
georgia
board
suspended
respondents
license
to
practice
medicine
in
the
state
of
georgia
.
on
02/17/1984
,
respondent
surrendered
his
dea
certificate
of
registration
,
as1270660
.
respondent
pled
guilty
to
all
twentyone
twenty
one
felony
counts
and
,
on
03/07/1984
,
was
sentenced
to
ten
years
probation
,
ordered
to
pay
$
12000
and
prohibited
from
returning
to
the
mountain
judicial
circuit
for
the
period
of
probation
.
the
investigative
file
reveals
that
on
10/11/1990
,
respondent
appeared
before
the
georgia
board
to
request
reinstatement
of
his
medical
license
.
on
12/26/1990
,
the
georgia
board
notified
respondent
of
its
decision
to
deny
his
request
.
the
investigative
file
also
indicates
that
respondent
is
authorized
by
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
to
handle
controlled
substances
.
in
his
letter
of
05/19/1993
,
respondent
explained
that
he
was
currently
practicing
medicine
in
ponce
,
puerto
rico
.
respondent
also
alleged
that
in
1984
,
he
issued
numerous
prescriptions
for
controlled
substances
at
the
bequest
of
the
georgia
bureau
of
investigation
(
gbi
.
respondent
claimed
that
he
was
working
in
cooperation
with
the
gbi
in
the
gbis
effort
to
`
break
a
ring
of
drug
and
arms
'
trafficking
.
the
acting
administrator
finds
,
however
,
that
the
investigative
file
,
which
contains
voluminous
reports
from
the
gbi
,
does
not
support
respondents
assertion
that
he
wrote
the
prescriptions
at
issue
at
the
direction
of
the
gbi
.
on
the
contrary
,
the
investigative
file
indicates
that
the
gbi
had
received
information
that
respondent
was
issuing
prescriptions
without
valid
medical
reason
and
commenced
an
investigation
.
special
agents
from
the
gbi
conducted
several
undercover
operations
and
were
able
to
obtain
prescriptions
from
respondent
in
the
absence
of
a
legitimate
medical
purpose
.
section
823f
)
of
the
controlled
substances
act
lists
five
factors
which
are
to
be
considered
when
making
a
determination
as
to
whether
a
registration
would
be
in
the
public
interest
.
these
factors
include
:
(
1
)
the
recommendation
of
the
appropriate
state
licensing
board
or
professional
disciplinary
authority
;
(
2
)
the
applicants
experience
in
dispensing
,
or
conducting
research
with
respect
to
controlled
substances
;
(
3
)
the
applicants
conviction
record
under
federal
or
state
laws
relating
to
the
manufacture
,
distribution
,
or
dispensing
of
controlled
substances
;
(

)
compliance
with

state
,
federal

to
controlled
substances
;
and
,
(
5
)
such
other
conduct
which
may
threaten
the
public
health
and
safety
.
the
administrator
may
rely
on
any
one
or
any
combination
of
these
factors
when
determining
whether
an
application
should
be
denied
or
a
registration
revoked
