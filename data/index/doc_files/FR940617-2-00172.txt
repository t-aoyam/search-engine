nscc
has
prepared
summaries

in

of

most
significant
aspects
of

a

self

statement
of
the
purpose
of
,
and
statutory
basis
for
,
the
proposed
rule
change
the
purpose
of
the
rule
change
is
to
modify
nsccs
fee
structure
as
it
relates
to
correction
fees
for
the
processing
of
municipal
securities
transactions
to
reflect
the
fact
that
correction
capabilities
have
been
accelerated
in
conformity
with
comparison
capabilities
.
in
august
of
1993
,
nscc
accelerated
the
comparison
processing
for
municipal
securities
transactions
to
the
date
after
trade
date
(
t1
.
previously
nscc
had
charged
participants
for
supplemental
input
on
or
after
t2
.
because
correction
processing
can
now
be
initiated
on
t1
,
the
nscc
fee
structure
is
being
modified
in
order
to
charge
participants
for
supplemental
input
on
or
after
t1
.
although
the
acceleration
of
municipal
bond
comparison
occurred
in
august
of
1993
,
this
fee
change
will
be
effective
for
supplemental
comparison
processing
as
of
06/01/1994
.
the
proposed
rule
change
provides
for
the
equitable
allocation
of
dues
,
fees
,
and
charges
among
participants
.
therefore
,
nscc
believes
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
the
act
,
particularly
section
17ab3d
)
of
the
act
.
b

will
not
have
any
impact
or
impose
a
burden
on
competition
.
