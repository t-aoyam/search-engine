introduction
the
declared
purpose
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
(
osh
)
act
of
1970
is
`
*
*
*
*
*
to
assure
so
far
as
possible
every
working
man
and
woman
in
the
nation
safe
and
healthful
working
conditions
and
to
preserve
our
human
resources
*
*
*
*
*
'
thus
,
the
act
requires
the
secretary
of
labor
,
when
promulgating
occupational
safety
and
health
standards
for
toxic
materials
or
harmful
physical
agents
,
to
set
the
standard
`
`
*
*
*
*
*
*
that
most
adequately
assures
,
to
the
extent
feasible
,
on
the
basis
of
the
best
available
evidence
,
that
no
employee
will
suffer
material
impairment
of
health
or
functional
capacity
*
*
*
*
*
'
on
the
basis
of
this
congressional
directive
,
osha
has
responded
to
the
court
of
appeals
by
issuing
a
final
revision
to
the
asbestos
standard
,
the
intent
of
which
is
to
further
reduce
the
adverse
health
effects
associated
with
occupational
exposure
to
asbestos
.
this
chapter
reviews
regulatory
and
nonregulatory
regulatory
alternatives
that
osha
considered
and
found
to
be
inadequate
for
full
remediation
of
the
occupational
hazards
of
asbestos
.
private
markets
and
occupational
health
economic
theory
suggests
that
the
need
for
government
regulation
is
greatly
reduced
where
private
markets
work
efficiently
and
effectively
to
allocate
health
and
safety
resources
.
the
theory
typically
assumes
perfectly
competitive
labor
markets
where
workers
,
having
perfect
knowledge
of
job
risks
and
being
perfectly
mobile
among
jobs
,
command
wage
premiums
that
fully
compensate
for
any
risk
of
future
harm
.
thus
,
theoretically
,
the
costs
of
occupational
injury
and
illness
are
borne
initially
by
the
firms
responsible
for
the
hazardous
workplace
conditions
and
,
ultimately
,
by
the
consumers
who
pay
higher
prices
for
the
final
goods
and
services
produced
by
these
firms
.
with
all
costs
internalized
,
private
employers
have
an
incentive
to
reduce
hazards
wherever
the
cost
of
hazard
abatement
is
less
than
the
cost
of
the
expected
injury
or
illness
.
the
resultant
level
of
safety
and
health
is
considered
`
efficient
'
in
the
sense
that
it
minimizes
the
sum
of
the
costs
of
hazard
prevention
and
of
injury
or
illness
.
perfectly
competitive
labor
markets
,
however
,
do
not
exist
for
many
industrial
markets
.
osha
,
therefore
,
believes
that
it
must
take
appropriate
actions
to
provide
greater
worker
protection
against
exposures
to
toxic
substances
.
evidence
indicates
that
market
forces
have
not
been
effective
in
reducing
excessive
occupational
exposure
to
asbestos
,
thereby
contributing
to
the
development
of
diseases
related
to
it
.
in
spite
of
the
hazards
associated
with
asbestos
,
the
social
costs
of
production
have
not
been
internalized
,
in
part
because
of
market
imperfections
and
the
existence
of
externalities
.
consequently
,
the
amount
of
protection
that
the
private
market
will
offer
to
workers
differs
from
the
socially
desired
level
,
for
the
following
reasons
.
first
,
evidence
on
occupational
health
hazards
in
general
suggests
that
,
in
the
absence
of
immediate
or
clearcut
clear
cut
danger
,
employees
and
employers
have
little
incentive
to
seek
or
provide
information
on
the
potential
longterm
long
term
effects
of
exposure
.
when
relevant
information
is
provided
,
however
,
employers
and
employees
might
still
find
informed
decision
making
a
difficult
task
,
especially
where
long
latency
periods
precede
the
development
of
disease
.
moreover
,
if
signs
and
symptoms
are
nonspecificthat
is
,
if
an
illness
could
be
jobrelated
job
related
or
could
have
other
causesemployees
and
employers
may
not
link
disease
with
exposure
.
second
,
even
if
workers
were
fully
informed
of
the
health
risks
associated
with
exposure
to
asbestos
,
many
face
limited
employment
options
.
nontransferability
non
transferability
of
occupational
skills
and
high
regional
unemployment
rates
sharply
reduce
a
workers
expectation
of
obtaining
alternative
employment
quickly
or
easily
.
a
worker
employed
in
resurfacing
automobile
brakes
,
for
example
,
could
find
it
difficult
to
apply
occupational
skills
to
a
new
job
in
searching
for
a
safer
workplace
.
in
many
regions
of
the
country
,
the
practical
choice
for
workers
is
not
between
a
safe
job
and
a
better
paying
but
more
hazardous
position
,
but
simply
between
employment
and
unemployment
at
the
prevailing
rates
of
pay
and
risk
.
in
addition
to
the
fear
of
substantial
income
loss
from
prolonged
periods
of
unemployment
,
the
high
costs
of
relocation
,
the
reluctance
to
break
family
and
community
ties
,
and
the
growth
of
institutional
factors
such
as
pension
plans
and
seniority
rights
serve
to
elevate
the
cost
of
job
transfer
.
in
addition
to
the
market
imperfections
,
externalities
result
in
employers
and
employees
settling
for
an
inefficiently
low
level
of
protection
from
toxic
substances
.
for
the
competitive
market
to
function
efficiently
,
only
workers
and
their
employers
should
be
affected
by
the
level
of
safety
and
health
provided
in
market
transactions
.
in
the
case
of
occupational
safety
and
health
,
however
,
society
shares
part
of
the
financial
burden
of
occupationally
induced
diseases
,
including
the
costs
of
premature
death
,
excess
sickness
,
and
disability
.
individuals
who
suffer
from
occupationally
related
illness
are
cared
for
and
compensated
by
society
through
taxpayer
support
of
social
programs
,
including
welfare
,
social
security
,
and
medicare
.
these
combined
factors
of
labor
market
imperfections
and
the
existence
of
externalities
prevent
the
market
from
delivering
an
optimal
supply
of
healthful
working
conditions
in
industries
where
asbestos
hazards
exist
.
tort
liability
and
asbestos
litigation
greater
reliance
on
the
use
of
liability
under
tort
law
is
one
of
the
examples
of
a
nonregulatory
regulatory
alternative
identified
and
set
forth
by
the
office
of
management
and
budget
guidelines
for
implementing
executive
orders
12866
and
12291
.
prosser
[
prosser
,
1971
]
describes
a
tort
,
in
part
,
as
a
`
civil
wrong
,
other
than
a
breach
of
contract
,
for
which
the
court
will
provide
a
remedy
in
the
form
of
an
action
for
damages
'
although
he
says
that
`
a
really
satisfactory
definition
has
yet
to
be
found
'
if
the
tort
system
effectively
applied
,
it
would
allow
a
worker
whose
health
has
been
adversely
affected
by
occupational
exposure
to
asbestos
to
sue
and
recover
damages
from
the
employer
.
furthermore
,
the
tort
system
would
shift
the
liability
of
direct
costs
of
occupational
disease
from
the
worker
to
the
firm
under
certain
specific
circumstances
.
the
tort
system
has
had
limited
success
in
shifting
the
cost
of
occupational
disease
.
the
limitations
of
the
system
are
discussed
in
the
following
paragraphs
.
asbestos
product
liability
litigation
as
a
means
of
reducing
worker
exposure
to
asbestos
has
proven
effective
in
some
areas
,
but
cumbersome
to
resolve
.
the
difficulties
are
inherent
in
the
litigation
process
as
it
relates
to
asbestos
products
and
in
the
nature
of
the
diseases
associated
with
asbestos
.
with
very
limited
exceptions
,
however
,
the
tort
system
is
not
a
viable
alternative
in
dealings
between
employees
and
their
employers
.
all
states
have
legislation
providing
that
workers
'
compensation
is
either
the
exclusive
or
principal
remedy
available
to
employees
against
their
employers
.
thus
,
tort
law
can
only
be
applied
to
thirdparty
third
party
suppliers
of
a
hazardous
substance
.
it
is
often
difficult
,
however
,
to
demonstrate
cause
,
which
is
a
necessary
prerequisite
for
the
successful
application
of
tort
liability
against
these
suppliers
.
