)
to

are

,
according
to
the
section
numbers
and
headings
of
the
regulations
they
affect

section
57
4102
definitions
the
department
is
proposing
to
add
the
following
terms
to
this
section
:
`
`
geriatric
psychiatry
'
'
means
the
prevention
,
diagnosis
,
evaluation
and
treatment
of
mental
disorders
and
disturbances
seen
in
older
adults
.
this
definition
is
adapted
from
the
definition
used
by
the
american
association
of
geriatric
psychiatrists
and
is
added
to
the
section
to
incorporate
the
statutory
requirement
for
the
expansion
of
project
support
to
include
the
training
of
physicians
who
plan
to
teach
geriatric
psychiatry
.
`
`
relevant
advanced
training
or
experience
'
'
means
at
least
one
of
the
following
:
(
1
)
completion
of
at
least
a
12month
month
graduate
training
program
in
a
healthrelated
health
related
discipline
,
the
basic
sciences
,
or
education
;
or
(
2
)
a
minimum
of
2
years
of
clinical
practice
,
of
which
at
least
12
months
were
devoted
in
part
to
managing
older
dental
patients
in
a
hospital
,
longterm
long
term
care
facility
,
or
other
setting
.
this
definition
was
developed
with
consultation
from
an
ad
hoc
committee
of
geriatric
dentists
and
with
positive
internal
review
.
the
definition
is
added
to
the
section
to
incorporate
the
statutory
requirement
for
the
expansion
of
fellowship
eligibility
of
dental
fellows
in
the
program
.
section
57
4111
duration
of
fellowships
.
the
department
is
proposing
to
remove
this
section
from
the
regulations
.
the
regulatory
language
currently
reads
:
an
appointment
to
a
fellowship
may
be
made
for
a
period
not
to
exceed
12
months
.
fellowship
assistance
for
participants
in
a
1year
year
fellowship
program
and
a
1year
year
retraining
program
is
limited
to
12
months
.
participants
in
2year
year
fellowship
programs
may
receive
a
second
12month
month
appointment
for
a
total
period
of
24
months
.
public
law
102408
no
longer
provides
for
a
1year
year
fellowship
program
.
further
,
the
language
regarding
the
period
of
time
for
appointments
to
a
fellowship
is
unnecessarily
restrictive
to
individuals
who
may
benefit
from
further
fellowship
or
retraining
experience
in
a
life
time
.
for
example
,
a
faculty
fellow
who
completed
a
1year
year
retraining
to
have
the
skills
required
to
incorporate
geriatrics
into
course
content
and
clinical
rotations
may
discover
5
years
later
that
another
fellowship
experience
would
provide
the
opportunity
to
develop
research
skills
in
geriatrics
required
to
expand
the
scope
and
depth
of
practicebased
practice
based
geriatric
research
.
in
addition
to
the
changes
proposed
above
,
a
number
of
technical
,
clarifying
,
and
ministerial
changes
are
included
to
conform
the
existing
regulations
with
amendments
made

law
102408
.
