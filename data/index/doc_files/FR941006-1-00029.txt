in
the
current
processing
environment
for
state
and
local
government
series
securities
,
the
bureau
of
the
public
debt
has
authorized
selected
federal
reserve
banks
or
branches
,
acting
as
fiscal
agents
of
the
united
states
,
to
provide
services
in
connection
with
the
purchase
of

transactions
involving
,
and
redemption
of

the
securities

subscriptions
for
the
purchase
of
state
and
local
government
series
securities
are
accepted
at
designated
federal
reserve
banks
or
branches
,
subject
to
verification
by
the
bureau
of
the
public
debt

full
payment
for
each

must
be

the
current
processing
environment
requires
that
staffing
and
technical
expertise
be
maintained
at
12
designated
federal
reserve
banks
or
branches
to
provide
unique
services
in
connection

the
bureau
of
the
public
debt
,
office
of
securities
and
accounting
services
,
division
of
special
investments
(
hereafter
referred
to
as
the
division
of
special
investments
)
has
determined
that
the
volume
of
transactions
in
this
securities
program
does
not
merit
the
expense
of
maintaining
technical
expertise
at
12
different
locations
.
the
bureau
of
the
public
debt
has
decided
to
centralize
all
issuance
,
funds
collection
,
and
accounting
functions
for
the
state
and
local
government
series
securities
program
in
the
division
of
special
investments
.
the
responsibility
for
these
functions
will
be
withdrawn
from
the
designated
federal
reserve
banks
beginning
on
a
specific
issue
date
which
will
be
announced
in
the
final
rule
.
it
is
anticipated
that
this
date
will
be
01/03/1995
.
after
centralization
,
federal
reserve
bank
or
branch
involvement
in
this
program
will
be
limited
to
processing
interest
and
redemption
payments
made
through
reserve
account
credits
for
a
very
small
number
of
existing
securities
accounts
.
this
method
of
payment
is
limited
to
securities
for
which
subscriptions
were
submitted
prior
to
02/01/1987
.
more
than
98
%
of
all
interest
and
redemption
payments
for
state
and
local
government
series
securities
are
made
by
the
automated
clearing
house
method
(
ach
,
with
credit
directed
to
the
owners
account
at
a
financial
institution
.
beginning
on
the
effective
date
of
the
final
rule
,
subscriptions
for
the
purchase
of
state
and
local
government
series
securities
which
request
issuance
on
or
after
a
designated
date
will
only
be
accepted
by
the
division
of
special
investments
.
full
payment
for
each
subscription
will
be
submitted
by
the
investors
financial
institution
on
or
before
the
issue
date
utilizing
the
fedwire
funds
transfer
system
which
is
available
throughout
the
commercial
banking
industry
.
it
will
no
longer
be
necessary
for
investors
to
deposit
the
funds
in
an
account
subject
to
debit
by
a
federal
reserve
bank
or
branch
on
or
before
the
date
of
issue
.
this
proposed
rule
change
is
expected
to
provide
investors
in
state
and
local
government
series
securities
with
several
benefits
.
investors
will
enjoy
a
higher
level
of
customer
service
and
more
consistent
application
of
the
regulations
pertaining
to
this
securities
program
.
investors
will
be
dealing
directly
with
staff
in
the
division
of
special
investments
who
are
trained
and
skilled
in
the
many
unique
aspects
of
this
securities
program
and
whose
principal
responsibility
it
is
to
manage
the
state
and
local
government
series
securities
program
.
in
addition
,
united
states
taxpayers
will
benefit
in
terms
of
the
reduced
costs
of
operating
this
securities
program
which
will
be
realized
by
centralizing
operations
within
the
division
of
special
investments
.
because
the
responsibility
for
all
issuance
,
funds
collection
,
and
accounting
functions
for
the
state
and
local
government
series
securities
program
will
be
withdrawn
from
the
designated
federal
reserve
banks
and
because
the
division
of
special
investments
must
assume
these
operations
on
or
about
01/03/1995
,
the
bureau
of
the
public
debt
has
determined
that
a
comment
period
of
15
days
is
necessary
.
this
will
allow
time
for
comments
to
be
incorporated
in
a
final
rule
within
operational
time
constraints
.
although
most
of
the
changes
in
this
proposed
rule
are
ministerial
in
nature
(
for
example
,
changes
to
increase
the
use
of
facsimile
transmittals
and
to
provide
new
addresses
,
proposed
changes
concerning
amending
subscriptions
(
3443b3iv
)
and
§
3447b
)
and
concerning
waivers
and
fees
associated
with
the
failure
to
settle
subscriptions
(
3444b
)
and
§
3448b
)
merit
special
attention
.
the
department
of
the
treasury
is
also
in
the
process
of
considering
the
revision
of
the
regulations
governing
the
state
and
local
government
series
securities
program
,
with
a
view
to
increasing
the
flexibility
of
the
program
.
the
proposed
rule
does
not
include
these
types
of
changes
due
to
the
need
to
adopt
the
proposed
rule
very
quickly
.
changes
to
the
state
and
local
government
series
securities
program
could
include
changes
in
the
certification
requirements
and
in
the
rules
relating
to
the
redemption
of
slgs
securities

maturity
