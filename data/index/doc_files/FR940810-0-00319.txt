:
a
microscope

with
a

pair
to
create
phase
contrast

the

which
uses
this

phasepolar
phase
polar
analysis
:
this
is
the
use
of
polarized
light
in
a
phase
contrast
microscope
.
it
is
used
to
see
the
same
size
fibers
that
are
visible
in
air

analysis
.
although
fibers
finer
than
1
m
are
visible
,
analysis
of
these
is
inferred
from
analysis
of
larger
bundles
that
are
usually
present
.

has
an

,
a
polarizer
,
a
first

all
in

so
that
the

this
is
a
product
which
can
be
applied
,
preferably
by
spraying

onto
an
asbestos

which
will
seal

history
light
microscopy
has
been
used
for
well
over
100
years
for
the
determination
of
mineral
species
.
this
analysis
is
carried
out
using
specialized
polarizing
microscopes
as
well
as
bright
field
microscopes
.
the
identification
of
minerals
is
an
ongoing
on
going
process
with
many
new
minerals
described
each
year
.
the
first
recorded
use
of
asbestos
was
in
finland
about
2500
bc
.
where
the
material
was
used
in
the
mud
wattle
for
the
wooden
huts
the
people
lived
in
as
well
as
strengthening
for
pottery
.
adverse
health
aspects
of
the
mineral
were
noted
nearly
2000
years
ago
when
pliny
the
younger
wrote
about
the
poor
health
of
slaves
in
the
asbestos
mines
.
although
known
to
be
injurious
for
centuries
,
the
first
modern
references
to
its
toxicity
were
by
the
british
labor
inspectorate
when
it
banned
asbestos
dust
from
the
workplace
in
1898
.
asbestosis
cases
were
described
in
the
literature
after
the
turn
of
the
century
.
cancer
was
first
suspected
in
the
mid
1930s
and
a
causal
link
to
mesothelioma
was
made
in
1965
.
because
of
the
public
concern
for
worker
and
public
safety
with
the
use
of
this
material
,
several
different
types
of
analysis
were
applied
to
the
determination
of
asbestos
content
.
light
microscopy
requires
a
great
deal
of
experience
and
craft
.
attempts
were
made
to
apply
less
subjective
methods
to
the
analysis
.
xray
x
ray
diffraction
was
partially
successful
in
determining
the
mineral
types
but
was
unable
to
separate
out
the
fibrous
portions
from
the
nonfibrous
fibrous
portions
.
also
,
the
minimum
detection
limit
for
asbestos
analysis
by
xray
x
ray
diffraction
(
xrd
)
is
about
1
.
differential
thermal
analysis
(
dta
)
was
no
more
successful
.
these
provide
useful
corroborating
information
when
the
presence
of
asbestos
has
been
shown
by
microscopy
;
however
,
neither
can
determine
the
difference
between
fibrous
and
nonfibrous
fibrous
minerals
when
both
habits
are
present
.
the
same
is
true
of
infrared
absorption
(
ir
.
when
electron
microscopy
was
applied
to
asbestos
analysis
,
hundreds
of
fibers
were
discovered
present
too
small
to
be
visible
in
any
light
microscope
.
there
are
two
different
types
of
electron
microscope
used
for
asbestos
analysis
:
scanning
electron
microscope
(
sem
)
and
transmission
electron
microscope
(
tem
.
scanning
electron
microscopy
is
useful
in
identifying
minerals
.
the
sem
can
provide
two
of
the
three
pieces
of
information
required
to
identify
fibers
by
electron
microscopy
:
morphology
and
chemistry
.
the
third
is
structure
as
determined
by
selected
area
electron
diffractionsaed
which
is
performed
in
the
tem
.
although
the
resolution
of
the
sem
is
sufficient
for
very
fine
fibers
to
be
seen
,
accuracy
of
chemical
analysis
that
can
be
performed
on
the
fibers
varies
with
fiber
diameter
in
fibers
of
less
than
02
m
diameter
.
the
tem
is
a
powerful
tool
to
identify
fibers
too
small
to
be
resolved
by
light
microscopy
and
should
be
used
in
conjunction
with
this
method
when
necessary
.
the
tem
can
provide
all
three
pieces
of
information
required
for
fiber
identification
.
most
fibers
thicker
than
1
m
can
adequately
be
defined
in
the
light
microscope
.
the
light
microscope
remains
as
the
best
instrument
for
the
determination
of
mineral
type
.
this
is
because
the
minerals
under
investigation
were
first
described
analytically
with
the
light
microscope
.
it
is
inexpensive
and
gives
positive
identification
for
most
samples
analyzed
.
further
,
when
optical
techniques
are
inadequate
,
there
is
ample
indication
that
alternative
techniques
should
be
used
for
complete
identification
of
the
sample
.

principle
minerals
consist
of
atoms
that
may
be
arranged
in
random
order
or
in
a
regular
arrangement
.
amorphous
materials
have
atoms
in
random
order
while
crystalline
materials
have
long
range
order
.
many
materials
are
transparent
to
light
,
at
least
for
small
particles
or
for
thin
sections
.
the
properties
of
these
materials
can
be
investigated
by
the
effect
that
the
material
has
on
light
passing
through
it
.
the
six
asbestos
minerals
are
all
crystalline
with
particular
properties
that
have
been
identified
and
cataloged
.
these
six
minerals
are
anisotropic
.
they
have
a
regular
array
of
atoms
,
but
the
arrangement
is
not
the
same
in
all
directions
.
each
major
direction
of
the
crystal
presents
a
different
regularity
.
light
photons
travelling
in
each
of
these
main
directions
will
encounter
different
electrical
neighborhoods
,
affecting
the
path
and
time
of
travel
.
the
techniques
outlined
in
this
method
use
the
fact
that
light
traveling
through
fibers
or
crystals
in
different
directions
will
behave
differently
,
but
predictably
.
the
behavior
of
the
light
as
it
travels
through
a
crystal
can
be
measured
and
compared
with
known
or
determined
values
to
identify
the
mineral
species
.
usually
,
polarized
light
microscopy
(
plm
)
is
performed
with
strainfree
strain
free
objectives
on
a
brightfield
bright
field
microscope
platform
.
this
would
limit
the
resolution
of
the
microscope
to
about
04
&
mum
.
because
osha
requires
the
counting
and
identification
of
fibers
visible
in
phase
contrast
,
the
phase
contrast
platform
is
used
to
visualize
the
fibers
with
the
polarizing
elements
added
into
the
light
path
.
polarized
light
methods
cannot
identify
fibers
finer
than
about
1
m
in
diameter
even
though
they
are
visible
.
the
finest
fibers
are
usually
identified
by
inference
from
the
presence
of
larger
,
identifiable
fiber
bundles
.
when
fibers
are
present
,
but
not
identifiable
by
light
microscopy
,
use
either
sem
or
tem
to
determine
the
fiber
identity
.

advantages
and
disadvantages
the
advantages
of
light
microcopy
are
:
(
a
)
basic
identification
of
the
materials
was
first
performed
by
light
microscopy
and
gross
analysis
.
this
provides
a
large
base
of
published
information
against
which
to
check
analysis
and
analytical
technique
.
(
b
)
the
analysis
is
specific
to
fibers
.
the
minerals
present
can
exist
in
asbestiform
,
fibrous
,
prismatic
,
or
massive
varieties
all
at
the
same
time
.
therefore
,
bulk
methods
of
analysis
such
as
xray
x
ray
diffraction
,
ir
analysis
,
dta
,
etc
.
are
inappropriate
where
the
material
is
not
known
to
be
fibrous
.
(
c
)
the
analysis
is
quick
,
requires
little
preparation
time
,
and
can
be
performed
onsite
on
site
if
a
suitably
equipped
microscope
is
available
.
the
disadvantages
