it
could
be
argued
that
the
anticipated
benefits
from
amending
the
federal
restriction
on
animal
rabies
vaccines
to
require
that
they
be
distributed
and
used
only
by
or
under
the
direct
supervision
of
a
licensed
veterinarian
would
be
:
(

)
more
uniform
regulation
of
the
distribution
and
administration
of
animal
rabies
vaccines
,
(

)
improved
documentation
of
animal
rabies
vaccinations
to
enable
public
health
officials
to
make
an
informed
choice
concerning
the
therapy
for
animal
bite
victims
;
(

facilitation
of
the
recall
of
any
unsatisfactory
serials
of
rabies
vaccines
,
and
(

)
assurance
of
the
identification
of
animals
receiving
vaccines
determined
not
to
meet
requirements
for
stability
or
potency
.
currently
,
it
is
reported
that
984
percent
of
the
25000000
doses
of
animal
rabies
vaccine
that
are
distributed
in
the
united
states
each
year
are
sold
directly
to

it
is
not

,
however
,
how
many
of
these
doses
are
redistributed
through
catalogs
and
over
the
counter
for
administration
by
nonveterinarians
.
an

human

for
potential

in
1989
,
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
recommended
that
the
most
effective
methods
for
reducing
human
exposure
to
rabies
are
education
of
the
public
to
avoid

request
for
comments
since
receiving
the
request
from
the
nasphv
to
amend
the
federal
restrictions
on
animal
rabies
vaccines
,
aphis
has
attempted
to
identify
specific
issues
(
enumerated
below
)
that
need
to
be
addressed
before
the
agency
can
proceed
with
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
.
some
of
these
issues
raise
questions
and
identify
competing
interests
that
are
difficult
to
resolve
.
for
example
,
a
federal
restriction
that
animal
rabies
vaccines
only
be
distributed
to
veterinarians
and
administered
by
or
under
the
direct
supervision
of
a
licensed
veterinarian
could
have
the
benefit
of
ensuring
proper
administration
and
could
also
enable
public
health
officials
to
certify
that
a
rabies
vaccine
was
properly
administered
.
an
unintended
effect
of
such
a
restriction
,
however
,
could
be
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
animals
vaccinated
with
a
corresponding
reduction
in
the
effectiveness
of
rabies
prevention
by
making
it
more
expensive
or
impractical
to
vaccinate
multiple
animals
in
single
households
,
animals
in
kennels
,
farm
animals
,
or
animals
in
metropolitan
animal
sheltersanimals
which
are
often
vaccinated
by
nonveterinarians
.
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
proper
vaccine
administration
,
a
1989
study
showed
that
only
5
%
of
rabid
cats
and
14
%
of
rabid
dogs
reported
that
year
had
been
vaccinated
against
rabies
,
suggesting
that
rabies
incidence
in
dogs
and
cats
is
related
more
to
the
failure
to
vaccinate
than
the
failure
of
vaccination
.
after
considering
the
various
factors
involved
in
rabies
control
,
aphis
believes
that
any
amended
federal
restriction
that
the
agency
may
promulgate
should
encourage
the
vaccination
of
pets
while
providing
the
greatest
benefit
cost
value
.
towards
this
end
,
the
agency
seeks
input
on
alternative
approaches
to
the
control
of
animal
rabies
vaccines
.
the
experience
of
states
that
have
enacted
their
own
state
restrictions
is
sought
on
these
issues
.
public
comment
is
requested
to
assist
aphis
in
its
evaluation
of
the
benefits
and
costs
of
a
federal
restriction
providing
that
animal
rabies
vaccines
be
distributed
and
used
only
by
or
under
the
direct
supervision
of
a
licensed
veterinarian
.
in
order
to
obtain
a
better
understanding
of
the
benefits
versus
the
costs
of
such
a
federal
restriction
,
specific
comments
,
projections
,
or
data
are
requested
on
the
following
issues
:
1
.
the
rate
of
vaccine
misuse
and
failure
when
vaccine
is
administered
by
nonveterinarians
versus
veterinarians
