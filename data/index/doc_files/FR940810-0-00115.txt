general
industry
the
1986
general
industry
standard
required
respirator
use
where
engineering
and
work
practice
controls
are
being
installed
,
in
emergencies
,
and
to
reduce
exposures
to
or
below
the
pels
where
feasible
engineering
controls
and
work
practices
could
not
achieve
these
reductions
.
additionally
,
certain
operations
ie
,
cutting
in
plants
,
were
shown
to
have
greater
difficulties
in
achieving
low
exposures
without
respirator
use
.
osha
therefore
allowed
routine
respirator
use
in
those
segments
to
reach
the
pels
,
rather
than
,
as
in
other
general
industry
segments
,
only
where
the
employer
shows
that
feasible
engineering
and
work
practice
controls
cannot
achieve
compliance
with
the
pels
.
osha
now
believes
that
engineering
and
work
practices
in
the
few
remaining
production
sectors
can
achieve
lower
levels
than
predicted
in
1986
,
in
part
because
of
the
mandatory
work
practices
now
included
in
the
methods
of
compliance
section
.
therefore
,
allowing
respirator
use
at
higher
measured
exposures
for
a
few
operations
should
not
result
in
less
protection
for
those
employees
since
their
ambient
exposure
levels
are
expected
to
be
reduced
.

construction
standard
and
shipyard
employment
standard
.
the
respirator
provisions
in
the
construction
and
shipyard
employment
standards
are
changed
in
several
respects
.
first
,
in
addition
to
the
conditions
listed
in
the
1986
standards
,
where
exposures
exceed
the
pels
,
required
respirator
use
now
is
triggered
by
kinds
of
activities
even
where
the
pels
are
not
exceeded
.
these
are
:
class
i
work
,
class
ii
work
where
the
acm
is
not
removed
substantially
intact
;
all
class
ii
and
iii
work
where
the
employer
cannot
produce
a
negative
exposure
assessment
;
and
all
class
iv
work
carried
out
in
areas
where
respirators
are
required
to
be
worn
.
osha
has
based
these
decisions
on
the
demonstrated
variability
during
asbestos
work
,
and
on
the
need
to
protect
workers
who
are
disturbing
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
material
with
the
greatest
potential
for
significant
fiber
release
.
in
addition
,
monitoring
results
for
many
jobs
are
not
available
in
a
timely
fashion
.
by
requiring
routine
respirator
use
in
jobs
which
osha
finds
are
likely
to
result
in
hazardous
airborne
asbestos
levels
,
such
as
floor
tile
removal
,
where
most
tiles
are
broken
,
osha
is
providing
reasonable
supplemental
protection
to
employees
when
certainty
concerning
exposure
levels
is
not
possible
.
the
kind
of
respirators
required
for
these
`
conditions
of
use
'
are
set
out
in
paragraphs
(
hiv
)
and
(
v
.
in
one
situation
,
as
explained
below
,
class
i
removals
where
excessive
levels
are
predicted
,
`
supplied
air
respirators
operated
in
the
positive
pressure
mode
'
are
required
,
because
these
jobs
have
the
highest
exposure
potential
,
due
to
their
size
,
duration
and
the
kinds
of
material
involved
.
other
jobs
where
higher
than
usual
exposures
may
occur
include
,
where
employees
are
inexperienced
,
where
tsi
and
surfacing
acm
is
disturbed
,
and
where
other
acm
is
broken
up
during
removal
.
paragraph
(
h1
)
states
the
requirement
for
supplemental
respirator
use
for
these
activities
as
well
.
these
additional
respirator
requirements
conform
to
oshas
findings
on
this
record
,
of
the
specific
conditions
which
contribute
to
and
are
predictive
of
,
higher
exposures
.
as
discussed
more
fully
in
the
classification
section
,
the
data
submitted
to
the
record
show
that
in
almost
all
cases
of
removals
and
disturbances
of
nonhighrisk
high

,
exposure
levels
are

the
type
required
for
certain
kinds

and

bctd
has
recommended
that
osha
require
the
use
of
`
the
most
effective
respirator
that
is
feasible
under
the
circumstances
'
and
further
that
osha
require

in

which
include

does
recognize

bctd
also
contended
that
the
protection
factors
used
by
osha
to
assign
respirator
classes
are
contrary
to
record
evidence
.
the
court
found
that
oshas
judgment
about
supplied
air
respirators
was
properly
within
its
discretion
.
it
expressed
concern
that
oshas
respirator
requirements
did
appear
to
require
only
that
the
combined
effect
of

controls
and
respirators
limit

low
