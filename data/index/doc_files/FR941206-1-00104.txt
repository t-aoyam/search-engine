specific
to
this
industry
is
presented

coating
operations
no
emission
control
measures
are
known
to
have
previously
been
implemented
specifically
to
reduce
hap
emissions
from
this
industry
.
regulations
that
reduce
voc
emissions
will
limit
hap
emissions
since
almost
all
organic
hap
are
voc
.
at
shipyards
,
the
only
voc
control
measure
that
has
been
fully
demonstrated
for
outdoor
coating
operations
is
the
use
of
coatings
with
inherently
lower
emissions
.
such
coatings
have
and
are
being
developed
by
an
enlightened
industry
to
reduce
its
environmental
impact
.
the
new
products
are
used
for
compliance
with
voc
regulations
in
louisiana
and
some
california
jurisdictions
.
there
are
as
yet
no
known
cases
where
addon
add
on
pollution
control
systems
have
been
used
to
control
voc
emissions
from
outdoor
coating
operations
at
shipyards
.
the
california
and
louisiana
regulations
limit
the
allowable
quantity
of
voc
in
each
of
several
categories
of
coatings
,
as
applied
.
because
vohap
are
voc
(
with
the
exception
noted
above
,
such
regulations
also
reduce
,
or
at
a
minimum
,
put
a
ceiling
on
the
allowable
hap
content
of
these
coatings
.
the
california
regulations
(
voc
limits
)
are
more
stringent
than
those
in
louisiana
.
thus
,
the
major
sources
subject
to
those
california
rules
represent
the
`
best
controlled
sources
'
because
three
major
source
facilities
are
located
in
california
,
the
single
best
controlled
facility
and
the
median
facility
of
the
best
performing
five
sources
are
both
subject
to
the
stringent
california
regulations
.
therefore
,
the
agency
has
determined
that
the
mact
floor
for
both
new
and
existing
sources
is
identical
to
the
current
california
voc
limits
on
marine
coatings

for
