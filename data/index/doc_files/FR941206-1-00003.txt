the
method
of
deriving
poultry
products
by
the
mechanical
separation
and
removal
of
most
of
the
bone
from
the
meat
and
other
tissues
of
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
results
in
a
product
whose
physical
form
and
texture
differ
materially
from
those
of
other
boneless
poultry
products
produced
by
traditional
deboning
techniques
.
mechanically
separated
poultry
is
derived
using
a
machine
that
operates
on
the
differing
resistance
of
bone
and
tissue
to
passage
through
small
openings
,
whether
it
employs
sieves
,
screens
,
or
other
devices
.
such
machines
mechanically
separate
and
remove
most
of
the
bone
from
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
resulting
in
a
finely
comminuted
,
pastelike
paste
like
product
.
the
starting
materials
,
which
may
have
undergone
an
initial
bone
breaking
process
,
are
pushed
under
high
pressure
through
equipment
with
apertures
that
allow
a
small
amount
of
powdered
bone
to
pass
through
with
the
soft
tissue
.
this
is
different
than
boneless
poultry
derived
by
traditional
means
,
ie
,
handdeboning
hand
deboning
,
and
such
differences
have
potential
consequences
for
consumer
expectations
.
fsis
has
statutory
responsibilities
under
the
ppia
and
fmia
to
assure
that
consumers
receive
poultry
and
meat
food
products
that
are
not
adulterated
and
that
bear
labeling
that
is
not
false
or
misleading
.
despite
this
,
the
regulations
do
not
distinguish
between
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
and
poultry
products
produced
by
traditional
deboning
techniques
,

mechanically
separated
poultry
is
produced
by
essentially
the
same
technology
and
has
characteristics
(
ie
,
physical
form
and
texture
)
similar
to
those
of
the
livestock
product
,
mss
.
yet
,
the
regulatory
requirements
for
labeling
these
two
products
currently
are
inconsistent
with
one
another
.
therefore
,
the
department
is
proposing
to
amend
the
poultry
products
inspection
regulations
(

to
revise
and
supplement
the
requirements
for
the
manufacture
,
characteristics
,
and
labeling
of
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
and
the
labeling
of
products
in
which
they
are
used
as
ingredients
.
under
this
proposal
,
mechanically
separated
product
derived
from
chicken
or
turkey
would
be
labeled
as
`
mechanically
separated
chicken
'
or
`
mechanically
separated

as
the
case
may
be
.

introduction
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
,
also
referred
to
as
mechanical
deboning
,
are
characteristically
finely
comminuted
(
ie
,
finely
ground
)
in
form
and
result
from
the
mechanical
separation
and
removal
of
most
of
the
bone
from
attached
skeletal
muscle
and
other
tissue
of
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
.
the
products
are
prepared
from
various
materials
,
including
necks
,
backs
,
and
whole
carcasses
.
these
starting
materials
may
be
raw
or
cooked
,
may
contain
varying
amounts
of
muscle
and
or
skin
,
and
may
contain
kidneys
,
except
when
product
is
made
from
mature
chickens
or
mature
turkeys
.
kidneys
of
mature
chickens
or
turkeys
may
not
be
used
as
human
food

the
technology
to
mechanically
separate
and
remove
most
of
the
bone
from
attached
skeletal
muscle
and
other
tissue
of
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
began
in
the
late
1950s
or
early
1960s
.
the
agencys
initial
reaction
was
to
consider
the
resulting
product
adulterated
because
of
the
amount
of
bone
present
and
the
physical
size
of
the
bone
particles
.
by
the
mid1960s
mid
,
the
industry
had
modified
and
improved
the
equipment
used
to
produce
poultry
product
by
mechanical
separation
such
that
the
product
contained
1
percent
or
less
bone
solids
with
an
extremely
small
bone
particle
size
.
this
prompted
the
agency
to
reevaluate
its
position
.
widespread
commercial
production
of
products
containing
mechanically
separated
poultry
began
in
the
early
1970s
.
by
1975
,
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
was
being
used
as
an
ingredient
in
poultry
and
meat
food
products
such
as
franks
,
bologna
,
salami
,
and
rolls
.
today
,
poultry
products
made
with
poultry
produced
by
mechanical
separation
include
cooked
poultry
sausages
(
such
as
chicken
frankfurters
,
turkey
salami
,
and
turkey
bologna
,
poultry
patties
and
nuggets
(
such
as
chicken
patties
and
nuggets
,
and
poultry
baby
foods
.
the
level
at
which
it
is
used
has
depended
in
part
on
technological
capabilities
and
has
reached
100
percent
of
the
poultry
product
portion
of
a
number
of
cooked
poultry
sausage
products
.
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
means
is
also
used
at
up
to
49
percent
of
the
formulations
of
certain
meat
food
products
,
eg
,
beef
and
turkey
chili
,
provided
that
it
is
identified
in
the
product
name
as
`
turkey
'
or
`
chicken
'
and
used
in
meat
food
products
including
cooked
sausages
,
such
as
frankfurters
and
bologna
,
at
a
level
of
up
to
15
percent
of
the
total
ingredients
,
excluding
water
(

without
being
identified
in
the
product
name
.
