in
09/19/1992
,
the
corps
initiated
consultation
with
nmfs
concerning
a
new
gcid
permit
application
to
conduct
maintenance
dredging
and
other
activities
at
its
facility
over
a
3year
year
period
(
199395
.
on
04/22/1993
,
nmfs
concluded
consultation
and
issued
a
jeopardy
biological
opinion
and
incidental
take
statement
that
limited
dredging
in
the
upper
oxbow
,
required
maintenance
of
the
training
wall
and
pilot
cut
through
the
lower
oxbow
,
limited
the
permit
duration
to
a
period
of
1
year
,
and
required
gcid
to
pursue
a
longterm
long
term
solution
for
protecting
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
and
correcting
passage
problems
at
the
facility
.
following
issuance
of
the
corps
permit
,
gcid
conducted
maintenance
dredging
and
other
maintenance
activities
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
biological
opinion
,
and
subsequently
began
pumping
water
on
a
restricted
basis
beginning
on
08/01/1993
.
the
department
of
justice
and
gcid
signed
a
new
stipulated
agreement
in
06/19/1993
that
allowed
operations
to
continue
in
1993
.
this
new
agreement
,
in
conjunction
with
the
biological
opinion
that
was
issued
to
the
corps
,
restricted
pumping
activities
at
the
hamilton
city
facility
,
required
various
types
of
monitoring
,
and
committed
gcid
to
ensure
the
implementation
of
longterm
long
term
protective
and
conservation
measures
for
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
at
its
hamilton
city
facility
.
in
1992
,
gcid
,
the
state
of
california
,
and
the
corps
began
a
joint
federal
and
state
environmental
review
process
to
evaluate
several
longterm
long
term
alternatives
for
correcting
fish
entrainment
,
impingement
,
and
passage
problems
at
the
gcid
facility
.
the
bureau
is
now
the
lead
federal
agency
responsible
for
preparing
the
environmental
documentation
and
constructing
the
selected
longterm
long
term
protective
and
conservation
measures
due
to
the
passage
of
the
central
valley
improvement
act
.
the
environmental
review
process
has
been
delayed
,
but
is
expected
to
be
completed
by
mid1994
mid
.
nmfs
will
consult
with
the
bureau
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
constructing
and
operating
the
selected
longterm
long
term
protection
alternative
on
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
delta
export
facilities
of
the
central
valley
project
and
the
state
water
project
the
bureau
and
the
california
department
of
water
resources
operate
facilities
in
the
sacramentosan
sacramento
san
joaquin
delta
to
convey
sacramento
river
water
into
and
through
the
delta
and
to
export
water
out
of
the
delta
.
these
facilities
include
the
delta
cross
channel
operated
by
the
bureau
,
and
water
export
and
fish
protection
facilities
operated
by
the
bureau
(
tracy
pumping
plant
)
and
california
department
of
water
resources
(
byron
pumping
plant
.
the
operations
of
these
and
other
central
valley
and
state
water
facilities
,
which
are
coordinated
through
the
coordinated
operations
agreement
between
the
bureau
and
the
state
,
can
adversely
impact
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
to
address
the
potential
adverse
effects
of
gate
operations
on
juvenile
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
survival
in
1992
,
nmfs
included
a
reasonable
and
prudent
alternative
measure
in
the
02/14/1992
,
biological
opinion
for
1992
cvp
operations
requiring
the
bureau
to
close
the
delta
cross
channel
from
february
1
through
05/01/1992
.
this
action
was
expected
to
substantially
reduce
the
diversion
of
juvenile
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
into
the
delta
from
the
sacramento
river
,
especially
with
the
extremely
critical
water
supply
and
low
export
pumping
rates
that
were
anticipated
to
occur
in
1992
.
operation
of
the
federal
and
state
export
facilities
in
1992
was
not
expected
to
incidentally
take
more
than
a
small
percentage
of
the
1991
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
outmigrant
population
.
however
,
based
on
monitoring
at
these
facilities
during
february
and
03/19/1992
,
nmfs
determined
that
the
taking
of
juveniles
exceeded
the
amount
identified
in
the
incidental
take
statement
,
and
requested
consultation
be
reinitiated
.
after
further
consultation
with
the
bureau
and
the
state
was
completed
,
nmfs
amended
the
incidental
take
statement
to
restrict
the
combined
daily
water
export
rate
from
both
facilities
to
1200
cfs
during
the
remainder
of
04/19/1992
.
the
amended
take
statement
also
required
that
consultation
be
reinitiated
if
the
incidental
take
of
juveniles
exceeded
400
fish
during
this
period
or
there
was
evidence
to
indicate
that
winterrun
winter
run
outmigration
would
substantially
continue
beyond
04/30/1992
,
and
required
both
the
bureau
and
the
state
to
support
efforts
to
develop
a
more
refined
and
accurate
method
for
determining
the
level
of
taking
incidental
to
pumping
operations
at
the
water
export
facilities
.
because
the
losses
of
juvenile
fish
at
these
facilities
were
higher
than
expected
in
the
spring
of
1992
,
nmfs
and
the
cdfg
established
a
delta
salvage
and
loss
working
group
consisting
of
representatives
from
nmfs
,
fws
,
the
california
departments
of
fish
and
game
and
water
resources
,
and
the
bureau
.
the
objectives
of
this
group
were
to
(
1
)
review
and
refine
the
juvenile
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
loss
estimates
at
the
water
export
facilities
during
the
1992
outmigration
period
,
and
(
2
)
evaluate
the
loss
estimation
and
reporting
procedures
used
in
1992
and
make
recommendations
for
improving
the
procedures
for
1993
and
future
years
.
the
group
met
frequently
to
discuss
these
issues
and
issued
a
summary
report
in
09/19/1992
that
included
a
revised
estimate
of
juvenile
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
losses
in
1992
and
a
series
of
recommendations
for
loss
estimation
and
reporting
.
the
loss
estimation
and
reporting
procedures
developed
by
this
group
were
eventually
incorporated
into
the
02/12/1993
,
biological
opinion
and
incidental
take
statement
that
nmfs
issued
to
the
bureau
on
the
longterm
long
term
operations
of
the
federal
and
state
water
projects
.
