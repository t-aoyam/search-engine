as
for
the
types
of
products
that
have
been
involved
in
pediatric
iron
poisonings
,
none
of
the
37
pediatric
fatalities
was
reported
to
be
associated
with
a
multivitamin
mineral
supplement
product
.
all
of
the
products
reported
to
be
involved
in
these
fatalities
were
either
single
or
double
nutrient
products
that
were
provided
for
use
as
prenatal
supplements
.
single
or
double
nutrient
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
generally
contain
30
mg
or
more
iron
per
dosage
unit
.
as
for
the
potency
of
the
products
involved
,
all
of
the
pediatric
fatalities
were
reported
to
be
associated
with
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
at
potencies
of
40
mg
iron
or
more
per
dosage
unit
.
fda
is
not
aware
of
any
pediatric
iron
poisoning
fatalities
associated
with
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
whose
potency
was
less
than
40
mg
iron
per
dosage
unit
.
moreover
,
only
1
of
the
37
pediatric
fatalities
was
reported
to
be
associated
with
an
ironcontaining
iron
containing
product
that
contained
less
than
60
mg
iron
per
dosage
unit
.
thus
,
fda
observed
that
requiring
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
of
products
that
contain
30
mg
or
more
iron
per
dosage
unit
will
provide
about
a
twofold
two
fold
margin
of
safety
from
the
potency
of
products
that
have
usually
been
associated
with
pediatric
fatalities
.
the
information
available
to
the
agency
shows
that
products
that
contain
30
mg
or
more
iron
per
dosage
unit
are
primarily
sold
to
women
of
childbearing
age
for
prenatal
use
.
prenatal
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
may
be
obtained
as
dietary
supplements
or
prescription
drug
products
.
fda
notes
that
all
of
the
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
associated
with
the
37
pediatric
poisoning
fatalities
were
apparently
obtained
as
prenatal
drugs
or
supplements
.
fda
finds
that
prenatal
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drugs
and
supplements
present
the
greatest
potential
for
pediatric
iron
poisonings
and
fatalities
because
of
their
iron
content
,
and
because
they
are
likely
to
be
available
in
households
with
young
children
.
prenatal
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
are
likely
to
be
in
households
with
young
children
either
because
they
remain
in
the
household
after
childbirth
,
or
because
young
children
are
present
in
the
household
during
pregnancy
.
fourth
,
fda
notes
that
both
the
ag
and
ndma
citizen
petitions
recommended
30
mg
iron
per
dosage
unit
as
an
appropriate
level
to
establish
additional
safeguards
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
pediatric
iron
poisonings
.
therefore
,
fda
is
proposing
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
for
all
dietary
supplements
and
drugs
containing
30
mg
or
more
iron
per
dosage
unit
.
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
will
reduce
the
incidence
of
pediatric
poisonings
by
providing
the
additional
safeguards
necessary
to
limit
pediatric
access
to
a
potentially
fatal
amount
of
iron
.
b
.
practical
effect
.
as
discussed
above
,
cpscs
childresistant
child
resistant
packaging
regulations
require
that
any
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drug
or
dietary
supplement
packaged
in
a
container
with
250
mg
or
more
iron
must
be
packaged
in
accordance
with
their
childresistant
child
resistant
packaging
regulations
(
16
cfr
1700
14
)
and
(
a13
.
therefore
,
fda
anticipates
that
manufacturers
and
distributors
of
drugs
and
dietary
supplements
containing
30
mg
or
more
iron
per
dosage
unit
,
and
containing
250
mg
or
more
total
iron
per
package
,
under
this
proposed
action
and
cpscs
current
regulations
(
16
cfr
1700
14
)
and
(
a13
,
a
manufacturer
or
packer
will
have
the
option
of
packaging
the
product
in
childresistant
child
resistant
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
(
eg
,
childresistant
child
resistant
blisters
,
childresistant
child
resistant
pouches
,
or
of
exercising
its
right
to
an
exemption
to
cpscs
special
packaging
requirements
to
allow
access
by
elderly
or
handicapped
persons
.
however
,
under
this
proposed
rule
,
in
the
latter
case
,
the
products
will
have
to
be
packaged
in
conventional
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
and
will
be
subject
to
cpscs
requirements
for
exempt
packaged
products
(
16
cfr
17005
.
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
,
regardless
of
which
packaging
option
a
manufacturer
or
packer
uses
,
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
of
all
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drugs
and
supplements
that
contain
30
mg
or
more
per
dosage
unit
will
ensure
the
safe
use
of
such
products
by
limiting
unintended
access
to
such
products
by
young
children
.
