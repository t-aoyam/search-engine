covers
most

out

however
,
since
both
osha
and

believe
that
stating
how
each
kind
of
material
must
be
removed
in
specific
terms
will
enhance
compliance
,
paragraph
(

)
restates
the
relevant
generic
requirements
in
terms
specific
to
each
activity
.

,

wet

all

however
,
wet

encompass
a
range
of
work
practices
.
for
example
,
when
removing
material
which
is
bound
in
a
matrix
,
misting
may
be
appropriate
.
removing
acm
or
pacm
which
is
not
so
bound
,
or
where
deterioration
of
the
acm
has
occurred
,
would
require
more
aggressive
wetting
.
thus
,
in
the
paragraph
applying
to
flooring
removal
,
the
employer
must
mist

`

cutting

for

,
the
blades
of
all

osha

these
more
specific
directions
will
help
insure
that

is
done
protectively
