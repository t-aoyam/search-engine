supplementary
information

fda
has
evaluated
data
submitted
in
accordance
with
regulations
promulgated
under
section
507
of
the
federal
food
,
drug

amended

rifabutin
,
and
(

)
its
use
in

,

.
the
agency
has
concluded
that
the
data
supplied
by
the
manufacturer
concerning
these
antibiotic
drugs
are
adequate
to
establish
their
safety
and
efficacy
when
used
as
directed
in
the
labeling
and
that
the
regulations
should
be
amended
in

to
include

)
that
this
action
is
of
a
type
that
does
not
individually
or
cumulatively
have
a

neither

this
final
rule
announces
standards
that
fda
has
accepted
in
a
request
for
approval
of

.
because
this
final
rule
is
not
controversial
and
because
when
effective
it
provides
notice
of

fda
finds
that

not
