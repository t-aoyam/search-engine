supplementary
information
:
it
is
timely
for
the
agency
to
consider
major
substantive
changes
in
the
media
policy
rule
.
under
sbas
present
regulatory
policy
,
no
business
loan
may
be
made
to
an
applicant
engaged
in
the
`
creation
,
origination
,
expression
,
dissemination
,
propagation
or
distribution
of
ideas
,
values
,
thoughts
,
opinions
or
similar
intellectual
property
,
regardless
of
medium
,
form
or
content
'
(

)
(
1993
.
there
are
several
express
exceptions
to
this
prohibition
.
this
policy
was
originally
adopted
by
sba
in
1953
under
the
authority
granted
by
section
4d
)
of
the
small
business
act
(
15
usc
.
633d
)
which
authorizes
the
agency
to
`
establish
general
policies
(
particularly
with
reference
to
the
public
interest
*
*
*
*
*
,
which
shall
govern
the
granting
and
denial
of
applications
for
financial
assistance
by
the
administration
'
the
reconstruction
finance
agency
,
the
predecessor
to
sba
,
had
a
similar
media
policy
rule
.
there
were
three
basic
reasons
for
the
policy
:
first
,
the
prohibition
is
based
upon
sbas
desire
to
avoid
any
possible
accusation
that
the
government
is
attempting
to
control
editorial
freedom
by
subsidizing
media
or
communication
for
political
or
propaganda
purposes
.
second
,
the
agency
has
generally
sought
to
avoid
government
identification
through
its
business
assistance
programs
with
concerns
which
might
publish
or
produce
matters
of
a
religious
or
controversial
nature
.
third
,
sba
recognizes
that
the
constitutionally
protected
rights
of
freedom
of
speech
and
press
ought
not
to
be
compromised
either
by
the
fear
of
government
reprisal
or
by
the
expectation
of
government
financial
assistance
.
