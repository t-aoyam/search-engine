the
subcommittee
on
sba
oversight
and
minority
enterprise
acknowledged
that
sbas
statutory
duty
to
assist
small
business
`
must
be
in
balance
with
supervening
first
amendment
prohibitions
.
the
subcommittee
does
not
believe
that
the
sba
should
engage
in
activities
which
would
necessitate
its
assumption
of
a
censorship
role
.
by
censorship
we
mean
the
ability
of
sba
to
direct
a
business
as
to
what
it
can
do
or
cannot
do
,
relative
to
first
amendment
protected
activity
,
coupled
with
the
power
to
enforce
its
will
through
the
use
of
sanctions
.
the
subcommittee
believes
such
censorship
would
exist
if
sba
were
to
place
in
its
loan
agreements
a
prohibition
against
the
promulgation
of
certain
ideas
and
values
,
a
breach
of
which
would
allow
the
agency
to
liquidate
the
loan
'
many
individual
members
of
congress
have
expressed
concern
with
the
substance
of
sbas
regulations
in
this
area
.
several
bills
have
been
introduced
to
deal
with
the
rule
legislatively
,
although
none
has
been
enacted
.

2084
,
98th
cong

(

,
would
have
abolished
the
rule
except
in
cases
where
the
financial
assistance
would
have
been
used
primarily
to
(

)
advance
or
inhibit
religion
;
(
2
)
threaten
the
overthrow
of
organized
government
by
unlawful
means

or
(

)
engage
in
any
illegal
activity
or
the
dissemination
of
obscene
materials
which
may
be
unlawful
in
any
jurisdiction
in
which
the
small
concern
may
operate

2084
also
would
have
required
sba
to
look
at
the
content
of
the
publications
or
communications
in
making
its
decision
to
assist
a
particular
small
concern
.
hr

1st

(
1983
,
would
have
required
sba
to
hold
a
hearing
,
if
the
business
was
covered
by
the
media
policy
rule
,
in
order
to
ascertain
if
the
sba
financial
assistance
would
have
been
(
1
)
adverse
or
detrimental
to
a
legitimate
public
interest
,
or
(
2
)
used
primarily
to
promote
or
criticize
political
or
religious
ideas
.
this
approach
would
have
led
to
lengthy
hearings
on
applications
for
assistance
every
time
the
agency
interpreted
the
law
adversely
to
an
applicant
.
sba
testified
on
both
of
these
bills
and
supported
a
legislative
remedy
to
the
problems
associated
with
administration
of
the
rule
.
however
,
no
legislation
has
been
forthcoming
.
in
hearings
on
03/07/1984
,
before
the
house
subcommittee
on
export
opportunity
and
special
small
business
problems
,
which
was
considering
hr
.
1157
,
an
expert
in
constitutional
law
on
the
faculty
of
the
george
washington
university
law
school
testified
that
the
media
policy
rule
was
constitutional
and
was
a
justifiable
approach
in
light
of
sbas
business
and
financial
orientation
and
limited
first
amendment
expertise
.
however
,
there
have
been
concerns
raised
over
the
years
regarding
the
breadth
of
the
present
rule
.
the
regulation
presently
provides
a
very
broad
list
of
ineligible
enterprises
which
includes
publishers
,
producers
,
importers
,
exporters
or
distributors
of
all
types
of
communications
(
such
as
newspapers
,
sheet
music
,
posters
,
film
,
tape
,
theatrical
productions
,
greeting
cards
,
and
books
,
plus
transportation
concerns
limited
to
the
distribution
of
such
products
.
regulatory
exceptions
have
been
granted
to
commercial
printing
firms
,
advertising
agencies
,
technical
production
facilities
(
such
as
a
recording
studio
,
and
vocational
schools
.
eligible
for
assistance
based
on
administrative
interpretations
are
general
merchandise
stores
which
sell
books
,
magazines
and
newspapers
,
and
general
book
,
music
,
record
or
videotape
stores
.
not
eligible
for
assistance
are
specialty
book
or
videotape
stores
which
sell
or
rent
items
in
a
single
or
limited
subject
area
.
the
rationale
underlying
the
distinction
between
general
and
specialty
stores
has
been
that
a
general
store
covers
a
broad
range
of
ideas
,
values
and
thoughts
,
rather
than
a
particular
or
narrow
set
of
ideas
or
values
.
sba
no
longer
regards
this
distinction
as
a
proper
basis
for
determining
eligibility
.
sba
is
well
aware
that
small
media
concerns
often
have
difficulty
in
raising
capital
or
borrowing
money
.
the
media
policy
rule
applicable
to
the
financing
of
business
loans
has
not
been
applicable
to
assistance
provided
by
small
business
investment
companies
(
sbics
)
which
are
licensed
by
sba
.
thus
,
sbics
are
permitted
to
help
businesses
engaged
in
the
media
.
the
policy
surrounding
sbic
assistance
to
media
concerns
is
similar
to
the
approach
taken
by
the
congress
in
funding
broadcasting
through
the
nonprofit
corporation
for
public
broadcasting
.
sbics
operate
within
sba
regulations
,
but
their
transactions
with
small
companies
are
private
arrangements
which
carry
no
sba
guaranty
.
their
funding
comes
from
private
,
sba
and
other
nonprivate
sources
.
