the
classes
are
exclusive
.
for
example
,
the
stripping
of
50
linear
feet
of
thermal
system
insulation
,
which
has
not
been
positively
identified
as
nonasbestos
asbestos
containing
material
is
class
i
,
for
it
is
the
removal
of
pacm
.
repair
of
a
valve
covered
by
acm
is
class
iii
,
since
`
removal
'
is
not
taking
place
.

osha
believes
dividing
activities
by
`
classes
'
will
be
clearer
than
the
prior
system
in
the
1986
standard
which
prescribed
different
precautions
for
`
small
scale
,
short
duration
work
'
which
it
then
defined
by
example
.
as
noted
in
several
places
in
this
document
this
was
confusing
to
employers
,
to
the
court
and
to
osha
itself
.
a
more
extensive
discussion
of
the
`
class
'
system
of
designating
work
with
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
materials
is
contained
in
the
discussion
on
`
methods
of
compliance
'
provisions
later
in
this
preamble
.
class
iv
work
is
defined
as
maintenance
and
custodial
activities
during
which
employees
contact
acm
and
pacm
and
activities
to
clean
up
waste
and
debris
containing
acm
and
pacm
.
this
includes
dusting
surfaces
,
vacuuming
carpets
,
mopping
floors
,
cleaning
up
acm
or
pacm
materials
from
thermal
system
insulation
or
surfacing
acm
pacm
.
workers
may
contact
acm
or
pacm
when
performing
a
wide
variety
of
routine
jobs
that
result
in
incidental
disturbance
,
such
as
changing
a
battery
in
a
smoke
detector
attached
to
a
ceiling
containing
acm
or
pacm
,
polishing
floors
containing
asbestos
,
and
changing
a
light
bulb
in
a
fixture
attached
to
an
asbestos
containing
ceiling
.
for
custodial
work
,
the
class
iv
characterization
applies
to
situations
where
there
is
an
indication
that
surfaces
are
contaminated
with
acm
or
pacm
.
one
indication
would
be
identification
of
the
acm
or
pacm
sources
of
the
debris
or
dust
;
such
as
visibly
damaged
,
or
degraded
,
acm
or
pacm
in
the
vicinity
.
visibly
damaged
,
degraded
,
or
friable
acm
or
pacm
are
indications
that
surface
dust
could
contain
asbestos
,
and
class
iv
protection
applies
.
osha
requires
in
(
g9
)
that
such
dust
or
debris
be
assumed
to
be
acm
or
pacm
.
another
indication
could
be
an
analytical
test
to
determine
whether
the
surface
dust
itself
contains
asbestos
.
since
dust
of
carpets
may
not
be
visible
,
visible
dust
on
other
surfaces
along
with
the
presence
of
acm
pacm
nearby
would
indicate
that
cleaning
the
carpet
is
class
iv
work
.
the
general
industry
standard
also
includes
requirements
for
maintenance
and
custodial
operations
which
mirror
class
iv
requirements
in
the
construction
standard
.
these
would
apply
to
activities
which
are
not
traditionally
viewed
as
construction
activities
,
and
which
,
as
contended
by
certain
participants
in
this
proceeding
,
may
not
be
covered
by
the
construction
safety
act
(
40
usc
.
333
.
as
further
discussed
in
the
preamble
discussion
relating
to
paragraph
(
a
,
scope
and
application
,
examples
of
these
activities
are
cleanup
clean
in
areas
where
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
dust
or
debris
is
present
and
removing
light
fixtures
located
near
`
high
risk
'
surfacing
material
.
