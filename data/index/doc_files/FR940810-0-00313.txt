materials
and
equipment
necessary
for
asbestos
removal
although
individual
asbestos
removal
projects
vary
in
terms
of
the
equipment
required
to
accomplish
the
removal
of
the
materials
,
some
equipment
and
materials
are
common
to
most
asbestos
removal
operations
.
plastic
sheeting
used
to
protect
horizontal
surfaces
,
seal
hvac
openings
or
to
seal
vertical
openings
and
ceilings
should
have
a
minimum
thickness
of
6
mils
.
tape
or
other
adhesive
used
to
attach
plastic
sheeting
should
be
of
sufficient
adhesive
strength
to
support
the
weight
of
the
material
plus
all
stresses
encountered
during
the
entire
duration
of
the
project
without
becoming
detached
from
the
surface
.
other
equipment
and
materials
which
should
be
available
at
the
beginning
of
each
project
are
:
_
hepa
filtered
vacuum
is
essential
for
cleaning
the
work
area
after
the
asbestos
has
been
removed
.
it
should
have
a
long
hose
capable
of
reaching
outoftheway
out
of
the
way
places
,
such
as
areas
above
ceiling
tiles
,
behind
pipes
,
etc
.
_
portable
air
ventilation
systems
installed
to
provide
the
negative
air
pressure
and
air
removal
from
the
enclosure
must
be
equipped
with
a
hepa
filter
.
the
number
and
capacity
of
units
required
to
ventilate
an
enclosure
depend
on
the
size
of
the
area
to
be
ventilated
.
the
filters
for
these
systems
should
be
designed
in
such
a
manner
that
they
can
be
replaced
when
the
air
flow
volume
is
reduced
by
the
buildup
build
of
dust
in
the
filtration
material
.
pressure
monitoring
devices
with
alarms
and
strip
chart
recorders
attached
to
each
system
to
indicate
the
pressure
differential
and
the
loss
due
to
dust
buildup
on
the
filter
are
recommended
.
_
water
sprayers
should
be
used
to
keep
the
asbestos
material
as
saturated
as
possible
during
removal
;
the
sprayers
will
provide
a
fine
mist
that
minimizes
the
impact
of
the
spray
on
the
material
.
_
water
used
to
saturate
the
asbestos
containing
material
can
be
amended
by
adding
at
least
15
milliliters
(
1/4
ounce
)
of
wetting
agent
in
1
liter
(
1
pint
)
of
water
.
an
example
of
a
wetting
agent
is
a
50/50
mixture
of
polyoxyethylene
ether
and
polyoxyethylene
polyglycol
ester
.
