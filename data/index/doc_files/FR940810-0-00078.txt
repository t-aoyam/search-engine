the
asbestos
standard

(

)
states
that
`
all
surfaces
shall
be
maintained
as
free
as
practicable
of
accumulations
of
dusts
and
waste
containing
asbestos
'
and
subsequently
in
(

)
specifically
states
that
items
consigned
for
disposal
which
are
contaminated
shall
be
sealed
in
impermeable
bags
or
other
closed
impermeable
containers
.
in
order
to
include
materials
which
are
contaminated
and
scheduled
for
recycling
,
not
disposal
,
the
phrase
`
or
recycling
'
is
added
to
this
provision
(

,
which
now
is
as
follows
:
waste

scrap

debris
,

containers
,
equipment
and

engineering

be
implemented
at

because
of
the
health
hazards
associated
with
asbestos
exposure
,
these
actions
must
be
considered
even
when
the
worker
believes
that
the
brake
shoes
do
not
contain
asbestos
.
osha
received
several
comments
pointing
out
a
need
for
training
requirements
for
brake
and
clutch
mechanics
.
for
example
j
.
clayton
of
clayton
associates
,
inc
supported
a
training
requirement
for
brake
and
clutch
repair
workers
citing
as
examples
that
new
jersey
required
one
day
training
for
mechanics
and
that
maryland
requires
training
for
those
covered
under
its
asbestos
program
.
he
estimated
the
cost
of
training
at
$
150
and
noted
that
certified
instructors
were
required
in
both
these
states
(
ex
.
7127
.
osha
agrees
that
workers
exposed
to
asbestos
must
be
trained
in
appropriate
ways
to
avoid
exposure
to
airborne
asbestos
fibers
.
therefore
,
osha
has
provided
a
mandatory
appendix
outlining
the
work
practices
to
be
used
in
performing
these
operations
,
and
has
included
a
requirement
that
brake
and
clutch
repair
workers
receive
training
in
the
appropriate
use
of
these
work
practices

(

)
general
industry
standard
.
the
1986
standard
contained
no
provisions
specifically
covering
work
practices
on
asbestos
containing
flooring
materials
.
in
1990
,
osha
proposed
in
paragraph
(
fxi
)
several
limitations
on
buffing
and
sanding
asbestos
containing
flooring
.
in
the
housekeeping
section
of
the
final
osha
is
prohibiting
or
limiting
three
work
practices
relating
to
floor
maintenance
for
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
flooring
materials
and
those
assumed
to
contain
asbestos
.
they
are
:
(
i
)
sanding
of
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
floor
material
is
prohibited
;
(
ii
)
stripping
of
finishes
shall
be
conducted
using
low
abrasion
pads
at
speed
lower
than
300
rpm
and
wet
methods
;
and
,
(
iii
)
burnishing
or
dry
buffing
may
be
performed
only
on

asbestos
containing
flooring
which
has
sufficient
finish
so
that
the
pad
cannot
contact
the
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
material
.
osha
had
proposed
to
allow
asbestos
containing
floor
tile
to
be
buffed
only
with
`
low
abrasion
pads
at
speeds
of
190
rpm
or
less
'
(
see

fr
at

.
however
,
after
a
review
of
the
record
osha
believes
that
restricting
sanding
of
floor
materials
,
limiting
the
speed
and
abrasiveness
of
the
pads
and
specifying
use
of
wet
methods
for
stripping
floors
,
and
allowing
buffing
only
on
finished
floors
will
protect
floor
care
workers
from
exposure
to
airborne
asbestos
fibers
while
performing
the
maintenance
and
will
minimize
future
exposures
due
to
deteriorating
flooring
caused
by
inadequate
maintenance

osha

a
