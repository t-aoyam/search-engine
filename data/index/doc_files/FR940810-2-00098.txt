identification
badges
,
coupled
with

are
issued

on
the
occasion
of
each
entry
to
and
exit
from
the
protected
areas
of
the
surry
and
north
anna
sites
.
station
security
personnel
are
required
to
maintain
control
of
the
badges
while
the
individuals
are
offsite
.
this
practice
has
been
in
effect
at
the
surry
and
north
anna
power
stations
since
each
operating
license
was
issued
.
security
personnel
retain
each
identification
badge
,
as
well
as
the
associated
access
control
card
,
when
not
in
use
by
the
authorized
individual
,
within
appropriately
designed
storage
receptacles
inside
a
bulletresistant
bullet
resistant
enclosure
.
an
individual
who
meets
the
access
authorization
requirements
is
issued
an
individual
picture
identification
card
and
an
individual
access
control
card
which
allows
entry
into
preauthorized
areas
of
the
station
.
while
entering
the
plant
in
the
present
configuration
,
an
authorized
individual
is
`
screened
'
by
the
required
detection
equipment
and
by
the
issuing
security
officer
.
having
received
the
badge
,
the
individual
proceeds
to
the
access
portal
,
inserts
the
access
control
card
into
the
card
readers
,
enters
a
personal
identification
number
(
pin
,
and
passes
through
the
turnstile
which
unlocks
if
the
preset
criteria
are
met
.
once
inside
the
station
,
the
individuals
pin
is
not
required
in
order
to
further
utilize
the
access
authorization
card
.
this
present
procedure
is
labor
intensive
since
security
personnel
are
required
to
verify
badge
issuance
,
ensure
badge
retrieval
,
and
maintain
the
badges
in
orderly
storage
until
the
next
entry
into
the
protected
area
.
the
regulations
permit
employees
to
remove
their
badges
from
the
site
,
but
an
exemption
from
10
cfr
73
55
)
is
required
to
permit
contractors
to
take
their
badges
offsite
instead
of
returning
them
when
exiting
the
site
.
environmental
impacts
of
the
proposed
action
the
commission
has
completed
its
evaluation
of
the
licensees
application
.
under
the
proposed
system
,
all
individuals
authorized
to
gain
unescorted
access
will
have
the
physical
characteristics
of
their
hand
(
hand
geometry
)
recorded
with
their
badge
number
.
since
the
hand
geometry
is
unique
to
each
individual
and
its
application
in
the
entry
screening
function
would
preclude
unauthorized
use
of
a
badge
,
the
requested
exemption
would
allow
employees
and
contractors
to
keep
their
badges
at
the
time
of
exiting
the
protected
area
.
the
process
of
verifying
badge
issuance
,
ensuring
badge
retrieval
,
and
maintaining
badges
could
be
eliminated
while
the
balance
of
the
access
procedure
would
remain
intact
.
firearm
,
explosive
,
and
metal
detection
equipment
and
provisions
for
conducting
searches
will
remain
as
well
.
the
security
officer
responsible
for
the
last
access
control
function
(
controlling
admission
to
the
protected
area
)
will
also
remain
isolated
within
a
bulletresistant
bullet
resistant
structure
in
order
to
assure
his
or
her
ability
to
respond
or
to
summon
assistance
.
