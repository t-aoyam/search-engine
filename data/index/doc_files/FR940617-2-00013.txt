scope
of
investigation
the
merchandise
covered
by
this
investigation
is
silicomanganese
.
silicomanganese
,
which
is
sometimes
called
ferrosilicon
manganese
,
is
a
ferroalloy
composed
principally
of
manganese
,
silicon
,
and
iron
,
and
normally
containing
much
smaller
proportions
of
minor
elements
,
such
as
carbon
,
phosphorous
and
sulfur
.
silicomanganese
generally
contains
by
weight
not
less
than
4
%
iron
,
more
than
30
%
manganese
,
more
than
8
%
silicon
and
not
more
than
3
%
phosphorous
.
all
compositions
,
forms
and
sizes
of
silicomanganese
are
included
within
the
scope
of
these
investigations
,
including
silicomanganese
slag
,
fines
and
briquettes
.
silicomanganese
is
used
primarily
in
steel
production
as
a
source
of
both
silicon
and
manganese
.
these
investigations
cover
all
silicomanganese
,
regardless
of
its
tariff
classification
.
most
silicomanganese
is
currently
classifiable
under
subheading
720230
0000
of
the
harmonized
tariff
schedule
of
the
united
states
(
hts
.
some
silicomanganese
may
also
be
classifiable
under
hts
subheading
720299
5040
.
although
the
hts
subheading
is
provided
for
convenience
and
customs
purposes

of
the
scope
