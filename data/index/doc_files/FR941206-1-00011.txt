although
the
data
reviewed
in
the
1979
health
and
safety
report
indicate
that
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
generally
are
acceptable
from
a
microbiological
standpoint
,
the
data
also
show
that
where
bacterial
loads
tend
to
be
higher
,
it
can
be
attributed
to
the
starting
material
used
.
this
is
not
unique
to
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
;
it
can
be
applied
to
other
finely
comminuted
and
comminuted
products
as
well
.
common
starting
materials
for
mechanical
separated
and
other
comminuted
products
are
products
that
remain
after
the
removal
of
a
substantial
portion
of
skeletal
muscle
or
other
tissue
(
eg
,
skin
)
from
poultry
carcasses
or
parts
of
carcasses
.
as
a
result
,
the
resistance
of
the
exposed
surface
area
to
microbial
penetration
has
been
reduced
and
the
ratio
of
the
surface
area
to
the
volume
of
total
product
which
is
exposed
to
contaminating
influences
has
been
increased
.
higher
microbial
counts
have
been
associated
with
the
conditions
of
holding
such
starting
materials
.
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
are
not
unique
;
all
finely
comminuted
and
comminuted
products
present
opportunities
for
excessive
microbiological
growth
because
they
consist
of
small
particles
which
have
a
greater
surface
area
than
most
poultry
products
and
because
during
its
preparation
any
microorganisms
that
are
present
are
distributed
throughout
the
product
.
therefore
,
fsis
agrees
with
the
commenters
that
there
is
a
general
need
to
address
the
issue
of
handling
requirements
for
all
poultry
products
,
including
finely
comminuted
and
comminuted
products
.
fsis
is
currently
developing
a
separate
rulemaking
that
will
deal
with
this
issue
more
fully
and
that
will
include
handling
requirements
for
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
,
and
the
materials
from
which
they
are
manufactured
.
therefore
,
fsis
will
not
propose
handling
requirements
for
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
in
this
rulemaking
.
fsis
believes
that
the
promulgation
of
handling
requirements
for
all
comminuted
poultry
,
including
mechanically
separated
poultry
products
,
and
the
starting
materials
from
which
they
are
made
,
would
eliminate
the
need
to
require
that
the
temperature
of
rooms
or
compartments
in
which
equipment
for
mechanical
deboning
of
raw
poultry
is
operated
be
maintained
at

twentyfive
twenty
five
commenters
addressed
the
issue
of
protein
quality
for
boneless
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
.
of
the
25
comments
,
24
disagreed
with
the
need
to
have
a
protein
quality
requirement
for
any
mechanically
separated
poultry
product
with
up
to
1
percent
bone

.
the
commenters
stated
the
following
reasons
for
their
disagreement
:
(

)
the
typical
us
.
diet
provides
for
an
adequate
intake
of
sufficiently
high
quality
protein
,
therefore
,
protein
quality
is
not
a
public
health
concern
in
the
us
;
(

)
the
us
.
is
not
a
proteindeficient
protein
deficient
society
which
requires
every
protein
source
to
be
the
highest
`
quality
;
a
typical
diet
consists
of
proteins
from
a
variety
of
sources
and
of
varying
quality
;
(

)
the
nutrition
labeling
education
act
(
nlea
)
of
1990
indicated
that
a
daily
value
requirement
for
protein
quality
is
not
necessary
;
(

)
over
a
20plus
plus
year
history
of
producing
mechanically
separated
poultry
,
there
has
never
been
a
problem
identified
with
the
protein
quality
of
products
manufactured
from
this
low
cost
ingredient
;
(

)
processors
have
no
control
over
the
amino
acid
content
of
the
chicken
parts
used
to
manufacture
mechanically
separated
poultryit
is
determined
by
genetics
and
not
processing
equipment
;
and
(

)
the
protein
quality
testing
requirements
suggested
in
the
anpr
for
mechanically
separated
poultry
are
expensive
,
burdensome
,
and
unnecessary
.
