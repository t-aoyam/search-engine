proposing
to
deny
its
applications
,
executed
on
02/19/1991
,
for
registration
as
a
teaching
institution
and
as
a
researcher
.
the
statutory
basis
for
the
order
to
show
cause
was
that
the
applicant
did
not
have
authorization
to
conduct
research
with
,
or
otherwise
handle
,
controlled
substances
under
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
it
intended
to
operate
,
and
that
its
registration
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
public
interest
under
21
usc
.
823f
.
the
order
to
show
cause
was
served
on
the
applicant
on
10/14/1993
.
more
than
thirty
days
have
passed
since
the
order
to
show
cause
was
received
by
the
applicant
and
the
drug
enforcement
administration
has
received
no
response
from
the
applicant
or
anyone
purporting
to
represent
it
.
pursuant
to
21
cfr
1301
54
,
the
acting
administrator
finds
that
the
applicant
has
waived
its
opportunity
for
a
hearing
.
the
acting
administrator
has
carefully
considered
the
investigative
file
in
this
matter
,
and
enters
his
final
order
under
the
provisions
of
21
cfr

54
)
and
1301
57
,
based
on
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
as
hereinafter
set
forth
.
the
acting
administrator
finds
that
the
applicant
applied
for
registration
as
a
researcher
and
as
a
teaching
institution
to
handle
controlled
substances
in
schedules
i
through
v
apparently
to
engage
in
providing
training
to
law
enforcement
personnel
in
several
areas
,
including
those
the
applicant
identified
as
drug
identification
,
drug
abuse
,
and
psychopharmacology
.
neither
the
applicant
nor
its
principal
holds
any
california
state
controlled
substance
registration
as
a
practitioner
,
or
in
any
other
capacity
.
the
applicant
has
not
offered
any
evidence
contrary
to
that
stated
in
the
order
to
show
cause
,
nor
has
it
provided
any
information
that
it
is
otherwise
qualified
as
a
teaching
institution
or
researcher
under
21
usc
.
80221
.
the
acting
administrator
also
finds
that
although
the
applicant
proposes
to
handle
such
highly
abusable
controlled
substances
such
as
heroin
,
marijuana
,
lsd
,
methamphetamine
and
methaqualone
,
it
did
not
outline
their
proposed
use
in
its
instructional
activities
,
nor
did
it
indicate
that
appropriate
security
safeguards
are
in
place
to
ensure
against
diversion
.
the
applicant
also
proposed
to
have
an
instructor
staff
of
approximately
fifty
people
who
would
transport
the
controlled
substances
,
on
their
person
,
to
various
training
sites
throughout
the
state
.
furthermore
,
the
applicants
proposed
`
teaching
institution
'
has
had
no
permanent
site
from
which
dea
can
judge
the
adequacy
of
its
security
provisions
.
the
administrator
may
deny
an
application
for
registration
if
he
determines
that
such
registration
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
public
interest
.
pursuant
to
21
usc
.
823f
,
`
in
determining
the
public
interest
,
the
following
factors
will
be
considered
:
(
1
)
the
recommendation
of
the
appropriate
state
licensing
board
or
disciplinary
authority
.
(
2
)
the
applicants
experience
in
dispensing
,
or
conducting
research
with
respect
to
controlled
substances
.
(

)
the
applicants
conviction
record
under
federal

(

)
compliance
with
applicable
state
,
federal
,
or
local
laws
relating
to
controlled
substances
.
(
5
)
such
other
conduct
which
may
threaten
the
public
health
and
safety
'
it
is
well
established
that
these
factors
are
to
be
considered
in
the
disjunctive
,
ie
,
the
administrator
may
properly
rely
on
any
one
or
a
combination
of
factors
,
and
give

(

the
acting
administrator
finds
that
the
applicant
has
failed
to
provide
any
information
to
indicate
that
the
institution
would
be
engaged
in
bona
fide
research
;
any
recommendations
from
its
state
licensing
boards
;
any
supporting
evidence
that
it
has
had
experience
in
dispensing
controlled
substances
or
conducting
research
;
any
evidence
that
it
or
its
facility
is
able
to
comply
with
all
laws
relating
to
controlled
substances
;
and
any
research
protocol
or
statement
describing
its
proposed
research
activities
.
furthermore
,
the
acting
administrator
has
no
statutory
authority
to
register
practitioners
if
they
are
not
licensed
in
the
state
in
which
they
practice

thus
,
the
administrator
must
deny
an
application
for
a
dea
certificate
of
registration
if
he
determines
that
the
applicant
is
not
authorized
to
dispense
,
or
conduct
research
with
respect
to
,
controlled
substances
under
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
he
operates

based
on
all
of
the
foregoing
,
the
acting
administrator
concludes
that
the
applications
of
academy
of

are
inconsistent
with
the
public
interest
and
must
be
denied
.
accordingly
