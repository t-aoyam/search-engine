carbon
dioxide
measurement
protocol
(
nonmandatory
)
carbon
dioxide
(
co
)
)
sampling
is
one
of
the
measurement
tools
used
to
characterize
indoor
air
quality
.
indoor
co
air
concentrations
are
indicator
measures
for
effectiveness
of
building
ventilation
.
elevated
carbon
dioxide
levels
can
be
an
indicator
of
inadequate
outside
air
exchange
rates
.
carbon
dioxide
concentrations
below
800
ppm
generally
indicate
that
the
ventilation
is
adequate
for
diluting
occupantgenerated
occupant
generated
contaminants
.
the
carbon
dioxide
concentration
and
the
associated
outside
air
ventilation
rate
offers
no
confidence
as
to
the
adequacy
of
dilution
and
removal
of
other
contaminants
released
in
the
space
.
there
is
also
no
implication
of
health
effects
associated
with
this
level
of
carbon
dioxide
,
or
any
implication
of
a
permissible
exposure
limit
.
health
effects
have
been
observed
in
buildings
where
the
carbon
dioxide
levels
were
below
800
ppm
.
osha
recommends
this
procedure
:
(
1
)
design
a
program
of
air
sampling
that
includes
samples
taken
:
(
a
)
at
least
every
three
months
to
detect
the
effects
of
seasonal
changes
(
summer
winter
transition
seasons
;
(
b
)
after
adjustments
have
been
made
to
the
hvac
system
;
and
(
c
)
at
any
time
there
is
reason
to
believe
air
quality
has
deteriorated
.
at
least
once
a
year
carbon
dioxide
levels
should
be
monitored
when
the
hvac
system
is
providing
minimum
outside
air
ventilation
.
(
2
)
measure
carbon
dioxide
concentrations
late
in
the
morning
(
about
1100
am
)
and
late
in
the
afternoon
before
workers
leave
for
home
(
about
330
pm
.
these
are
the
times
when
carbon
dioxide
levels
should
be
closest
to
equilibrium
levels
and
should
give
the
best
indication
of
effective
air
exchange
rates
.
these
normal
use
patterns
may
be
altered
by
visitor
frequency
and
should
be
accounted
for
in
the
monitoring
scheme
.
(
3
)
conduct
the
sampling
at
a
height
of
between
3
and
5
feet
above
the
floor
,
or
about
the
height
of
employees
'
heads
.
make
sure
the
samples
are
taken
at
least
2
feet
from
where
people
are
breathing
.
take
the
samples
at
a
sufficient
distance
from
any
other
sources
of
carbon
dioxide
so
these
sources
do
not
affect
the
measurements
.
(
4
)
select
sampling
locations
in
normallyoccupied
normally
occupied
areas
where
the
ventilation
mixing
would
be
the
least
effective
.
these
areas
might
include
corners
of
a
room
farthest
from
supply
ducts
and
exhaust
vents
,
locations
surrounded
by
barriers
that
might
affect
air
movement
,
or
rooms
at
the
far
end
of
a
ventilation
supply
duct
.
(
5
)
measure
the
carbon
dioxide
levels
outside
the
building
for
comparison
with
the
indoor
levels
.
average
outdoor
carbon
dioxide
levels
are
typically
300
to
500
ppm
.
(
6
)
use
colormetric
detector
tubes
or
other
directreading
direct
reading
instruments
calibrated
and
operated
according
to
the
manufacturers
instructions
for
measuring
carbon
dioxide
concentrations
.
take
sampling
and
analytical
error
into
account
before
comparing
results
with
the
800
ppm
benchmark
.
all
measuring
devices
have
a
degree
of
uncertainty
associated
with
the
results
.
an
estimate
of
that
uncertainty
is
called
the
sampling
and
analytical
error
.
the
uncertainty
can
be
reduced
by
taking
more
samples
with
the
same
device
.
table
a1
can
be
used
to
assure
95
percent
confidence
that
the
average
of
the
results
from
a
set
of
detector
tube
samples
is
less
than
800
ppm
.
osha
recommends
these
following
steps
:
(
1
)
calculate
the
average
of
the
measurements
.
(
a
)
add
the
detector
tube
results
together
.
(
b
)
divide
that
total
by
the
number
of
samples
.
(
2
)
compare
the
average
of
the
results
with
the
number
of
samples
taken
in
the
second
column
in
the
table
.
if
the
average
is
less
than
the
number
in
the
table
,
there
is
confidence
that
the
co
levels
are
less
than
800
ppm
.
example
:
three
samples
are
taken
and
the
results
are
650
ppm
,
710
ppm
,
and
680
ppm
.
the
average
of
these
three
samples
is
680
ppm
(
2040
ppm
divided
by
3
.
the
results
indicate
confidence
that
the
carbon
dioxide
levels
are
less
than
800
ppm
since
the
680
ppm
average
of
the
three
samples
is
less
than
695
ppm
