contained

however
,
an
affirmative
determination
and
annotation
of
that
affirmative

must
be
made
for
each
and

since
a

standing
assurance
that

not
acceptable

the
nasd
believes
that
requiring
such
annotations
will
enhance
member
compliance
with
affirmative
determination
requirements
already
imposed
by
the
interpretation
and
will
enable
the
nasd
to
examine
member
compliance
with
the
requirements
more
effectively
.
requiring
firms
to
annotate
each
and
every
affirmative
determination
also
will
make
clear
the
nasds
longstanding
policy
that
firms
cannot
rely
on
daily
facsimile
sheets
of
`
borrowable
stocks
'
to
satisfy
their
affirmative
determination
requirements
under
the
interpretation
.
the
annotation
requirement
will
preclude
this
practice
as
members
or
their
associated
persons
will
have
to
annotate
the
name
of
the
person
contacted
and
number
of
shares
for
each
short
sale
.
requiring
annotation
of
affirmative
determinations
will
also
enhance
the
nasds
ability
to
examine
for
compliance
with
various
other
nasd
short
sale
rules
including
those
found
in
article
iii
,
section
21
of
the
rules
of
fair
practice
(
record
keeping
)
and
in
the
uniform
practice
code
,
section
71
(
mandatory
delivery
requirements
for
certain
restricted
securities
.
further
,
the
annotation
requirement
will
assist
in
examining
for
compliance
with

short

recently
approved

accordingly
,
the
nasd
is
proposing
to
amend
the
interpretation
to
require
that
members
or
their
associated
persons
maintain
a
written
record
evidencing
their
compliance
with
the
affirmative
determination
requirement
for
each
customer
