fda
is

311
of
the
public
health

and

and
(
a4
,
and
the
statutory
provisions
cited
therein
,
for
providing
assistance
to
state
and
local
governmental
jurisdictions
with
respect
to
the
prevention
of
communicable
disease
and
the
enforcement
of
their
public
health
regulations
.
for
many
years
,
fda
has
used
model
food
codes
as
one
means
of
assisting
the
several
thousand
federal
,
state
,
and
local
agencies
that
have
primary
responsibility
for
regulating
retaillevel
retail
level
food
establishments
such
as
restaurants
,
institutions
,
grocery
stores
,
and
food
vending
locations
.
the
model
codes
that
fda
has
prepared
are
not
federal
laws
or
regulations
and
are
not
preemptive
but
are
widely
referenced
,
adopted
,
and
applied
at
all
levels
of
government
.
fda
periodically
updates
and
reissues
the
model
codes
.
fda
has
determined
that
a
new
model
food
code
revision
is
necessary
for
the
retail
segment
of
the
food
industry
because
new
technologies
are
being
applied
by
the
industry
;
new
information
about
the
nature
,
contributing
factors
,
and
means
of
preventing
foodborne
illness
have
become
available
;
and
new
approaches
to
inspection
have
been
developed
since
fda
last
revised
its
three
existing
model
codes
on
retail
food
.
fda
has
also
concluded
that
there
was
a
need
to
combine
the
provisions
of
these
codes
into
a
single
document
because
the
traditional
lines
of
demarcation
between
the
types
of
food
operations
covered
by
each
of
the
separate
codes
,
as
well
as
between
food
service
firms
versus
food
stores
,
have
largely
disappeared
.
pursuant
to
this
determination
,
fda
issued
a
notice
in
the
federal
register
of
04/13/1987
(
52
fr
11885
,
that
announced
the
agencys
plan
to
revise
the
retail
food
codes
.
in
that
notice
,
fda
cited
the
problems
that
states
were
having
with
the
model
codes
and
the
opportunities
offered
by
a
new
unified
code
.
in
the
federal
register
of
05/09/1988
(
53
fr
16472
,
fda
announced
the
availability
for
comment
of
a
draft
model
food
protection
unicode
that
would
update
and
combine
the
food
protection
and
sanitation
provisions
contained
in
the
separate
model
codes
covering
food
service
,
food
vending
,
and
retail
food
stores
.
interested
persons
were
given

fda
subsequently
extended
the
comment
period
until

in
response
to
requests
from
three
trade
associations
,
one
state
agency
,
and
the
conference
.
fda
received
over
150
letters
,
each
containing
1
or
more
comments
,
in
response
to
the
draft
model
food
protection
unicode
.
fda
considered
each
of
the
comments
and
modified
the
document
as
appropriate
based
on
the
information
that
it
received
.
among
the
comments
that
fda
considered
were
those
of
the
conference
,
which
were
