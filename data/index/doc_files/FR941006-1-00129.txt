in
that
case
,
the
plaintiff
asserted
that
the
fatal
consequences
arising
from
the
use
of
dry
,
whole
protein
products
while
dieting
were
not
the
result
of
the
customary
or
usual
use
of
these
products
,
but
rather
,
the
result
of
unusual
misuse
of
such
products
.
based
on
fdas
showing
that
the
consumption
of
dry
protein
products
could
occur
in
the
course
of
a
diet
,
and
that
,
under
certain
circumstances
in
dieting
,
serious
adverse
effects
could
arise
from
such
use
of
these
products
,
the
court
found
that
fda
properly
invoked
sections
201n
,
403a1
,
and
701a
)
of
the
act
to
impose
a
requirement
that
manufacturers
warn
consumers
of
the
consequences
that
could
result
from
the
use
of
such
products
.
the
facts
presented
by
the
evidence
on
iron
poisonings
parallel
those
that
led
the
agency
to
require
a
warning
on
protein
products
.
the
use
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
in
households
where
children
are
present
is
in
no
way
an
unusual
practice
.
multivitamin/mineral
multi
vitamin/mineral
supplements
with
iron
are
routinely
taken
by
children
,
and
products
of
this
type
specifically
intended
for
use
by
children
are
widely
available
and
commonly
sold
.
iron
supplements
and
adult
vitamin
mineral
supplements
with
iron
are
frequently
taken
by
pregnant
women
(
often
with
a
prescription
)
and
other
women
of
childbearing
child
bearing
age
because
they
require
more
iron
than
other
adults
(
see
discussion
in
section
ia
.
of
this
document
.
yet
,
the
evidence
on
poisonings
and
deaths
shows
that
the
use
of
any
type
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
product
in
such
households
can
readily
lead
to
accidental
injury
or
death
if
children
gain
access
to
the
products
,
even
though
the
products
are
not
intended
to
be
used
by
children
or
to
be
taken
in
the
numbers
in
which
ironcontaining
iron
containing
tablets
or
capsules
are
consumed
when
poisonings
occur
.
thus
,
council
