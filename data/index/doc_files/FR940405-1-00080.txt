the
most
common
internal
measure
of
co
exposure
is
blood
carboxyhemoglobin
(
hbco
.
blood
hbco
provides
a
useful
measure
of
exposure
to
co
,
and
can
be
related
to
the
cardiovascular
effects
of
co

a
way
to
determine
the
occupational
component
of

to

workplace
co
levels
and
predict
blood
hbco
with
a

.
a
difficulty
associated
with
the
use
of
co
or
hbco
as
a
biomarker
for
ets
effects
is
the
presence
of
other
sources
of

nicotine
can
be
measured
directly
in
body
fluids
and
the

can
be
related
to

such
as

alternatively
,
measurements
of
nicotine
in
air
or
cotinine
in
body
fluids
can
be
measured
,
and
the
circulating

of

can
be
inferred
using

pharmacokinetic
model
.
the
use
of
a
pharmacokinetic
model
to
relate
inhaled

to

and

levels
is
the
main
focus
of
this
section
.
pahs
are
inhaled
in
the
form
of
particulates
on
which
they
are
adsorbed
.
developing
an
appropriate
biomarker
for
etsassociated
ets
associated
pahs
is
complicated
by
the
presence
of
pahs
on
particulates
not
associated
with
ets
,
and
by
the
low
,
and
variable
,
composition
of
pahs
adsorbed
to
particulate
matter
.
one
candidate
material
which
has
been
suggested
as
an
environmental
marker
for
etsassociated
ets
associated
particulates
is
solanesol
,
a
nonvolatile
volatile
tobacco
constituent
.
however
,
the
pharmacokinetic
information
necessary
for
use
of
solanesol
as
an
internal
biomarker
is
not
currently
available
.
the
use
of
these
three
different
biomarkers
(
co
,
pahs
,
and
solanesol
)
does
not
appear
to
be
practical
.
it
appears
that
the
most
effective
strategy
currently
achievable
would
be
to
rely
on
nicotine
(
or
cotinine
)
measurement
as
a
specific
marker
of
ets
exposure
as
well
as
a
direct
measure
of
nicotine
exposure
.

.
carcinogenicity
the
mechanism
of
carcinogenicity
from
exposure
to
ets
is
not
known
,
but
it
has
been
established
that
ets
includes
a
number
of
chemicals
which
have
been
identified
as
carcinogens
(
see
tables
ii2
,
iii6
iii
,
and
iii7
iii
,
although
most
of
the
identified
carcinogenic
components
of
ets
are
not
unique
to
ets
.
therefore
,
direct
measurement
of
the
carcinogenic
components
or
related
biomarkers
in
biological
fluids
would
not
provide
a
unique
measure
of
exposure
from
ets
.
the
potentially
carcinogenic
components
of
ets
include
highly
volatile
chemicals
such
as
formaldehyde
and
benzene
,
lower
volatility
chemicals
such
as
the
nitrosamines
,
and
nonvolatile
volatile
chemicals
such
as
pahs
and
metal
compounds
,
which
are
bound
to
particulates
.
given
the
current
lack
of
information
on
the
mechanism
of
carcinogenicity
of
ets
it
is
impossible
to
identify
which
components
of
ets
should
be
targeted
for
exposure
estimation
.
the
most
prudent
choice
for
a
biomarker
in
this
case
would
be
one
which
provides
the
most
general
representation
of
all
the
components
of
ets
,
and
which
is
itself
unique
to
ets
.
in
an
experimental
study
of
potential
etsunique
ets
unique
environmental
markers
of
exposure
,
only
nicotine
was
found
to
represent
both
the
gas
phase
and
particulate
phase
organic
constituent
of
ets
[
ex
.
497
.
several
studies
have
shown
a
strong
correlation
between
measurements
of
nicotine
in
the
air
and
the
mutagenicity
of
ets
[
exs
.
4198
,
4215
.
in
these
studies
,
the
relationship
of
nicotine
to
mutagenicity
was
as
good
as
or
better
than
the
relationship
of
rsp
to
mutagenicity
(
rsp
is
assumed
to
be
the
major
contributor
of
the
carcinogenic
effects
of
ets
.
therefore
,
since
measurements
of
nicotine
in
the
air
correlate
better
than
measurements
of
rsp
to
mutagenicity
of
ets
,
and
there
is
a
positive
correlation
between
shortterm
short
term
mutagenicity
tests
and
carcinogenicity
,
the
use
of
nicotine
as
an
exposure
marker
for
the
carcinogenic
effects
of
ets
appears
to
be
justified
.

evaluation
of
cotinine
as
a
biomarker
for
ets
the
purpose
of
this
section
is
to
discuss
the
use
of
cotinine
,
a
metabolite
of
nicotine
,
as
an
internal
biomarker
for
inhalation
exposure
to
nicotine
,
and
,
as
such
,
its
usefulness
as
a
metric
for
the
health
effects
of
ets
.
cotinine
is
preferred
over
nicotine
as
an
internal
biomarker
because
of
its
slower
clearance
from
the
body
[
ex
.
471
.
there
is
a
strong
correlation
between
nicotine
intake
and
plasma
cotinine
levels
[
ex
.
4115
.
there
is
also
a
strong
correlation
between
cotinine
measured
in
body
fluids
and
ets
exposure
.
in
a
controlled
study
,
urinary
cotinine
was
found
to
be
a
reliable
marker
for
longterm
long
term
ets
exposure
,
and
plasma
and
salivary
cotinine
were
found
to
be
good
indicators
of
short
-
as
well
as
longterm
long
term
exposure
[
ex
.
473
.
several
studies
have
also
demonstrated
a
positive
relationship
between
selfreported
self
reported
exposure
to
ets
and
cotinine
in
serum
[
exs
.
4166
,
4250
,
4301
,
saliva
[
ex
.
4166
,
and
urine
[
exs
.
4166
,
4211
,
4316
.
in
general
,
the
currently
available
data
support
the
assumption
that
nicotine
and
cotinine
kinetics
parameters
for
smokers
can
be
extrapolated
to
nonsmokers
for
estimating
exposures
to
ets
in
nonsmokers
[
ex
.
424
.
studies
have
also
demonstrated
that
salivary
levels
of
cotinine
are
directly
proportional
to
plasma
levels
[
ex
.
473
,
and
that
urinary
excretion
of
cotinine
is
linearly
related
to
plasma
levels
[
ex
.
482
.
thus
all
three
biological
fluids
provide
a
reasonable
metric
for
nicotine
intake
,
and
thus
can
serve
as
biomarkers
of
ets
exposure
in
nonsmokers
.
there
are
two
potential
difficulties
associated
with
the
use
of
cotinine
as
a
biomarker
for
ets
.
the
first
is
the
presence
of
nicotine
in
the
diet
.
several
foods
,
including
tea
,
tomatoes
,
and
potatoes
,
have
been
shown
to
contain
nicotine
in
measurable
quantities
[
exs
.
449
,
481
,
4281
.
however
,
a
study
of
3383
nonsmokers
was
unable
to
substantiate
an
effect
of
tea
drinking
on
serum
cotinine
levels
for
selfreported
self
reported
daily
tea
consumption
[
ex
.
4301
.
the
same
study
did
find
a
strong
correlation
between
selfreported
self
reported
ets
exposure
and
serum
cotinine
level
.
