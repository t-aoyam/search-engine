:
the
available
data
do
not
indicate
any
economic
or
biological
problems
in
the
fishery
.
the
amendment
indicates
that
the
average
sizes
of
most
species
of
fish
landed
have
held
relatively
steady
since
1987
,
and
the
average
size
of
swordfish
has
increased
since
1987
.
aside
from
this
commenter
,
no
other
participants
in
the
fishery
have
indicated
that
their
catches
or
profits
have
declined
,
except
for
fishermen
who
were
effectively
precluded
from
fishing
traditional
grounds
by
the
area
closures
imposed
around
the
main
hawaiian
islands
.
there
is
no
indication
that
catch
rates
have
decreased
due
to
excessive
fishing
pressure
.
the
council
and
nmfs
acknowledge
that
the
expanded
longline
fishery
has
been
operating
for
only
a
few
years
and
that
many
interested
parties
have
expressed
concern
about
possible
longterm
long
term
impacts
on
the
stocks
or
other
fisheries
and
protected
species
.
therefore
,
the
council
has
proposed
an
approach
to
allow
a
limited
increase
in
the
fishery
with
greater
flexibility
for
fishermen
to
make
business
decisions
.
controlled
expansion
of
the
fishery
will
provide
a
basis
for
determining
whether
the
expanded
fishery
is
affecting
fish
stocks
or
fishery
participants
and
whether
corrective
action
is
needed
.
if
information
later
indicates
problems
,
the
amendment
includes
framework
procedures
to
address
those
problems
.
allowing
upgrading
of
smaller
vessels
is
intended
to
provide
a
fair
competitive
opportunity
within
the
longline
fishery
for
owners
of
small
vessels
that
were
effectively
precluded
from
fishing
when
the
longline
area
closures
went
into
effect
.
it
is
not
expected
that
all
participants
will
acquire
larger
vessels
to
the
maximum
size
permitted
,
though
some
shift
to
larger
vessels
is
expected
.
finally
,
disapproval
of
the
amendment
would
result
in
no
limit
on
participation
.
no
change
was
made
to
the
rule
in
response
to
these
comments
.
comment
(

:
one
environmental
conservation
organization
commented
in
opposition
to
the
amendment
.
this
organization
indicated
the
moratorium
on
new
entry
should
be
continued
until
data
are
available
from
the
longline
observer
program
and
other
sources
to
assess
impacts
on
sea
turtles
and
the
status
of
fish
stocks
harvested
by
the
longline
fishery
.
this
organization
felt
that
the
allowable
incidental
take
of
sea
turtles
is
excessive
and
was
concerned
that
the
amendment
would
result
in
additional
effort
and
thus
a
risk
of
higher
turtle
takes
and
jeopardy
to
turtle
stocks
.
the
commenter
also
was
critical
of
the
low
level
of
coverage
achieved
in
the
voluntary
program
.
response
(

:
the
moratorium
terminated
at
12
midnight
on
04/22/1994
.
if
the
amendment
had
been
disapproved
,
there
would
no
longer
have
been
any
limitation
on
the
number
or
size
of
longline
vessels
in
the
fishery
.
the
moratorium
may
not
be
continued
unless
the
secretary
rejects
the
amendment
and
issues
regulations
under
the
secretarys
amendment
authority
.
in
the
secretarys
view
,
the
framework
procedures
of
amendment
7
allow
relatively
quick
action
to
adjust
management
measures
if
needed
to
protect
sea
turtles
or
fish
stocks
.
a
mandatory
observer
program
was
established
by
an
interim
final
rule

on

(

.
by
04/10/1994
,
14
completed
trips
had
been
observed
.
this
represents
a
significant
increase
in
observer
coverage
over
the
voluntary
program
.
consultations
under
section
7
of
the
endangered
species
act
(
esa
)
have
been
reinitiated
and
will
consider
data
from
the
voluntary
and
mandatory
observer
programs
,
and
information
on
the
status
and
trends
of
turtle
populations
,
to
determine
whether
new
conservation
recommendations
or
reasonable
and
prudent
measures
should
be
applied
in
this
fishery
.
with
respect
to
the
impacts
of
the
fishery
on
fish
stocks
,
the
available
data
indicate
that
no
stocks
have
been
affected
by
the
longline
fishery
to

no

have
been

comment
(

:
two
other
commenters
recommended
partial
disapproval
of
the
amendment
.
both
favored
limited
entry
for
the
longline
fishery
,
but
also
favored
limiting
harvesting
capacity
of
the
fleet
by
only
allowing
vessel
upgrades
for
safety
,
and
not
providing
permits
to
those
who
did
not
fish
in
the
moratorium
.
one
emphasized
the
incomplete
and
dated
nature
of
much
of
the
data
used
and
criticized
the
management
system
and
fishery
for
the
waste
of
sharks
,
noting
that
only
a
very
small
portion
of
the
shark
catch
is
retained
;
this
commenter
also
suggested
a
quota
system
could
be
developed
.
the
other
commenter
proposed
that
,
if
vessel
upgrades
are
allowed
,
gear
upgrades
should
be
limited
.
a
harvesting
capacity
quota
approach
should
be
developed
in
a
threetier
three
tier
(
small
,
medium
,
and
large
)
vessel
system
.
this
commenter
feared
that
longliners
could
decimate
stocks
and
then
move
to
new
areas
,
leaving
local
fishermen
to
pay
the
price
.
both
commenters
also
suggested
that
some
council
members
who
worked
on
the
amendment
had
financial
conflicts
of
interest
.
response
(
4
:
many
elements
of
the
amendment
already
comport
with
the
commenters
'
recommendations
;
for
example
,
the
maximum
number
of
permits
may
be
no
more
than
the
number
in
the
moratorium
,
and
permits
will
not
be
issued
to
persons
who
did
not
fish
(
excluding
small
vessels
and
persons
who
obtained
longline
permits
due
to
linkage
with
lobster
permits
)
during
the
moratorium
.
however
,
the
council
chose
to
allow
more
flexibility
for
vessel
upgrades
to
equalize
the
opportunity
for
all
vessel
owners
to
compete
in
the
fishery
.
the
best
scientific
information
available
has
been
used
.
the
council
and
nmfs
acknowledged
the
limitations
of
the
data
.
the
amendment
includes
framework
procedures
so
management
adjustments
can
be
made
rapidly
if
the
data
indicate
a
need
for
changes
.
the
council
chose
not
to
recommend
a
quota
system
,
given
the
inadequacy
of
data
to
determine
allowable
catch
and
allocations
to
different
fishermen
.
the
council
considered
gear
limitations
but
recognized
the
serious
difficulty
in
enforcing
such
limitations
due
to
limited
atsea
at
sea
enforcement
resources
.
issues
of
discards
and
bycatch
have
been
raised
to
the
council
,
and
the
council
will
review
the
data
collected
under
the
mandatory
observer
program
to
determine
how
to
address
these
issues
in
the
future
.
the
council
considered
establishment
of
a
harvesting
capacity
management
system
and
concluded
that
a
fair
and
effective
system
would
require
much
additional
data
collection
and
analysis
.
the
council
agreed
to
continue
work
on
alternate
means
to
control
effort
and
capacity
for
implementation
through
the
framework
procedures
in
the
amendment
.
regarding
conflict
of
interest
,
the
magnuson
fishery
conservation
and
management
act
(
magnuson
act
)
permits
council
members
with
financial
interests
in
harvesting
,
marketing
,
or
processing
activities
to
vote
on
matters
that
affect
those
interests
,
if
disclosed
publicly
in
accordance
with
regulations
governing
regional
fishery
management
councils
at

no
changes
were
made
in
the
regulations
in

to
these
