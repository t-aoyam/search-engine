supplementary
information
:
section
306
of
the
controlled
substances
act
,
(
21
usc
.
826
,
requires
the
attorney
general
to
establish
aggregate
production
quotas
for
controlled
substances
in
schedules
i
and
ii
each
year
.
this
responsibility
has
been
delegated
to
the
administrator
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration
pursuant
to
§
0
100
of
title
28
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations
.
on
10/01/1993
,
an
interim
rule
establishing
revised
1993
aggregate
production
quotas
for
controlled
substances
in
schedules
i
and
ii
was
published
in
the
federal
register
(
58
fr
51382
.
one
comment
was
received
from
a
company
supporting
the
use
of
the
interim
rule
in
establishing
aggregate
production
quotas
under
certain
circumstances
.
the
interim
rule
is
adopted
without
change
.
this
rule
is
not
a
significant
regulatory
action
and
therefore
has
not
been
reviewed
by
the
office
of
management
and
budget
pursuant
to
executive
order
12866
.
these
actions
have
been
analyzed
in
accordance
with
the
principles
and
criteria
contained
in
executive
order
12612
,
and
it
has
been
determined
that
this
matter
does
not
have
sufficient
federalism
implications
to
warrant
the
preparation
of
a
federalism
assessment
.
the
administrator
hereby
certifies
that
this
action
will
have
no
significant
impact
upon
small
entities
whose
interests
must
be
considered
under
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
,
5
usc
.
601
,
et
seq
.
the
establishment
of
annual
aggregate
production
quotas
for
schedules
i
and
ii
controlled
substances
is
mandated
by
law
and
by
international
commitments
of
the
united
states
.
such
quotas
impact
predominantly
upon
major
manufacturers
of
the
affected
controlled
substance
.
therefore
,
under
the
authority
vested
in
the
attorney
general
by
section
306
of
the
csa
of
1970
(
21
usc
.
826
)
and
delegated
to
the
administrator
by
§
0
100
of
title
28
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations
,
the
administrator
of
the
dea
hereby
establishes
the
following
revised
1993
