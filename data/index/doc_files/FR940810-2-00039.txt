discussion
:
the
existing
wastewater
treatment
facility
,
completed
in
1963
,
is
still
able
to
be
operated
safely
and
reliably
for
a
few
more
years
,
although
design
standards
have
changed
considerably
since
that
time
.
it
is
possible
that
certain
design
details
,
such
as
wastewater
stream
source
and
type
,
may
depend
on
sitewide
decisions
regarding
the
location
and
use
of
other
facilities
at
lanl
.
detailed
design
for
a
replacement
facility
cannot
be
started
until
the
nepa
review
is
completed
,
which
in
turn
would
affect
construction
schedules
.
initial
recommendation

part
of
a
series
of
proposed
infrastructure
renovations
to
a
40yearold
year
facility
used
for
various
research
projects
.
cmr
supports
activities
in
several
other
lanl
facilities
.
the
purpose
of
the
upgrades
is
to
reduce
risk
,
enhance
the
safety
margin
,
and
provide
for
the
continued
safe
,
reliable
,
and
effective
use
of
the
facility
to
support
lanl
missions
for
at
least
another
20
to
30
years
.
some
renovations
were
covered
by
prior
nepa

and
are
currently
underway

since
then
,
environmental
,
safety
and
security
design
and
operating
requirements
have
changed
.
utility
and
infrastructure
systems
at
cmr
have
aged
and
need
to
be
replaced
.
although
current
operations
in
cmr
are
conducted
in
a
way
that
protects
the
safety
of
workers
,
the
public
and
the
environment
,
some
utility
and
infrastructure
upgrades
would
allow
cmr
operations
to
more
closely
adhere
to
current
environmental
,
safety
,
and
health
requirements
.
these
include
improving
or
replacing
the
buildings
structural
,
ventilation
,
electrical
,
facility
monitoring
,
waste
management
,
and
security
systems
.
another
element
of
the
cmr
upgrade
projects
would
refurbish
wings
2
and
4
at
cmr
,
to
accommodate
lanl
program
needs
.
if
the
upgrades
were
deferred
until
after
the
sweis
,
cmr
would
continue
to
be
used
but
would
also
continue
to
deteriorate
as
the
building
systems
aged
.
initial
recommendation
:
analyze
in
the
ea
those
components
of
the
proposed
upgrades
that
are
needed
to
maintain
the
existing
operation
infrastructure
,
improve
safety
of
operations
to
workers
and
the
general
public
,
enhance
cmr
environmental
management
systems
,
and
provide
for
improved
security
.
include
in
the

the
remainder
of
the
proposed
cmr
upgrades
which
relate

the
proposal
would
consolidate
in
one
building
the
high

work
now
done
in
several
locations
at
lanl
;
the
existing
facilities
have
deteriorated
substantially
and
are
inadequate
to
reliably
support
current
needs
.
lanl
has
an
ongoing
mission
to
evaluate
aging
weapons
to
ensure
that
the
enduring
nuclear
weapons
stockpile
remains
safe
and
reliable
;
therefore
,
lanl
must
maintain
the
capability
to
assure
the
continuity
and
reliability
of

and
the
safety
of
workers
performing
those
tests

discussion
:
this
is
a
smallscale
small
scale
construction
project
to
consolidate
ongoing
activities
at
lanl
and
would
not
increase
lanls
existing
testing
program
.
if
constructing
the
building
were
deferred
until
after
the
sweis
,
testing
and
evaluation
would
continue
in
the
existing
facilities
.
further
deterioration
of
the
existing
buildings
could
disrupt
the
evaluation
program
and
create
uncertainty
in
lanls
ability
to
safely
and
reliably
test
high

revision
to
1986
ea
.
the
1986
ea
covers
actions
currently
needed
to
correct
identified
design
and
construction
deficiencies
.
the
revised
proposal
is
to
increase
the
storage
capacity
of
an
existing
nuclear
materials
storage
vault
from
about
66
metric
tons
of
plutonium
to
about
25
metric

(
lanls
current
inventory
is
about
26
metric
tons
,
with
a
corresponding
increase
in
heat
removal
capability
from
20
kilowatts
to
75
kilowatts
.
the
proposed
upgrades
would
also
allow
storage
of
material
that
generates
more
heat
due
to
radioactive
decay
dp
08/10/1993
discussion
:
the
1986
ea
analyzed
constructing
and
operating
the
existing
vault
to
consolidate
nuclear
material
storage
at
lanl
.
the
proposal
was
revised
in
1993
to
allow
for
increased
storage
capability
in
the
vault
;
the
nepa
determination
was
to
revise
the
1986
ea
to
provide
the
nepa
review
for
the
increased
capacity
.
if
the
revised
nepa
review
were
to
proceed
,
doe
could
make
an
early
decision
on
whether
to
increase
the
storage
capability
of
the
existing
vault
.
this
would
be
necessary
if
,
prior
to
completing
sitewide
decisions
,
doe
needed
to
store
at
lanl
more
material
,
or
different
types
of
material
,
than
is
now
onsite
on
site
or
anticipated
under
current
mission
workloads
.
if
a
decision
to
increase
the
capacity
were
deferred
until
after
the
sweis
,
doe
and
lanl
could
continue
to
work
towards
correcting
design
and
construction
deficiencies
but
could
not
undertake
work
that
would
lead
to
increased
storage
capacity
.
the
sweis
will
be
used
to
help
develop
a
nuclear
materials
storage
and
handling
strategy
,
which
would
include
projections
of
amounts
of
material
anticipated
to
be
on
site
if
lanls
weapons
mission
changed
;
sitewide
decisions
could
influence
decisions
on
the
future
use
and
capacity
of
the
vault
.
initial
recommendation
:
include
in
sweis
the
proposal
to
increase
the
vaults
capacity
as
part
of
nuclear
materials
storage

discussion
:
the

the
sweis
will

develop
a
waste
management
strategy
;
analyzing
impacts
of
incinerating

could
be
an
important
element
of

initial

include
treatment
operation

acre
lowlevel
low

radioactive
waste
management
area
which
is
anticipated
to
reach
capacity
in
3

5
years

the
original
proposal
was
to
expand
by
an
additional
70
acres
to
provide
an
additional
20
years
of
disposal
capability
;
a
smaller
30acre
acre
area
is
also
considered
,
as
well
as
a
5acre
acre
area
that
would
provide
disposal
capability
for
up
to
8
years
.
there
are
no
archeological
sites
in

area

discussion
:
the
original
proposal
would
provide
longterm
long
term
,
largescale
large
scale
expansion
of
the
waste
disposal
area
.
some
expansion
of
lanls
waste

capacity
would
be
needed
in
3
to
5
years
to
accommodate
environmental
restoration
,
dampd
,
and
other
operational
waste
.
it
is
not
clear
at
this
time
what
the
projected
volumes
of
waste
might
be
over
the
next
20
years
.
lanl
is
increasing
waste
minimization
efforts
and
it
is
possible
that
site
missions
could
change
;
the
sitewide
analysis
will
help
develop
projections
of
waste
volume
and
type
.
the
smaller
,
5acre
acre
proposal
would
allow
for
up
to
8
years
of
additional
disposal
capacity
in
the
event
that
it
is
needed
while
the
sitewide
analysis
is
being
completed

if
no
expansion
takes
place
prior

the
sweis
,
it
is
possible
that
existing
waste
disposal
areas
may
be
filled
prior
to
completing
sitewide
decisions
