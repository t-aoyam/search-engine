fda
tentatively

above
30

,
therefore
,

)
unless
the

the

it
,
is
packaged
in

that
is

to
prevent

,
while

for

iron

and

with
30
mg
or

to

that

.
fdas
tentative
conclusion
to
use
30
mg
per
unitdose
unit
dose
as
the
threshold
for
requiring
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
is
based
on
its
consideration
of
a
number
factors
including
:
(
1
)
the
amount
of
ingested
iron
that
can
cause
pediatric
fatality
;
(
2
)
the
amount
of
ingested
iron
that
can
cause
significant
iron
poisoning
;
(
3
)
the
average
number
of
dosage
units
associated
with
pediatric
fatalities
;
(

)
the
types
and
potency
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
associated
with
pediatric
iron
poisoning
fatalities
;
(

)
information
on
how
iron
products
are
sold
;
and
(
6
)
the
citizen
petitions
that
were
submitted
to
fda
.
these
factors
pointed
to
the
use
of
30
mg
per
unitdose
unit
dose
as
a
threshold
.
as
discussed
above
,
the
toxicity
of
any
iron
ingestion
is
related
to
the
total
amount
of
iron
ingested
and
absorbed
(
section
ib
.
of
this
document
.
ingestion
of
250
mg
iron
per
kg
of
body
weight
(
25
g
total
iron
for
a
10
kg
child
)
is
typically
considered
to
be
a
lethal
dose
of
iron
.
however
,
there
have
been
reports
of
fatalities
from
ingestion
of
lesser
amounts
(
less
than
25
g
)
of
iron
,
and
the
available
data
bear
this
out
.
for
example
,
table
5
shows
that
several
pediatric
fatalities
have
been
associated
with
ingestion
of
approximately
1
g
of
iron
.
moreover
,
the
amount
of
iron
that
can
cause
serious
adverse
effects
is
given
as
60
mg
kg
(
section
ib
.
of
this
document
.
for
a
10
kg
child
this
translates
to
600
mg
of
iron
.
fda
recognizes
that
there
is
variability
among
individuals
with
respect
to
the
lethal
dose
of
iron
.
because
of
this
variability
,
and
because
of
the
variable
size
and
age
of
children
at
risk
,
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
,
to
protect
the
wide
range
of
susceptible
children
,
it
is
necessary
through
packaging
measures
(
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
)
to
limit
pediatric
access
to
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drugs
and
dietary
supplements
at
potencies
that
can
be
reasonably
expected
to
provide
1
g
of
iron
.
restricting
pediatric
access
to
this
amount
of
iron
by
packaging
measures
will
substantially
reduce
the
potential
for
a
fatal
or
significant
iron
poisoning
outcome
should
an
accidental
pediatric
ingestion
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
occur
.
as
discussed
above
,
because
of
the
time
and
effort
needed
to
access
products
contained
in
unitdoor
unit
door
packaging
,
the
likelihood
that
young
children
will
be
able
to
ingest
a
lethal
amount
of
iron
will
be
significantly
reduced
,
thereby
reducing
the
likelihood
that
they
will
be
seriously
injured
or
die
.
in
the
37
case
reports
of
iron
poisoning
fatalities
available
,
the
average
number
of
dosage
units
ingested
by
the
pediatric
victim
was
39
tablets
or
capsules
,
with
a
range
of
5
to
98
(
table
2
.
fda
notes
that
ingestion
of
39
tablets
or
capsules
at
potencies
of
25
to
30
mg
iron
per
dosage
unit
is
sufficient
to
provide
a
potentially
lethal
dose
of
iron
(
ie
,
approximately
1000
mg
)
to
a
young
child
.
