for

for
the
dismissal
of

otherwise
admissible

this
provision
accords
with
existing
law

traditionally
,
matters
relating
to
communications
with
represented
persons
have
been
treated
as
matters
of
attorney
discipline
without
granting

virtually
all

adopted
some
version
of
dr

these

accordingly
,
communications
with

that
are
undertaken
pursuant
to
these
rules
should
be
considered
`
authorized
by
law
'
within
the
meaning
of
rules
adopted
by
the
various
states
.
such
communications
will
therefore
be
consistent
with
state
rules
wherever
state
bar
authorities
have
adopted
a
rule
containing
the
`

,
no

will
arise
between

and

in

in

states
that
do
not
currently
include

repeal

,
the
proposed
rule
may
conflict
with
their
provisions
governing

.
the
second
sentence
of
this
section
provides
that
in
those
cases
the
proposed

will
preempt
the
application
of
conflicting
state
and
local
rules
as
they
relate
to

the
longstanding
position
of
the

is
that
the

bars
`
any

by
a

impose
sanctions
on

'
manual
in
addition
to
the
promulgation
of
the
proposed
regulations
discussed
above
,
the
department
proposes
to
add
several
new
provisions
to
the
united
states
attorneys
'
manual
to
provide
additional
guidance
to
department
attorneys
when
dealing
with
individuals
or
entities
represented
by
counsel
during
criminal
or
civil
law
enforcement
investigations
and
proceedings
.
those
provisions
are
set
forth
in
full
below
as
part
of
this
commentary
.
the
decision
to
include
some
restrictions
in
the
manual
while
other
restrictions
are
contained
in
the
rule
was
an
important
one
.
in
the
process
of
determining
what
the
appropriate
departmental
policy
should
be
,
it
became
clear
that
any
regulation
would
have
to
apply
to
a
variety
of
circumstances
,
including
:
white
collar
and
organized
crime
investigations
,
complex
conspiracy
investigations
,
individuals
whose
counsel
are
paid
by
a
third
party
,
and
individuals
fearful
of
their
counsel
for
various
reasons
.
accordingly
,
the
department
determined
that
the
regulations
should
be
broad
in
scope
and
should
provide
unambiguous
guidance
that
would
not
adversely
affect
federal
law
enforcement
efforts
.
thus
,
the
regulations
distinguish
between
the
investigative
period
before
indictment
,
arrest
,
or
the
filing
of
a
complaint
and
the
period
after
arrest
or
the
commencement
of
formal
proceedings
.
they
also
distinguish
between
communications
that
are
part
of
a
factual
investigation
and
negotiations
of
plea
agreements
,
settlements
and
similar
legal
arrangements
.
at
the
same
time
,
the
manual
revisions
require
that
government
attorneys
consider
the
principles
underlying
the
basic
prohibitions
in
a
much
wider
variety
of
circumstances
.
the
department
expects
all
department
attorneys
involved
in
criminal
or
civil
law
enforcement
proceedings
to
adhere
to
these
provisions
.
failure
to
do
so
will
result
in
appropriate
departmental
discipline
.
