analysis
the
following
items
are
the
basis
for
proposed
approval
of
the
sip
revision
.
the
state
has
met
the
requirements
of
section

)
by
submitting
a
sip
revision
that
implements
all
required
program
elements
.

.
the
average
vehicle
occupancy
section
182d1b
)
requires
that
the
state
determine
the
avo
at
the
time
the
sip
revision
is
submitted
.
the
state
has
met
this
requirement
.
in
1992
,
avo
was
established
by
a
telephone
survey
,
and
based
on
demographic
characteristics
,
the
state
has
been
divided
into
two
distinct
avo
zones
.
the
urban
area
zone
includes
the
counties
of
bergen
,
essex
,
hudson
,
union
,
and
part
of
passaic
(
municipalities
of
clifton
,
paterson
,
and
passaic
,
and
has
an
established
avo
of

.
the
avo
of
the
suburban
zone
is

and
includes
the
counties
of
burlington
,
camden
,
cumberland

remainder

.
the
target
apo
section
182d1b
)
requires
that
the
target
apo
must
be
not
less
than
25
percent
above
the
avo
for
the
nonattainment
area
.
an
approvable
sip
revision
for
this
program
must
include
the
target
apo
.
the
state
has
fulfilled
this
requirement
by
computing
target
apos
that
meet
the
25
percent
mandate
.
the
suburban
zone
maintains
a
single
area
avo
and
apo
,
but
the
single
urbanized
zone
has
been
divided
into
three
distinct
target
areas
.

these

etr
program
based
on
the
requirements
of
the
clean
air
act
,
state
or
local
law
must
establish
etr
requirements
for
employers
with
100
or
more
employees
at
a
worksite
within
severe
and
extreme
ozone
nonattainment
areas
.
in
the
etr
guidance
issued
12/19/1992
,
epa
states
that
automatic
coverage
of
employers
of
100
or
more
should
be
included
in
the
provision
.
in
addition
,
states
should
develop
procedures
for
notifying
employers
of
the
etr
requirements
.
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
fulfilled
these
requirements
.
epa
will
allow
new
jersey
to
provide
additional
time
to
employers
that
request
an
extension
.
the
rule
requires
employers
to
comply
by
1996
but
allows
an
extension
for
the
penalties
for
noncompliance
until
1997
.
this
is
allowed
because
the
clean
air
act
states
that
employers
must
comply
within
four
years
of
program
submittal
by
the
state
.
since
the
program
was
submitted
on
11/15/1993
,
the
state
may
allow
employers
until
11/15/1997
to
comply
with
the
program
.
the
rule
specifies
that
a
contract
employee
is
defined
as
working
at
a
location
for
a
least
six
months
over
the
course
of
a
year
.
employees
that
work
less
that
six
months
are
not
incorporated
into
the
program
.
the
state
believes
that
this
is
appropriate
since
an
employee
that
works
less
than
six
months
at
one
location
is
likely
to
work
more
than
six
months
at
another
location
.
although
in
concurrence
,
epa
is
not
comfortable
with
a
six
month
period
and
would
prefer
a
period
of
shorter
duration
.
state
and
or
local
laws
must
require
that
initial
compliance
plans
`
convincingly
demonstrate
'
prospective
compliance
.
approval
of
the
sip
revision
depends
on
the
ability
of
the
regulations
to
ensure
that
the
clean
air
act
requirement
to
`
convincingly
demonstrate
'
compliance
will
be
met
.
this
demonstration
can
take
on
any
of
four
forms
or
any
combination
of
these
.
one
option
is
for
a
state
to
include
in
the
sip
evidence
that
agency
resources
are
available
for
a
planbyplan
plan
by
plan
review
of
employer
selected
measures
to
ensure
the
high
quality
of
compliance
plans
.
a
second
option
is
for
the
regulations
in
the
sip
to
contain
a
convincing
minimum
set
of
measures
that
all
employers
must
implement
.
these
measures
will
be
subject
to
review
and
approval
by
epa
as
adequate
when
the
sip
is
processed
.
