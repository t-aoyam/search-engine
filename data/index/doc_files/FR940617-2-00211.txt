where

to
prepare

epa
strongly
encourages
applicants
to
read
the
solicitation
notice
carefully
.
this
notice
contains
all
the
information
and
forms
necessary
to
prepare
a
preapplication
application
.
if
your
project
is
selected
as
a
finalist
after
the
evaluation
process
is
concluded
,
epa
will
provide
you
with
additional
forms

completed
in

to
process

.
how
much
money
can
i
request
and
how
does
the
dollar
amount
requested
affect
my
chance
of
being
funded
?
applicants
may
request
up
to
the
statutory
ceiling
of
$
250000
in
environmental
education
grant
funds
for
any
one
grant
.
however
,
preapplications
applications
which
request
relatively
small
amounts
of
funding
have
a
much
better
chance
of
being
funded
because
epa
awards
a
much
greater
number
of
grants
at
lower
funding
levels
.
a
significant
number
of
small
awards
are
made
because
epa
is
required
,
under
section
6i
)
of
the
act
,
to
award
25
%
of
funds
for
grants
of
$
5000
or
less
.
in
addition
,
epa
has
chosen
to
award
very
few
of
the
largest
grants
(
eg
,
those
over
$
100000
)
so
that
we
may
support
a
greater
number
of
efforts
.
thus
,
your
chance
of
being
funded
increases
dramatically
as
the
amount
of
money
you
request
decreases
as
illustrated
below
.
epa
has
awarded
grants
under
the
environmental
education
grants
program
in
fiscal
years
1992
,
1993
,
and
1994
.
individual
awards
have
ranged
from
less
than
$
5000
up
to
$
250000
.
during
this
three
year
period
,
epa
has
funded
only
about
10
proposals
annually
for
projects
requesting
between
$
25001
and
$
250000
;
only
1
proposal
each
year
has
been
funded
at
or
near
the
$
250000
level
.
by
contrast
,
epa
has
funded
about
30
proposals
annually
for
projects
requesting
between
$
5001
and
$
25000
.
furthermore
,
epa
has
funded
about
200
proposals
annually
for
projects
requesting
$
5000
or
less
.
epa
has
received
between
1500
and
3000
preapplications
applications
each
year
.
to
increase
your
chance
of
obtaining
funding
in
fy
1995
,
epa
strongly
encourages
applicants
to
request
regional
grants
of
$
5000
or
less
.
if
larger
sums
are
needed
,
epa
strongly
encourages
applicants
to
request
a
headquarters
grant
closer
to
$
25000
rather
than
the
maximum
of
$
250000
.

has
this

been
established
and
what
laws
and
regulations
do
i
need
to
follow
in

for
a

?
on
11/16/1990
,
the
president
signed
the
national
environmental
education
act
(
pub
.
l
.
101619
)
into
law
.
section
6
of
the
act
requires
that
the
us
.
environmental
protection
agency
(
epa
)
administer
an
environmental
education
grants
program
to
support
projects
that
design
,
demonstrate
,
or
disseminate
practices
,
methods
,
or
techniques
related
to
environmental
education
.
the
act
also
requires
that
epa
establish
a
program
which
includes
a
process
for
soliciting
,
selecting
,
supervising
,
evaluating
results
,
and
disseminating
information
on
the
effectiveness
of
projects
funded
under
this
program
.
epa
published
the
environmental
education
grant
program
regulations
in
the
federal
register
on
03/09/1992
which
provides
additional
information
on
how
epa
is
administering
this

how
much
money
has
congress
appropriated
for
this
grants
program
?
the
act
requires
that
38
%
of
the
total
funds
congress
appropriates
in
a
given
fiscal
year
under
the
national
environmental
education
act
be
awarded
as
grants
under
the
section
6
environmental
education
grants
program
.
based
on
this
percentage
,
epa
has
awarded
approximately
$
81
million
in
grants
under
section
6
of
the
act
over
the
past
three
years
(
approximately
$
25
in
fiscal
year
1992
,
$
27
in
fiscal
year
1993
,
and
$
29
in
fiscal
year
1994
.
epa
will
award
grants
in
fiscal
year
1995
subject
to
the
amount
of
funds
appropriated
by
congress
.
epa
may
use
up
to
15
%
of
these
funds
to
support
environmental
education
projects
which
meet
the
requirements
under
section
6
,
but
are
outside
of
the
competitive
process
established
under
the
solicitation
notice
.
if
funds
are
used
in
this
manner
,
epa
will
publish
a
separate
solicitation
notice
in
the
federal
register
to
cover
the
award
of
these
funds
.
