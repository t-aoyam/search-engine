ozark
argues
that
the
ability
to
withhold
a
vote
or
`
veto
'
any
particular
transaction
does
not
exist
as
far
as
open
access
transportation
arrangements
are
concerned
.
ozark
states
that
open
access
pipelines
,
including
ozark
,
are
required
by
§
2848b
)
and
2849b
)
to
transport
natural
gas
on
an
open
and
nondiscriminatory
discriminatory
basis
.
ozark
asserts
that
it
is
clearly
prohibited
from
taking
actions
that
would
unduly
prefer
the
marketing
affiliates
of
ozarks
partners
and
ozarks
partners
have
an
obligation
to
the
partnership
to
operate
the
pipeline
within
legal
parameters
.
ozark
submits
that
its
commissionapproved
commission
approved
firm
and
interruptible
rate
schedules
establish
the
criteria
which
control
who
receives
transportation
service
from
ozark
.
ozark
contends
that
decisions
as
to
who
will
be
permitted
to
ship
on
ozark
may
not
be
made
at
the
whim
of
a
particular
ozark
partner
.
ozark
asserts
that
if
the
tariff
criteria
are
met
,
the
request
must
be
granted
.
ozark
states
that
,
in
fact
,
at
a
management
committee
meeting
held
on
06/26/1991
,
ozarks
management
committee
,
consisting
of
representatives
of
each
of
the
partners
,
voted
unanimously
to
approve
a
resolution
authorizing
the
president
of
ozark
or
his
designee
to
execute
interruptible
transportation
agreements
on
behalf
of
ozark
.
thus
,
ozark
contends
,
each
of
the
partners
ceded
to
the
operator
the
authority
to
enter
into
interruptible
transportation
agreements
.
ozark
argues
that
no
partnership
vote
is
required
and
the
operator
is
bound
by
the
tariff
.
ozark
asserts
that
it
should
be
obvious
that
not
only
are
tennessee
ozark
and
ozark
pipeline
corporation
not
free
to
veto
transportation
transactions
but
each
has
relinquished
any
right
it
might
otherwise
have
to
vote
on
such
transactions
.
ozark
submits
that
the
record
before
the
commission
shows
an
absence
of
control
.
ozark
asserts
that
the
record
before
the
commission
shows
a
complete
absence
of
any
vetoing
of
any
transportation
transaction
by
any
ozark
partner
,
consistent
with
the
delegation
of
authority
to
enter
into
such
transportation
agreements
.
ozark
argues
that
the
operator
is
required
to
act
in
accordance
with
its
fiduciary
responsibilities
to
the
partnership
,
not
inconsistent
with
those
responsibilities
.
ozark
contends
that
the
commissions
finding
here
that
one
partner
could
prefer
its
marketing
affiliate
by
vetoing
transportation
for
others
is
directly
contrary
to
the
commissions
prior
findings
in
this
case
that
`
there
are
no
facts
before
us
in
this
proceeding
which
indicate
that
ozark
has
discriminated
in
offering
transportation
services
to
any
party

footnote

ozark
submits
that
previously
the
commission
assumed
that
the
ozark
partners
would
act
together
to
provide
preferences
to
marketing
affiliates
of
one
of
the
partners
or
that
one
of
the
ozark
partners
would
be
willing
to
grant
preferences
to
their
ozark
partners
in
the
hopes
of
obtaining
reciprocal
preferences
.
ozark
states
that
here
the
commission
assumes
that
one
of
the
partners
will
simply
veto
transactions
that
would
benefit
the
partnership
because
the
transaction
might
compete
with
a
transaction
of
one
of
its
affiliates
.
ozark
asserts
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
any
such
assumption
.
ozark
contends
that
to
make
such
a
finding
the
commission
would
have
to
assume
that
ozark
would
violate
its
tariff
,
the
commissions
regulations
,
and
texas
partnership
law
.
ozark
argues
that
the
commission
would
also
have
to
assume
that
its
prior
finding
that
there
are
no
facts
showing
discrimination
in
ozarks
offering
of
transportation
is
wrong
.
ozark
submits
that
not
one
of
these
assumptions
is
logical
,
consistent
with
any
information
relating
to
ozark
,
or
supported
by
evidence
in
the
record
.
ozark
asserts
that
all
of
the
evidence
shows
that
such
control
does
not
exist
including
the
fact
that
numerous
transportation
transactions
have
been
conducted
by
ozark
for
independent
marketers
which
compete
with
the
marketing
affiliates
of
ozark
partners
.
ozark
states
that
its
decisions
as
to
who
it
will
ship
for
are
subject
to
review
by
this
commission
and
this
commissions
complaint
procedures
.
ozark
contends
that
if
the
commission
were
to
find
that
ozark
had
engaged
in
such
conduct
,
enforcement
proceedings
would
commence
and
ozark
would
either
be
ordered
to
provide
the
service
required
or
its
blanket
certificate
would
be
revoked
.
finally
,
ozark
argues
that
it
does
not
control
any
of
its
individual
partners
,
is
not
controlled
by
any
of
its
individual
partners
,
and
is
not
under
common
control
with
any
of
its
individual
partners
.
it
asserts
that
nothing
in
the
record
before
the
commission
suggests
the
contrary
.
ozark
also
contends
that
the
commission
erred
to
the
extent
that
it
relied
on
the
modified
definition
of
`
control
'
ozark
states
that
in
order
no
.
497a
the
commission
modified
the
definition
of
`
control
'
in
§
1612
.
ozark
states
that
on
01/16/1990
,
it
sought
rehearing
of
order
no
.
497a
.
ozark
states
that
the
commission
issued
an
order
granting
rehearing
for
purpose
of
further
consideration
but
the
commission
has
never
,
to
the
best
of
ozarks
knowledge
,
issued
an
order
on
the
merits
of
ozarks
rehearing
request
.
ozark
states
that
three
years
have
passed
and
numerous
orders
utilizing
the
definition
have
issued
,
including
the
order
in
this
proceeding
,
and
it
considers
its
request
for
rehearing
as
having
been
denied
.
however
,
to
the
extent
that
the
commission
is
applying
the
revised
definition
to
support
the
result
here
,
ozark
seeks
rehearing
.
