a
variety
of
more
stringent
alternatives
were
considered
,
including
more
restrictive
limits
based
on
hap
content
(
rather
than
voc
content
,
more
stringent
voc
limits
,
and
requiring
use
of
pollution
control
equipment
.
these
alternatives
are
discussed
below
.
to
evaluate
other
potential
limits
,
the
epa
gathered
existing
data
on
hap
content
from
marine
coating
manufacturers
and
shipyards
.
information
compiled
from
a
material
safety
data
sheet
(
msds
)
was
used
to
determine
(
estimate
)
the
hap
content
of
each
paint
.
most
of
the
data
came
from
msdss
and
product
data
sheets
.
based
on
these
data
,
the
percentage
of
voc
in
marine
coatings
that
are
hap
varies
from
zero
to
100
percent
and
averaged
30
percent
by
weight
for
all
paints
in
the
project
data
base
.
(
the
hap
content
could
exceed
the
voc
content
in
coatings
containing
nonvoc
voc
hap
)
industry
subsequently
informed
epa
that
the
quality
of
hapspecific
hap
specific
data
on
msdss
is
poor
.
the
msdss
are
prepared
primarily
to
meet
occupational
health
and
safety
administration
(
osha
)
requirements
.
although
one
section
addresses
hazardous
constituents
,
the
industry
indicated
that
information
and
format
required
for
osha
purposes
are
not
as
detailed
or
accurate
as
would
be
desired
for
development
of
a
regulation
.
further
,
the
list
of
hazardous
materials
that
osha
regulations
require
must
be
addressed
in
msdss
is
different
from
the
hap
list
in
section
112b
)
of
the
act
.
in
addition
,
it
is
acceptable
to
give
a
concentration
range
on
the
msds
,
rather
than
a
specific
value
.
finally
,
many
entries
on
the
msds
are
generic
petroleum
solvents
,
such
as
mineral
spirits
,
which
are
mixtures
of
many
organics
(
some
of
which
may
be
hap
)
and
vary
in
composition
from
lot
to
lot
.
because
of
these
drawbacks
in
msds
data
,
the
epa
considered
it
not
accurate
enough
to
be
used
in
setting
limits
for
vohap
.
the
agency
believes
,
however
,
that
the
resulting
data
base
is
sufficiently
accurate
for
use
in
estimating
broad
parameters
,
such
as
the
potential
reduction
associated
with
limitations
on
voc
content
.
enforcement
of
a
limit
on
hap
content
would
require
an
epa
reference
test
method
.
although
one
is
under
development
by
the
agency
,
it
has
not
yet
been
published
.
based
on
the
quality
of
the
hap
content
data
on
the
msdss
and
the
lack
of
an
approved
test
method
for
speciating
and
quantifying
hap
,
the
epa
has
determined
that
voc
will
be
used
as
a
surrogate
to
limit
hap
emissions
.
consequently
,
the
proposed
rule
would
establish
the
vohap
limit
at
the
voc
limit
of
the
california
rules
using
voc
as
a
surrogate
for
hap
and
the
agencys

method
,
method

,
for
determining
compliance
.
the
epa
considered
requiring
limits
more
stringent
than
the
existing
california
limits
.
the
data
base
indicates
that
within
each
category
of
coatings
there
are
coatings
with
voc
contents
below
the
california
limit
.
(
some
may
have
been
developed
in
response
to
the

provisions
of
the
california
regulations
that
provide
for
more
stringent
limits
to
come
into
effect
in

for
some
coating
categories
)
although
coatings
with
lower
voc
contents
than
the
rule
requires
are
marketed
in
each
category
,
they
reportedly
would
not
perform
for
the
full
range
of
potential
applications
within
a
coating
category
.
an
important
consideration
in
examining
control
requirements
for
this
industry
is
us

or
`

'
because
of
the
need
for

for

and
the
demand
for

,
the
navy
oversees

testing
procedures
.
naval
personnel
indicate
an
ongoing
program
to
qualify
lower

.
the
california
rules
were
developed
with
considerable
input
from
the
navy
,
and
according
to
a
naval
representative
,
reflect
the

more

the

they

,
hence

given
these
considerations
,
the
epa
is
proposing

based
on
the

that
limit
