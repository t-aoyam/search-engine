of
the

food

propose
to
amend

and
(

)
by
establishing
an
exemption

there

the
data

material

been
evaluated

discussed

based
on
the
data

information
considered
,
the
agency
concludes
that
the
tolerance
exemptions
will
protect
the
public
health
.
therefore
,
the
tolerance
exemptions
are
established
as
set
forth
below
.
any
person
adversely
affected
by
this
regulation
may
,
within
30
days
after
publication
of
this
document

file
written
objections

request
a
hearing

a

a

the
administrator
determines
that
the
material
submitted
shows
the
following
:
there
is
a
genuine
and
substantial
issue
of
fact
;
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
available
evidence
identified
by
the
requestor
would
,
if
established
,
resolve
one
or
more
of
such
issues
in
favor
of
the
requestor
,
taking
into
account
uncontested
claims
or
facts
to
the
contrary
;
and
resolution
of
the
factual
issues
)
in
the
manner
sought
by
the
requestor
would
be
adequate
to
justify
the
action
requested

under

order
12866
(
58
fr

,
1993
,
the
agency
must
determine
whether
the
regulatory
action
is
`
significant
'
and
therefore
subject
to
review
by
the
office
of
management
and
budget
(

and
the
requirements
of
the
executive
order

under
section
3f
,
the
order
defines
a
`
significant
regulatory
action
'
as
an
action
that
is
likely
to
result
in
a
rule
(

)
having
an
annual
effect
on
the
economy
of
$
100
million

more

affecting

the
terms

determined

not

the

determined
that

establishing

not
have
a
significant
