introduction
this

collection
and

of
asbestos
bulk
materials
by

some
terms
unique
to
asbestos
analysis
are
defined
below
:
amphibole
:
a
family
of
minerals
whose
crystals
are
formed
by
long
,
thin
units
which
have
two
thin
ribbons
of
double
chain
silicate
with
a
brucite
ribbon
in
between
.
the
shape
of
each
unit
is
similar
to
an
`
i
beam
.
minerals
important
in
asbestos
analysis
include

grunerite
,
crocidolite
,
tremolite
-
actinolite
and
anthophyllite
.
asbestos
:
a
term
for
naturally
occurring
fibrous
minerals
.
asbestos

chrysotile

asbestos

tremolite
asbestos
,

asbestos
and
any
of
these
minerals
which
have
been
chemically
treated
or
altered
.
the
precise
chemical
formulation
of
each
species
varies
with
the
location
from
which
it
was
mined

asbestos
fiber
:
a
fiber
of
asbestos
meeting
the
criteria
for
a
fiber
.
(
see
section
35
)
aspect
ratio
:
the
ratio
of
the
length
of
a
fiber
to
its
diameter
usually
defined
as
`
length
:
:
width
,
eg
.
31
.
brucite
:
a
sheet
mineral
with
the
composition
mgoh
)
central
stop
dispersion
staining
(
microscope
:
this
is
a
dark
field
microscope
technique
that
images
particles
using
only
light
refracted
by
the
particle
,
excluding
light
that
travels
through
the
particle
unrefracted
.
this
is
usually
accomplished
with
a
mccrone
objective
or
other
arrangement
which
places
a
circular
stop
with
apparent
aperture
equal
to
the
objective
aperture
in
the
back
focal
plane
of
the
microscope
.
cleavage
fragments
:
mineral
particles
formed
by
the
comminution
of
minerals
,
especially
those
characterized
by
relatively
parallel
sides
and
moderate
aspect
ratio
.
differential
counting
:
the
term
applied
to
the
practice
of
excluding
certain
kinds
of
fibers
from
a
phase
contrast
asbestos
count
because
they
are
not
asbestos
.
fiber
:
a
particle
longer
than
or
equal
to
5
&
mum
with
a
length
to
width
ratio
greater
than
or
equal
to
31
.
this
may
include
cleavage
fragments
.
(
see
section
35
of
this
appendix
.
phase
contrast
:
contrast
obtained
in
the
microscope
by
causing
light
scattered
by
small
particles
to
destructively
interfere
with
unscattered
light
,
thereby
enhancing
the
visibility
of
very
small
particles
and
particles
with
very
low
intrinsic
contrast
.
phase
contrast
microscope
:
a
microscope
configured
with
a
phase
mask
pair
to
create
phase
contrast
.
the
technique
which
uses
this
is
called
phase
contrast
microscopy
(
pcm
.
phasepolar
phase
polar
analysis
:
this
is
the
use
of
polarized
light
in
a
phase
contrast
microscope
.
it
is
used
to
see
the
same
size
fibers
that
are
visible
in
air
filter
analysis
.
although
fibers
finer
than
1
&
mum
are
visible
,
analysis
of
these
is
inferred
from
analysis
of
larger
bundles
that
are
usually
present
.
phasepolar
phase
polar
microscope
:
the
phasepolar
phase
polar
microscope
is
a
phase
contrast
microscope
which
has
an
analyzer
,
a
polarizer
,
a
first
order
red
plate
and
a
rotating
phase
condenser
all
in
place
so
that
the
polarized
light
image
is
enhanced
by
phase
contrast
.
sealing
encapsulant
:
this
is
a
product
which
can
be
applied
,
preferably
by
spraying
,
onto
an
asbestos
surface
which
will
seal
the
surface
so
that
fibers
cannot
be
released
.
serpentine
:
a
mineral
family
consisting
of
minerals
with
the
general
composition
mg
(
si2o
(
oh
)
having
the
magnesium
in
brucite
layer
over
a
silicate
layer
.
minerals
important
in
asbestos
analysis
included
in
this
family
are
chrysotile
,
lizardite
,
antigorite
.
