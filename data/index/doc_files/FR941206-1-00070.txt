the
work

this

as
a

the

a

,
which
was
involved
in
the
initial
discussions
concerning

considered
several
formats
in
developing
the

the

evaluated
by

included
a

a

for
the
reasons

a
format

a

the
epa
the
authority
to
promulgate

such
standards
are
necessary
in
cases
where
physically
measuring
emissions
from
a
source
is
impossible
or
at
least
impracticable
.
the
work
practices
that
were
selected
as
part
of
the
proposed
standards
are
practices
that
the
committee
agreed
are
feasible
but
for
which
emission
limits
could
not
be
assigned
.
for
this
source
category
,
work
practices
were
also
considered
necessary
for
another
reason
.
whereas
the
emission
limits
required
by
the

will
control
only
hap

from

,
the
work

will
limit
both
hap

.
several
committee
members
were
concerned
that
to
comply
with
the
proposed

,
sources
would
replace
hap

in
finishing
materials
with
equally
hazardous

implementing

all

the

recognized
that
by
implementing
work

standards
,
hap
emissions
from
finishing
and
gluing
operations
could
be
further
reduced
.
to
determine
the
work

that
would
be
technically
feasible
for
the

,
the
committee
established
a
work

the

group
comprised
the
epa
and
state
regulators
,
a
state
office
involved
with
waste

,

suppliers
,
manufacturers
,
and
an

the

work
group
identified
two
areas
in
which
hap
emissions
from

gluing
,

,
and
washoff
operations
could
be
reduced
through
work
practices
:
hap

and
two
more
areas
in
which
hap

could
be
reduced
from
finishing
operations
:
finishing
material
application
and
selection
of
finishing
materials
.
the
work
practices
proposed
by
the
work

group
were
discussed
with
the

a
consensus
was
reached
that
the
recommended
