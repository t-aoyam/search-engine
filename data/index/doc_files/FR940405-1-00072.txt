there
is
uncertainty
associated
with
the
quantification
of
any
kind
of
risk
.
in
this
risk
assessment
,
osha
has
tried
to
describe
many
of
the
sources
of
uncertainty
and
to
address
their
implications
for
oshas
estimates
of
risk
.
for
the
purpose
of
this
rulemaking
and
for
deriving
a
quantitative
estimate
of
occupational
risk
,
osha
has
concentrated
on
information
and
data
concerning
heart
disease
and
lung
cancer
as
potential
effects
associated
with
exposure
to
ets
.
b
.
review
of
epidemiologic
studies
and
published
risk
estimates
as
a
first
step
in
this
risk
assessment
,
osha
critically
reviewed
epidemiologic
studies
associating
exposure
to
ets
or
indoor
air
pollutants
with
adverse
health
effects
.
the
purpose
of
such
a
critical
evaluation
was
to
determine
whether
exposure
to
ets
is
a
causal
factor
in
cancer
and
heart
disease
and
whether
exposure
to
indoor
air
pollutants
has
caused
a
significant
increase
in
acute
irritant
effects
.
the
critical
review
also
enables
osha
to
select
those
studies
that
have
potential
for
use
in
a
quantitative
risk
assessment
.
tables

and
iv2
contain
a
summary
of
oshas
assessment
of
several
epidemiologic
studies
of
ets

individuals
.
osha
evaluated
studies
on
exposure
to
ets
to
determine
the
importance
and
weight
of
each
study
in
the
overall
hazard
identification
process

it
was
determined
that
fourteen
showed
a
statistically
strong
association
between

cancer
and

a
significant

concludes
that
the
relative
risk

in
nonsmokers
