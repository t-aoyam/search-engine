however
,
osha
does
not
believe
that
the
data
are
available
to
permit
osha
to
do
a
separate
risk
assessment
for
these
effects
which
would
in
a
major
way
add
to
the
present
assessment
.
the
risk
assessment
on
which
osha
has
based
its
significant
risk
determinations
for
the
1986
and
newly
revised
standards
,
calculated
the
incidence
of
mesothelioma
,
lung
and
other
cancers
and
asbestosis
,
diseases
based
on
a
substantial
amount
of
both
mortality
and
exposure
data
.
the
data
concerning
lung
function
decrement
and
pleural
plaques
lack
exposure
information
and
would
make
quantitative
risk
estimates
for
these
health
effects
less
precise
than
the
data
for
other
forms
of
asbestosrelated
asbestos
related
disease
upon
which
osha
is
relying
.
a
separate
risk
assessment
is
also
unnecessary
.
osha
believes
that
the
revised
regulations
are
already
regulating
at
the
margin
of
what
is
feasible
,
in
terms
of
levels
to
be
achieved
,
and
controls
which
are
required
.
osha
has
imposed
necessary
,
feasible
and
well
supported
work
practices
for
custodial
work
,
which
should
reduce
custodial
exposures
well
below
the
historic
levels
(
indeterminate
)
which
may
have
been
experienced
by
the
workers
studied
in
the
above
reports
.
more
generally
,
there
would
be
remaining
significant
risk
at
this
new
01
f
cc
exposure
limit
if
there
were
not
other
provisions
to
these
standards
.
however
,
the
exposure
limit
is
accompanied
by
mandated
work
practice
controls
and
requirements
for
hazard
communication
,
training
and
other
provisions
.
together
these
will
very
substantially
reduce
that
remaining
significant
risk
,
although
the
exact
amount
of
that
reduction
cannot
be
quantified
.
in
addition
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
measure
accurately
in
the
industrial
setting
levels
lower
than
those
in
these
standards
.
osha
believes
its
approach
of
setting
a
pel
which
is
reliably
measurable
,
yet
,
imposing
work
practices
and
ancillary
provisions
for
operations
regardless
of
measured
fiber
levels
will
result
in
risk
reduction
well
below
that
expected
from
just
enforcing
the
01
f
cc
pel
.
thus
,
a
lower
pel
would
not
produce
significant
worker
benefit
.

the
