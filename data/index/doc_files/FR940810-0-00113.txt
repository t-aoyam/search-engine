osha
believes
the
wickman
report
is
the
most
complete
study
available
concerning
custodial
exposures
.
because
the
study
was
submitted
into
the
record
after
the
close
of
the
posthearing
hearing
comment
periods
,
osha
is
not
relying
on
it
to
prove
the
extent
of
exposures
anticipated
in
most
custodial
work
.
rather
,
osha
views
the
wickman
study
as
confirming
its
view
that
class
iv
activities
result
in
reduced
exposure
and
thus
,
reduced
risk
compared
to
activities
of
other
classes
.
because
maintenance
work
involving
active
`
disturbances
'
is
class
iii
work
,
the
`
contact
'
with
acm
which
constitutes
class
iv
work
will
be
either
with
intact
materials
,
or
in
cleaningup
cleaning
debris
from
friable
material
or
from
material
which
has
been
disturbed
.
the
latter
activities
present
the
higher
risk
potential
.
osha
acknowledges
that
evidence
of
asbestos
disease
among
school
custodians
and
maintenance
workers
has
been
submitted
to
this
record
(
see
eg
,
references
cited
in
seius
post
hearing
brief
,
ex
.
144
.
the
agency
believes
that
significant
exposures
to
custodians
result
from
class
iii
work
or
when
they
clean
up
accumulations
of
friable
material
.
therefore
,
these
revisions
contain
several
requirements
aimed
at
reducing
custodial
exposures
when
cleaning
up
asbestos
debris
and
waste
material
.
osha
believes
that
the
work
practices
and
precautions
prescribed
in
these
regulations
will
virtually
eliminate
significant
health
risks
for
custodial
workers
,
and
will
cure
any
confusion
about
which
protections
and
which
standards
will
apply
to
custodial
worker

paragraph
(

of

requires
that

performed
by

trained
according
to
the
awareness
training
set
out
in
the
training
section

(

the

also

cleaning

in
a
regulated

where

are
required
to
be
worn
to
also
wear

this
restatement

relating
to

areas
emphasizes
that
cleanup

in

must
wear

protection
to

as
pointed
out
by

custodians
have
swept
up

had
fallen

this
new
provision
requires
that
`
employees

waste
and
debris

an
area
where

shall

high
risk

since
paragraph
(
k
)
requires
that
such

be
visibly
labelled
,
osha
believes
that
custodial
workers
will
be
spared
the
consequences
of
being
required
to
cleanup
clean
unidentified
materials
,
which
in
fact
contain
asbestos
