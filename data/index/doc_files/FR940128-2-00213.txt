as

,
the

quality

dated

did
not

consequently
,
on

,
the
licensees
authorized

signed
and
dated
a
written
directive
for
teletherapy
treatment
that
failed
to
include
the
overall
treatment
period
and
the
licensee
failed
to
verify
the
dose
calculations
,
since
the
treatment
called
for
less
than
3
fractions
,
to
ensure
the
final
plans
of

were
in

summary
of
licensees
response
to
the
violation
the
licensee
disputes
the
validity
of
the
cited
violation
,
the
assigned
severity
level
,
and
the
nrc
root
cause
analysis
,
as
follows
:
1
.
the
licensee
asserts
that
the
proposed
violation
did
not
cause
the
misadministration
even
though
the
written
directive
did
include
the
overall
treatment
period
.
in
the
written
directive
for
the
patient
treated
11/13/1992
,
the
number
of
fractions
is
written
as
`
2
fx
'
which
means
the
treatment
period
is
to
include
two
fractions
or
treatments
.
this
is
the
licensees
interpretation
of
the
overall
treatment
period
.
the
licensee
asserts
that
the
term
`
overall
treatment
period
'
is
not
defined
in
the
regulations
or
in
regulatory
guide
8
33
.
according
to
the
licensee
,
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
documentation
of
the
overall
treatment
period
would
have
no
bearing
on
the
initial
interpretational
error
made
by
the
dosimetrist
or
the
subsequent
oversights
by
individuals
who
were
verifying
the
correctness
of
the
treatment
.
2
.
the
licensee
notes
that
the
treatment
was
performed
on
an
emergency
basis
and
that
this
fact
causes
the
standard
verification
procedure
to
change
depending
upon
the
availability
of
staff
.
according
to
the
licensee
,
while
neither
the
quality
control
quality
assurance
program
(
qa
qcp
)
nor
the
quality
management
program
(
qmp
)
include
specific
procedures
for
verification
when
less
than
four
treatments
are
prescribed
,
no
change
in
the
subsequent
chart
checking
procedures
would
have
resulted
because
the
treatment
in
question
as
an
emergency
.
the
licensee
also
asserts
that
it
verified
the
dose
calculations
in
that
the
prescribing
physician
authorized
user
and
two
radiation
therapists
attempted
to
verify
that
the
treatment
to
be
delivered
was
in
accordance
with
the
written
directive
.
according
to
the
licensee
,
while
none
of
these
individuals
identified
the
calculational
error
made
by
the
dosimetrist
,
their
failure
to
identify
the
error
was
related
to
the
wording
of
the
written
directive
rather
than
the
failure
to
follow
proper
procedure
.
3
.
the
licensee
challenges
the
categorization
of
the
proposed
violation
as
a
severity
level
iii
violation
.
the
licensee
asserts
that
the
misadministration
occurred
due
to
inconsistencies
in
the
format
of
the
written
directive
,
and
that
the
qmp
was
followed
and
the
appropriate
checks
were
made
.
according
to
the
licensee
,
the
violation
would
be
more
appropriately
categorized
at
severity
level
iv
since
it
does
not
represent
a
programmatic
weakness
in
the
implementation
of
the
qmp
,
the
failure
was
isolated
to
the
single
event
,
and
the
consequences
were
limited
and
did
not
adversely
affect
the
patient
.
4
.
the
licensee
disagrees
with
the
nrcs
statement
that
,
`
the
violation
contributed
to
the
occurrence
of
a
misadministration
on
11/13/1992
'
nrc
evaluation
of
licensees
response
to
the
violation
this
enforcement
action
focuses
on
the
licensees
failure
to
develop
and
implement
an
adequate
qmp
.
as
a
result
of
the
misadministration
,
the
nrc
performed
a
detailed
review
of
the
licensees
qmp
during
the
followup
inspection
and
enforcement
deliberations
.
the
result
of
this
detailed
review
was
that
the
nrc
identified
substantial
deficiencies
.
the
inspection
determined
that
the
licensees
written
qmp
did
not
have
procedures
for
:
(
1
)
ensuring
that
the
written
directive
contained
the
total
dose
,
dose
per
fraction
,
treatment
site
,
and
the
overall
treatment
period
;
and
(
2
)
verifying
the
dose
calculations
for
administrations
of
three
fractions
or
less
to
confirm
that
the
final
plans
of
treatment
are
in
accordance
with
the
written
directive
.
the
licensee
has
not
provided
any
information
to
demonstrate
that
its
written
qmp
addressed
these
procedures
.
these
deficiencies
represent
a
programmatic
(
as
opposed
to
isolated
)
failure
in
the
implementation
of
the
qmp
;
therefore
,
the
violation
was
categorized
at
severity
level
iii
in
accordance
with
the
nrc
enforcement
policy
