initial
regulatory
flexibility
analysis
the
commission
has
prepared
an
initial
regulatory
flexibility
analysis
(
irfa
)
in
accordance
with
5
usc
.
603
regarding
proposed
rule
15c51
.
the
irfa
uses
certain
definitions
of
small
entities
adopted
by
the
commission
for
purposes
of
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
.
the
irfa
indicates
that
regulatory
action
is
required
in
order
to
ensure
that
market
makers
in
nasdaq
nms
securities
adhere
to
certain
minimum
standards
of
fair
treatment
of
customers
.
specifically
,
by
prohibiting
a
market
maker
from
trading
ahead
of
a
customer
limit
order
that
it
holds
,
the
rule
would
improve
the
quality
of
executions
for
customers
and
the
price
discovery
process
in
the
market
for
these
securities
.
in
1993
,
there
were
492
active
nasdaq
market
makers
.
30
data
on
the
number
of
market
makers
meeting
the
definition
of
small
entity
that
make
markets
in
nasdaq
nms
securities
and
execute
customer
limit
orders
is
unavailable
.
the
commission
is
unable
to
quantify
reasonably
the
impact
that
the
proposed
rule
would
have
on
small
market
makers
or
small
issuers
.
the
commission
does
not
believe
it
would
be
practicable
to
exempt
small
market
makers
from
the
proposed
rule
because
to
do
so
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
commissions
statutory
mandate
to
protect
investors
.

effects
on
competition
section
23a2
)
of
the
exchange
act
31
requires
the
commission
,
in
adopting
rules
under
the
act
,
to
consider
any
anticompetitive
competitive
effects
of
such
rules
and
to
balance
these
effects
against
the
regulatory
benefits
gained
in
furthering
the
purposes
of
the
act
.
as
previously
noted
,
comment
letters
received
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
nasd
interpretation
suggested
that
such
a
rule
would
deny
market
makers
an
opportunity
to
earn
a
profit
in
some
situations
.
if
true
,
this
may
result
in
less
market
maker
commitment
in
the
nasdaq
nms
market
which
may
in
turn
effect
competition
in
this
market
.
the
commission
is
soliciting
comment
on
the
effect
the
rule
may
have
on
market
maker
capital
commitment
and
small
issuers
.

the
commission
preliminarily
views
rule
15c51
as
causing
no
burden
on
competition
unnecessary
or
inappropriate
in
furtherance
of
the
purposes
of
the
exchange
act
.
the
commission
believes
that
the
principles
of
customer
protection
that
congress
envisioned
and
that
would
be
advanced
by
this
rule
justify
the
burdens
that
the
rule
will
impose
on
market
makers
.
the
commission
,
however
,
requests
comment
on
any
competitive
burdens
that
might
result
from
adoption
of
the
proposed
rule
described
in
this
release
.
