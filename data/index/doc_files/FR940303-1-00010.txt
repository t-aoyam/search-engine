be
noted
that
this
provision
is
violated
(
and
thus

for
departmental
discipline
exists
)
when
an
inappropriate
communication
takes
place
,
regardless
of

results
in
eliciting

exceptions
;
represented
parties
this
section
describes
the
circumstances
under
which
department
attorneys
may
communicate
,
or
cause
others
to
communicate
,
with
a
represented
party
who
the
department
attorney
knows
is
represented
concerning
the
subject
matter
of
the
representation
without
first
obtaining
the
consent
of
the
represented
partys
counsel
.
the
exceptions
enumerated
in
this
section
are
similar
to
,
but
not
identical
with
,
the
exceptions
enumerated
in
§
777
of
the
earlier
proposal
.
paragraph
(
a
:
determination
if
representation
exists
this
exception
recognizes
the
fact
that
there
is
no
reason
to
prohibit
a
limited
inquiry
about
whether
an
individual
is
,
in
fact
,
represented
by
counsel
regarding
the
relevant
subject
matter
.
such
an
inquiry
does
not
involve
the
kind
of
communication
about
which
courts
have
expressed
concern
and
has
little
potential
for
undermining
the
attorneyclient
attorney
client
relationship
.
there
may
be
uncertainty
about
the
existence
of
representation
with
respect
to
whether
it
has
been
established
,
whether
it
may
have
been
terminated
,
and
whether
a
particular
subject
falls
within
the
scope
of
the
representation
.
the
first
issue
may
arise
when
a
judicial
or
other
appearance
has
not
occurred
,
but
the
government
attorney
has
some
information
suggesting
that
the
person
may
be
represented
.
it
may
also
arise
when
an
attorney
purports
to
represent
a
group
of
persons
,
such
as
all
the
employees
of
a
corporation
.
uncertainty
about
the
termination
of
the
representation
may
arise
when
substantial
time
has
passed
since
it
was
made
known
that
the
person
was
represented
by
counsel
or
when
the
attorney
for
the
government
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
representation
has
ceased
.
it
is
unlikely
,
however
,
that
such
uncertainty
will
arise
when
there
are
pending
judicial
proceedings
,
since
the
court
must
approve
termination
of
representation
.
when
inquiring
about
the
status
of
representation
,
government
attorneys
and
agents
generally
must
refrain
from
stating
whether
it
is
necessary
or
desirable
to
be
represented
by
counsel
.
after
the
right
to
counsel
has
attached
,
a
statement
or
implication
suggesting
that
counsel
is
not
providing
proper
or
effective
representation
could
violate
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
.

this

and
does
not

a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
for
the

to
inquire
about
the
status
of

initiation
of
communication
by
represented
party
one
of
the
concerns
most
frequently
raised
by
department
attorneys
during
the
comment
period
on
the
previous
proposal
was
the
lack
of
clarity
under
current
law
regarding
the
propriety
of
communicating
with
a
represented
party
,
in
the
absence
of
that
partys
counsel
,
when
the
communication
is
initiated
by
the
party
.
a
defendant
may
wish
to
communicate
with
the
government
outside
the
presence
of
counsel
for
many
valid
reasons
.
department
attorneys
repeatedly
cited
the
situation
in
which
a
defendant
wants
to
cooperate
with
the
government
but
does
not
want
his
or
her
attorney
to
know
for
fear
that
the
attorney
will
disclose
the
defendants
intentions
to
others
.
this
situation
typically
arises
when
the
defendant
questions
the
loyalty
of
his
or
her
attorney
,
who
is
being
paid
by
another
individual
involved
in
a
criminal
enterprise
.
the
same
problem
may
arise
when
a
single
attorney
represents
multiple
parties
who
are
part
of
the
same
criminal
enterprise
.
when
the
desire
of
a
defendant
or
arrestee
to
speak
with
the
attorney
for
the
government
outside
the
presence
of
his
or
her
counsel
is
`
voluntary
,
knowing
and
informed
'
there
is
no
valid
reason
to
prohibit
the
government
from
engaging
in
such
communications
.
in
fact
,
the
department
believes
that
it
would
be
a
dereliction
of
its
obligation
to
enforce
vigorously
federal
law
if
it
promulgated
a
rule
that
would
prohibit
such
communications
.
it
is
well
established
that
an
individual
who
is
entitled
to
counsel
under
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
sixth
amendment
may
waive
that
right
and
choose
to
communicate
with
the
government
outside
the
presence
of
his
or
her
attorney
,
`
provided
the
waiver
is
made
voluntarily

knowingly
