appendix
a
the
family
of
graphics
standards
the
following
computer
graphics
standards
are
now
available
to
address
the
needs
of
government
applications
in
creating
,
modifying
,
manipulating
,
and
exchanging

in
addition
,
the
computer
graphics
interface
(
cgi
)
has
recently
become
an
international
standard
,
and
is
expected
to
be
issued
as
a
fips
.
these
standards
fall
into
two
categories
:
application
programmers
interface
(
api
)
standards
,
and
interoperability
standards
.
the
goal
of
api
standards
is
to
enhance
the
portability
of
graphics
programs
(
and
programmers
)
between
installations
and
environments
.
the
goal
of
interoperability
standards
is
to
enable
graphics
data
to
be
exchanged
successfully
between
graphics
systems
and
devices
.
figure
1
is
a
very
simple
reference
model
of
a
computer
graphics
operating
environment
.
the
model
emphasizes
that
a
graphics
application
program
interacts
with
physical
devices
and
human
operators
via
a
computer
graphics
environment
.
figure
1
also
shows
that
the
application
may
receive
information
from
an
external
database
.
the
output
of
the
graphics
program
,
as
shown
in
figure
1
,
is
directed
to
a
virtual
graphics
device
(
ie
,
virtual
device
interface
or
vdi
)
rather
than
directly
to
a
physical
device
.
a
device
driver
provides
an
interface
,
implemented
in
either
hardware
or
software
,
for
translating
virtual
device
commands
to
commands
understood
by
a
particular
physical
device
.
by
substituting
one
device
driver
for
another
,
an
application
can
run
on
a
different
physical
device
.
this
device
independent
is
a
central
concept
of
this
graphics
reference
model
.
in
figure
1
,
the
api
standards
reside
in
the
box
labelled
the
device
independent
graphics
package
.
interoperability
standards
are
related
to
the
boxes
in
figure
labelled
metafile
,
database
and
virtual
device
interface
.
figure
2
depicts
the
various
graphics
standards
associated
with
the
general
model
shown
in
figure

.
