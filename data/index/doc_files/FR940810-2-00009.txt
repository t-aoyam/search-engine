analysis
we
received
only
one
questionnaire
response
,
and
that
was
from
laperle
.
based
on
our
analysis
of
laperles
response
,
we
have
determined
that
laperle
is
related
to
other
manufacturers

for
which
it

laperle
and
its
related
entities
meet
all
five
criteria
,
in
addition
to
ownership
,
that
the
department
considers
in
determining
whether

(

.
the
five
criteria
,
in
addition
to
ownership
,
are
as
follows
:
&
bullwhether
companies
have
interlocking
boards
of
directors
&
bullwhether
companies
have
similar
production
processes
,
facilities
or
equipment
so
as
to
facilitate
shifting
of
production
between
facilities
&
bullwhether
companies
operate
as
separate
and
distinct
entities
&
bullwhether
companies
share
marketing
and
sales
information
or
offices
&
bullwhether
companies
are
involved
in
the
pricing
or
production
decisions
of
the
other
entity
based
on
our
analysis
of
these
criteria
,
the
information
on
the
record
indicates
that
13
other
companies
,
in
addition
to
those
included
in
the
notice
of
initiation
of
administrative
review
,
are
sufficiently
related
to
be
collapsed
.
it
is
our
preliminary
determination
laperle
and
all
its
related
companies
should
be
treated
as
a
single
entity
.
(
for
more
information
see
the
analysis
memorandum
for
the
preliminary
results
)
therefore
,
in
effect
,
we
are
now
conducting
a
review
of
one
single
company
,
comprised
of
various
individual
components
,
including
laperle
.
