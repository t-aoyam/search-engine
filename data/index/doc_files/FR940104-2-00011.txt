after
a
review
of
alternatives
analyzed
in
the
ea
,
the
council
selected
alternative
3
as
the
preferred
alternative
.
this
alternative
is
projected
in
modeling
simulations
to
rebuild
pop
biomass
to
a
target
level
(
b
msy
)
)
in
about
14
years
by
harvesting
pop
at
a
fishing
mortality
rate
lower
than
the
optimum
rate
.
the
target
biomass
b
msy
is
the
total
biomass
of
mature
females
that
would
produce
the
maximum
sustainable
yield
,
on
average
;
this
number
is
currently
estimated
at
150000
mt
.
the
optimal
fishing
mortality
rate
is
the
rate
that
maximizes
expected
biological
and
economic
yields
over
a
range
of
plausible
stockrecruitment
stock
recruitment
relationships
.
the
council
considered
alternative
3
superior
to
alternative
1
,
which
no
longer
represents
the
best
scientific
information
about
pop
biomass
and
population
dynamics
.
the
council
also
considered
alternative
3
superior
to
alternative
2
,
which
would
harvest
pop
at
the
higher
optimal
fishing
mortality
rate
.
the
council
believed
that
lower
pop
harvests
and
additional
economic
costs
of
alternative
3
were
justified
because
alternative
2
would
achieve
the
target
biomass
in
a
longer
time
(
about
18
years
)
and
with
a
lower
probability
of
rebuilding
success
.
alternative
4
would
harvest
pop
at
a
lower
rate
equivalent
needed
for
unavoidable
pop
bycatch
in
remaining
groundfish
fisheries
,
at
1992
bycatch
rates
.
the
tacs
resulting
from
alternative
4
were
considered
too
restrictive
in
relation
to
existing
pop
bycatch
needs
,
causing
unnecessary
discards
of
pop
that
are
killed
in
fishing
operations
after
pop
tacs
are
reached
.
under
alternative
3
,
the
fmp
would
establish
the
procedure
for
deriving
the
annual
goa
tacs
for
pop
.
pop
stocks
are
considered
to
be
rebuilt
when
the
total
biomass
of
mature
females
is
equal
to
,
or
greater
than
,
b
msy
.
.
annual
tacs
would
be
established
as
follows
:
(
a
)
determine
the
current
biomass
,
b
msy
,
,
and
the
optimal
fishing
mortality
rate
;
(
b
)
determine
the
fishing
mortality
rate
halfway
between
the
optimal
fishing
mortality
rate
and
the
fishing
mortality
rate
estimated
to
be
sufficient
to
supply
unavoidable
bycatch
of
pop
based
on
1992
bycatch
rates
;
(
c
)
when
the
current
biomass
of
mature
females
is
less
than
b
msy
,
,
adjust
the
resultant
fishing
mortality
rate
in
(
b
)
by
the
ratio
of
current
biomass
to
b
msy
so
that
when
b
msy
is
attained
,
the
fishing
mortality
rate
will
be
the
optimal
fishing
mortality
rate
;
(
d
)
the
goa
tac
of
pop
is
the
amount
of
fish
resulting
from
the
adjusted
fishing
mortality
rate
in
(
c
;
and
(
e
)
the
tac
is
apportioned
among
regulatory
areas
in
proportion
to
pop
biomass
distribution
.
in
addition
to
restricting
the
annual
fishing
mortality
rate
of
pop
,
the
council
seeks
to
reduce
the
total
mortality
of
pop
in
other
target
fisheries
.
in
the
past
,
overfishing
has
been
defined
goawide
goa
wide
.
under
amendment
32
,
the
overfishing
level
would
be
distributed
among
the
eastern
,
central
,
and
western
areas
in
the
same
proportions
as
pop
biomass
occurs
in
those
areas
.
this
measure
would
avoid
localized
depletion
of
pop
and
would
rebuild
pop
at
equal
rates
in
all
regulatory
areas
of
the
goa
.
the
council
considers
this
management
option
necessary
because
,
although
pop
biomass
is
greatest
in
the
eastern
regulatory
area
,
most
trawl
fishing
activity
and
incidental
catch
of
pop
is
greatest
in
the
central
regulatory
area
.
with
an
acceptable
biological
catch
as
low
as
the
current
,
3378
mt
in
1993
,
fishing
mortality
of
pop
can
be
expected
to
exceed
the
tac
available
in
the
central
goa
.
amendment
32
is
necessary
to
improve
conservation
and
management
of
pop
and
is
intended
to
further
the
goals
and
objectives
of
the
fmp
.
no
regulatory
changes
are
necessary
to
implement
this
fmp
amendment
because
the
fmp
would
provide
the
procedure
for
deriving
tacs
for
pop
,
which
are
specified
annually
under
existing
regulations

§
672
