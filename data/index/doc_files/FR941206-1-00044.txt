using
various
forums
,
the
committee
discussed
many
challenging
issues
such
as
subcategorizing
the
source
category
,
the
emission
data
to
be
used
to
select
the
standards
,
potential
regulatory
formats
,
emission
limits
,
work
practice
standards
,
compliance
determination
techniques
,
enforcement
,
and
reporting
and
recordkeeping
.
other
issues
such
as
the
impacts
of
the
rule
on
small
businesses
,
the
relationship
between
the
proposed
rule
and
the
title
v
operating
permit
program
,
and
the
effects
of
foreign
competition
were
also
considered
.
given
the
potential
for
compliance
with
the
rule
by
substituting
nonhap
hap
compounds
for
hap
contained
in
the
coatings
(
eg
,
ethanol
for
methanol
,
the
issue
of
substitution
of
nonhap
hap
vocs
for
hap
was
discussed
at
great
length
.
another
major
concern
was
the
possibility
of
substituting
a
more
toxic
hap
for
another
hap
.
this
concern
prompted
a
discussion
on
the
relative
toxicity
of
compounds
used
in
wood
furniture
manufacturing
.
at
the
final
negotiating
session
of
the
full
committee
,
many
of
the
major
issues
were
resolved
conceptually
.
thereafter
,
the
committee
reviewed
drafts
of
the
regulatory
language
and
the
preamble
and
held
conference
calls
and
informal
working
group
meetings
to
resolve
the
remaining
issues
.
some
committee
members
feel
that
because
the
proposed
standards
were
developed
solely
for
this
source
category
and
many
of
the
provisions
were
developed
through
a
regulatory
negotiation
process
,
which
often
requires
concessions
from
some
parties
in
exchange
for
concessions
from
other
parties
in
other
areas
,
these
proposed
standards
should
not
be
used
as
a
basis
for
the
development
of
standards
for
other
source
categories
.
the
emission
limitations
for
adhesives
were
developed
by
the
epa
outside
of
the
regulatory
negotiation
process
,
because
adhesive
suppliers
were
not
represented
on
the
committee
.
while
a
glue
work
group
was
formed
to
address
gluing
operations
,
the
committee
members
decided
to
suspend
the
work
so
they
could
focus
their
efforts
on
finishing
,
cleaning
,
and
washoff
operations
.

the
following
paragraphs
briefly
describe
the
operations
covered
by
the
proposed
standards
for
the
wood
furniture
(
surface
coating
)
source
category
.
the
epa
has
produced
a
draft
of
chapters
1
through
4
of
the
ctg
.
these
chapters
provide
a
detailed
process
description
for
the
many
types
of
wood
furniture
operations
in
this
source
category
.
interested
parties
can
refer
to
the
draft
chapters
,
which
may
be
found
in
the
docket
of
materials
supporting
this
proposed
rule
,
for
a
more
detailed
description
than
that
provided
here
.
the
wood
furniture
industry
encompasses
the
manufacture
of
many
diverse
products
.
for
the
purposes
of
the
proposed
rule
,
the
wood
furniture
(
surface
coating
)
category
includes
production
of
the
following
products
and
their
components
:
1
.
wood
kitchen
cabinets
;
2
.
wood
residential
furniture
;
3
.
upholstered
residential
and
office
furniture
;
4
.
wood
television
,
radio
,
phonograph
,
and
sewing
machine
cabinets
;
5
.
wood
office
furniture
and
fixtures
;
6
.
partitions
,
shelving
,
and
lockers
;
and
7
.
other
wood
furniture
not
described
by
one
of
the
above
categories
.
despite
the
broad
range
of
products
manufactured
by
this
source
category
,
some
manufacturing
operations
are
common
.
there
are
four
basic
wood
furniture
manufacturing
operations
that
are
included
in
the
affected
emission
source
subject
to
the
proposed
rule
.
these
are
finishing
,
gluing
,
cleaning
,
and
washoff
.
wood
furniture
finishing
operations
include
those
operations
in
which
a
finishing
material
is
applied
to
a
substrate
.
finishing
processes
differ
within
the
industry
,
but
typically
they
consist
of
application
of
finishing
materials
,
evaporation
of
volatiles
,
and
curing
of
the
piece
in
an
oven
.
facilities
may
finish
the
furniture
in
components
and
then
assemble
it
,
but
more
commonly
,
the
piece
of
furniture
is
assembled
and
then
finished
.
the
furniture
or
furniture
components
may
be
moved
manually
from
one
finishing
application
station
to
the
next
,
or
may
be
on
tow
lines
that
automatically
move
through
the
finishing
lines
.
