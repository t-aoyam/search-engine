the

(

)
has
been
revised
to
include
a
procedure
that
could
be
applied
to
mechanically
separated
product
made
in
part
from
mature
chickens
.
that
procedure
involves
a
determination
of
the
relative
mature

young
chicken
proportions
when

is
made
from
a
combination
of
young
and
mature
chickens

bone
particle
size
.
fsis
is
proposing
that
at
least
98
percent
of
the
bone
particles
present
in
msk
)
be
restricted
to
a
maximum
size
no
greater
than
15
millimeter
(
mm
)
in
their
greatest
dimension
and
no
bone
particles
shall
be
larger
than
2
millimeter
in
their
greatest
dimension
.
the
need
to
limit
the
size
of
bone
particles
in
msk
)
has
been
acknowledged
since
the
poultry
industry
began
to
use
mechanical
methods
for
manufacturing
this
product
.
fsis
'
objective
is
that
the
limitation
imposed
be
adequate
to
prevent
any
digestibility
problems
while
not
restricting
the
operation
of
equipment
in
accordance
with
good
manufacturing
practices
more
than
is
necessary
for
this
purpose
or
to
protect
finished
product
quality
.
in
the
1979
health
and
safety
report
,
it
was
recommended
that
bone
particle
size
be
controlled
to
ensure
that
equipment
type
or
processing
does
not
result
in
unacceptably
large
fragments
.
the
report
concluded
that
,
provided
this
is
done
,
the
bone
particles
in
the
product
will
not
present
any
health
hazard
because
of
size
or
hardness
.

recordkeeping
.
fsis
is
also
proposing
that
establishments
that
manufacture
msk
)
maintain
records
of
bone
solids
content
and
bone
particle
size
as
a
measure
of
process
control
.
these
records
must
be
made
available
to
the
inspector
and
any
other
duly
authorized
representative
of
the
secretary
upon
request
.

limitations
on
use
fsis
is
proposing
certain
limitations
with
respect
to
the
use
of
msk
)
in
the
formulation
of
poultry
and
meat
food
products
.
fsis
is
proposing
such
restrictions
based
on
the
potential
fluoride
contribution
of
msk
)
made
from
fowl
(
ie
,
mature
female
chickens
)
and
the
characteristics
of
msk
,
including
the
kind
of
poultry
from
which
it
is
made
and
its
consistency
.
fsis
believes
that
such
requirements
are
necessary
to
prevent
potential
health
and
safety
problems
,
and
to
maintain
the
quality
and
integrity
of
the
poultry
and
meat
food
product
supply
.
fsis
is
also
proposing
that
msk
)
may
be
used
,
except
in
certain
cases
,
in
any
product
defined
by
regulatory
standards
or
agency
policies
whereby
`

or

are
being
used

that
it
is

kind
of
product
limitation
.
fsis
is
proposing
that
when
a
poultry
product
is
required
to
be
prepared
from
a
particular
kind
or
kinds
of
poultry
(
eg
,
chickens
,
use
of
msk
)
of
any
other
kind
(
eg
,
mechanically
separated
turkey
)
would
not
be
permitted
.
this
provision
would
assure
that
msk
)
made
from
a
different
kind
of
poultry
is
not
used
in
a
poultry
product
represented
as
containing
ingredients
from
a
particular
kind
or
kinds
of
poultry
.
the
proposed
definition
and
standard
for
msk
)
covers
msk
)
prepared
from
any
kind
of
poultry
.
fsis
would
not
permit
use
of
msk
)
as
an
ingredient
in
any
given
poultry
product
regardless
of
the
kind
of
poultry
from
which
it
is
made
.
such
action
would
be
inconsistent
with
existing
regulatory
requirements
and
could
,
among
other
things
,
result
in
false
or
misleading
labeling
.
for
example
,
the
definition
and
standard
for
`
kind
)
patties
'
(
9
cfr
381
160
)
requires
that
poultry
product
ingredients
be
`
of
the
kind
indicated
'
(
eg
,
turkey
products
in
turkey
patties
.
fsis
believes
that
proposing
to
provide
for
the
use
of
msk
)
as
a
distinctive
poultry
product
ingredient
should
not
abrogate
this
requirement
(
eg
,
to
not
permit
use
of
mechanically
separated
chicken
in
turkey
patties
.

limitations
on
product
made
from
fowl
.
fsis
is
proposing
that
the
use
of
mechanically
separated
chicken
made
,
in
whole
or
in
part
,
from
fowl
(
ie
,
mature
female
chickens
,
as
defined
in
9
cfr
381
170
)
not
be
permitted
in
baby
,
junior
,
or
toddler
foods
.
these
restrictions
are
based
on
the
potential
fluoride
contribution
of
product
made
from
fowl
to
dietary
intakes
.
the
1979
health
and
safety
report
found
only
slight
differences
between
the
fluoride
content
of
msk
)
made
from
poultry
other
than
fowl
and
that
of
poultry
products
produced
by
traditional
deboning
techniques
,
but
considerably
higher
amounts
in
msk
)
made
from
fowl
.
