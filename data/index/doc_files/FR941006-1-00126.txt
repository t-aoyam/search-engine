based
on
the
data
in
the
aapcc
and
ag
petitions
and
in
the
cpsc
case
reports
,
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
can
cause
injury
,
including
serious
injury
,
and
death
when
children
gain
access
to
these
products
.
fda
finds
from
these
data
that
the
potential
for
harm
exists
for
all
three
types
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
available
,
ie
,
multivitamin/mineral
vitamin/mineral
supplements
that
contain
iron
,
iron
supplements
,
and
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drugs
.
supporting
this
finding
are
the
data
cited
in
tables
1
,
2
,
and
3
that
show
that
,
since
1983
,
at
least
40
deaths
have
been
attributed
to
the
accidental
ingestion
of
iron
supplements
and
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drugs
,
and
that
,
since
1986
,
nearly
190
poisonings
that
were
life
threatening
or
that
resulted
in
permanent
injury
,
and
over
2000
poisonings
requiring
some
form
of
treatment
,
have
resulted
from
accidental
ingestion
of
adult
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
further
support
is
provided
by
the
data
in
the
cpsc
case
reports
,
which
show
80
ingestions
of
iron
leading
to
hospital
emergency
room
visits
with
varying
types
of
injury
,
including
vomiting
,
lethargy
,
diarrhea
,
and
elevated
serum
iron
(
see
table
6
.
the
data
in
tables
4
and
6
show
that
in
several
documented
poisoning
incidents
,
children
have
ingested
30
,
40
,
50
,
or
more
tablets
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
when
these
amounts
of
tablets
were
accessible
.
aside
from
the
potential
for
such
ingestion
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
supplements
and
drugs
to
be
fatal
,
the
consequences
of
ingesting
even
multivitamin/mineral
vitamin/mineral
type
products
in
these
amounts
is
evident
from
table
8
.
this
table
shows
that
an
amount
of
iron
that
may
produce
symptoms
of
iron
poisoning
(
ie
,
25
mg
kg
)
can
be
ingested
by
a
10
kg
child
if
the
child
consumes
25
tablets
containing
10
mg
of
iron
each
or
approximately
14
tablets
containing
18
mg
each
.
(
ten
mg
and
18
mg
of
iron
are
the
amounts
typically
contained
in
multivitamin/mineral
vitamin/mineral
supplements
with
iron
including
childrens
vitamins
)
based
upon
the
data
in
tables
4
and
6
,
ingestion
of
this
many
tablets
is
not
atypical
.
thus
,
fda
finds
that
injury
can
result
anytime
a
small
child
is
able
to
gain
access
to
even
the
lowest
potency
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
available
.
further
,
the
fact
that
over
2000
reported
poisoning
incidents
of
varying
severity
have
been
recorded
in
recent
years
(
tables
2
and
3
,
and
the
fact
that
aapcc
reports
that
accidental
iron
poisoning
is
presently
the
leading
cause
of
pediatric
poisoning
deaths
,
lead
fda
to
find
that
pediatric
iron
poisonings
have
occurred
,
and
continue
to
occur
,
with
significant
frequency
.
further
,
fda
finds
that
the
fact
that
these
poisonings
continue
to
occur
,
even
though
there
have
been
over
40
deaths
from
accidental
iron
ingestion
(
see
table
1
,
strongly
suggests
that
many
adults
are
not
aware
of
the
potential
for
serious
harm
or
death
in
young
children
from
accidental
ingestion
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
support
for
this
finding
is
provided
by
statements
made
by
the
parents
of
the
victims
in
several
of
the
poisoning
incidents
,
described
in
the
case
reports
obtained
from
cpsc
as
follows
:
(

)
`
the
mother
stated
that
she
thought
the
pills
(
prenatal
iron
pills
)
were
just
vitamins
and
would
not
harm
the
victim
