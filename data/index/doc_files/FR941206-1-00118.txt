referenced
the
specific
subjects
of
requirements
analysis
and
analysis
of
alternatives
in
the

guide
series
.
the

(

subpart
201201
is
revised
to
clarify
gsas
intent
regarding
the
preparation
of
requirements
analyses
.
currently
,
the
firmr
requires
agencies
to
document
their
requirements
for
fip
resources
`
by
conducting
a
requirements
analysis
commensurate
with
the
size
and
complexity
of
the
need
'
some
agencies
have
questioned
the
necessity
of
conducting
a
requirements
analysis
and
preparing
the
required
documentation
when
a
similar
document
has
already
been
prepared
in
conformance
with
agency
programmatic
needs
.
the
firmr
is
being
revised
to
allow
agencies
to
use
such
similar
documents
if
they
address
the
basic
information
required
in
a
requirements
analysis
.
other
agencies
have
misinterpreted
the
intent
of
the
phrase
`
commensurate
with
the
size
and
complexity
of
the
need
'
and
,
in
some
cases
,
are
over
documenting
requirements
for
small
dollar
acquisitions
.
these
small
dollar
acquisitions
are
usually
for
commercial
items
readily
available
in
the
competitive
marketplace
.
far
planning
provisions
and
agencies
'
local
procurement
practices
provide
sufficient
information
for
requirements
to
justify
small
dollar
value
acquisitions
.
to
ensure
more
expeditious
and
efficient
acquisitions
,
this
rule
establishes
a
threshold
for
when
agencies
must
conduct
requirements
analyses
and
analyses
of
alternatives
.
sections
20120
102
and
20120
202
are
revised
to
eliminate
the
requirement
to
perform
requirements
analyses
and
analyses
of
alternatives
for
acquisitions
of
fip
resources
when
the
total
estimated
system
life
costs
are
less
than
$
100000
.
additionally
,
§
20120
103
is
revised
to
require
that
agencies
only
consider
the
factors
in
this
section
if
it
is
appropriate
to
do
so
.
this
allows
agencies
to
exercise
discretion
regarding
whether
or
not
to
include
the
factors
in
their
requirements
analyses
.
