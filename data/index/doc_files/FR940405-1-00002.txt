supplementary
information
:
the
proposed
rule
was
issued
as
amendments
to
regulations
governing
cotton
classification
services
for
producers
(

cfr
part
28
.
the
proposal
was
issued
on
01/31/1994
,
and
published
in
the
federal
register
(
59
fr
4257
.
it
proposed
the
implementation
of
module
averaging
,
a
method
by
which
the
accuracy
of
fiber
quality
measurements
can
be
improved
.
the
module
averaging
procedure
would
use
all
the
bales
from
a
module
or
trailer
as
the
testing
unit
rather
than
using
a
single
bale
as
the
test
unit
.
the
module
averaging
procedure
has
been
offered
to
growers
on
a
voluntary
basis
for
the
past
three
crop
years
.
the
secretary
of
agricultures
advisory
committee
on
cotton
marketing
recommended
that
if
no
significant
problems
were
encountered
during
the
1993
classing
season
,
the
module
averaging
procedure
be
expanded
to
include
all
cotton
classed
in
1994
and
subsequent
crop
years
.
for
the
1993
expanded
voluntary
program
,
there
were
242
gins
participating
and
the
production
from
these
gins
totaled
3053716
bales
.
this
represented
20
percent
of
the
1993
cotton
crop
.
no
problems
of
any
significance
are
known
to
have
developed
during
the
1993
project
.
in
keeping
with
the
advisory
committees
recommendation
,
ams
proposed
that
module
averaging
be
applied
to
all
bales
classed
effective
with
the
1994
cotton
crop
.
written
comments
regarding
this
proposal
were
accepted
from
01/31/1994
,
through
03/02/1994
.
comments
were
received
from
individuals
and
organizations
representing
several
segments
of
the
cotton
industry
including
producers
,
ginners
,
warehousers
,
merchants
,
cooperatives
,
national
and
international
trade
associations
,
textile
manufacturers
,
and
others
.
this
broad
cross
section
of
the
cotton
industry
,
together
with
a
significant
number
of
comments
(
61
)
indicates
a
strong
interest
in
the
module
averaging
concept
throughout
the
industry
.
the
textile
manufacturing
segment
submitted
four
comments
;
one
from
a
national
organization
representing
domestic
textile
manufacturers
,
and
three
from
individual
firms
.
all
of
these
comments
expressed
support
for
the
proposal
.
the
national
organization
representing
textile
manufacturers
favored
the
implementation
of
the
proposal
provided
four
conditions
were
met
:
(
1
)
that
at
least
two
tests
per
bale
be
made
;
(
2
)
that
the
integrity
of
the
module
be
maintained
by
preventing
the
intermingling
of
cotton
between
module
test
units
;
(
3
)
that
when
the
module
averaging
procedure
is
used
only
those
measurements
that
fall
within
three
standard
deviations
of
the
average
be
included
in
the
module
average
;
and
(
4
)
that
for
the
purposes
of
review
classification
,
all
bales
from
the
module
be
retested
.
the
remaining
three
comments
all
reiterated
the
suggestion
for
the
use
of
three
standard
deviations
as
a
determination
for
including
bales
in
the
module
average
.
the
agency
is
currently
,
and
will
continue
,
studying
how
best
to
determine
the
inclusion
or
exclusion
of
bales
from
the
module
average
.
thirteen
comments
were
received
from
the
producer
segment
,
including
two
from
national
organizations
.
one
national
organization
was
in
favor
of
the
proposal
.
the
other
recommended
the
delay
of
mandatory
implementation
until
1995
,
and
the
application
of
module
averaging
to
length
,
strength
and
micronaire
measurements
only
.
the
remaining
comments
,
submitted
by
regional
producer
organizations
and
individual
producers
,
were
nearly
equally
divided
among
those
favoring
the
proposal
and
those
supporting
the
module
averaging
concept
,
but
suggesting
the
continuation
of
the
voluntary
program
.
the
cotton
ginning
segment
,
through
national
and
state
organizations
,
and
individual
ginners
,
submitted
14
written
comments
.
the
national
organization
representing
cotton
ginners
encouraged
the
comprehensive
industry
review
of
the
1993
and
1994
module
averaging
results
and
continuation
of
the
voluntary
module
averaging
program
.
the
remaining
comments
expressed
general
support
for
the
module
averaging
concept
but
suggested
that
module
averaging
be
continued
on
a
voluntary
basis
.
a
leading
national
association
representing
cotton
merchants
,
shippers
and
exporters
of
raw
cotton
opposed
the
mandatory
implementation
of
module
averaging
while
supporting
the
continuation
of
the
voluntary
program
.
the
agency
is
currently
responding
to
a
separate
request
from
this
organization
for
statistical
data
pertaining
to
module
averaged
cotton
.
this
organization
maintains
that
further
evaluation
of
the
data
is
necessary
prior
to
the
implementation
of
mandatory
module
averaging
.
the
remaining
22
comments
received
from
the
merchant
segment
also
requested
that
module
averaging
be
continued
on
a
voluntary
basis
so
that
the
effects
of
module
averaging
on
cotton
marketing
can
be
further
evaluated
.
three
foreign
cotton
trade
organizations
submitted
comments
.
these
comments
all
stated
that
the
international
cotton
trade
was
not
yet
sufficiently
knowledgeable
about
the
module
averaging
concept
to
favor
its
use
on
anything
more
than
a
voluntary
basis
.
in
light
of
the
views
expressed
in
comments
submitted
from
the
various
segments
of
the
cotton
industry
,
the
agency
has
determined
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
continue
with
the
module
averaging
program
on
a
voluntary
basis
.
such
action
will
provide
the
cotton
industry
more
time
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
module
averaging
on
cotton
marketing
.
accordingly
,
the
proposed
rule
is
withdrawn
effective
04/05/1994
.
