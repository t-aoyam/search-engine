facility
owner

to
demonstrate

that

the
criteria
,
specified
in

are
similar
to
the
inspection
protocols
for

such
as
sampling

analysis

inspector

considered
allowing
the
use

information
in

possession
relating

specifications
to
rebut
the
presumption
.
however
,
many
who
made
submissions
during
the
supplementary
comment
period
,
pointed
out
to
the
agency
that
building
records
were
rarely
adequate
to
convincingly
establish
the
absence
of

in
buildings
and
recommended
that
they
should
not
be
used
for
rebutting

some
felt
that
building

might
be
useful
in
confirming

not
rebutting

the

,
while
others
deemed
the
only
reliable

an

thus

such

to
appear
on
building

if
they
had
contained

(

in

the
numerous
comments
on

most
of
which
affirmed
the
general
inadequacy
of

to
rebut

the

suggested
that
notice

take
place
early
in
the
contracting
process
(

and
a
representative
of

gas
association
agreed
that
prebid

notification
of
contractors
was
needed
(

osha
agrees

requiring
notification
to
prospective
contractors
at
bid
time
will
improve
employee
protection
.
knowledge
about
asbestos
presence
gained
after
bidding
may
cause
the
bidder
to
dilute
protection
in

to
salvage
the

.
contractors
may
lose
time
and
money
if
they
conscientiously
stop
a
job
when
asbestos
is
discovered

other

echoed

notifying

also
recommended
(

the
standard
provides
that
notification
may
be
either
in
writing
or
via
a
personal
communication
between
the
owner
and
persons
owed
notification
or
their
authorized
representatives
.
osha
expects
that
in
the
case
of

,
notifications
will
be
included
in
the

documents

in

cases
it
may

otherwise
communicated

osha
believes
these
notifications
,
supplemented
by
clarified
labeling
requirements
