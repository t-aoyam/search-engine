to

the

also

address
all

following

reorganization
,
the
faa
official
who
makes
such

now
is
the
assistant

the
faa
proposes
to
amend
part

accordingly

in

the
deputy

aviation
security

and
any
individual
formally
designated
to
act
in
the
capacity
of

would
have
authority

we

detail
the
extent

which
the
assistant

may
further
delegate

for

we
propose

permit
delegation

the
information
that
is

welldefined

section
1917j
)
provides
a
`
catch
all
'
basis
for
determining
that
other
information
is
sensitive
security
information
.
a
decision
to
release
or
withhold
information
under
§
1917j
)
requires
a
careful
evaluation
of
,
on
the
one
hand
,
the
need
to
provide
the
highest
level
of
security
to
the
traveling
public
by
preventing
sensitive
security
information
from
falling
into
the
wrong
hands
,
and
on
the
other
hand
,
an
awareness
of
the
publics
strong
interest
in
obtaining
information
about
security
in
air
transportation
.
these
decisions
require
a
careful
evaluation
of
security
threats
as
well
as
important
policies
of
the
agency
.
therefore
,
the
faa
proposes
that
such
decisions
be
made
by
high
policylevel
policy
level
officials
,
and
not
below
the
assistant
administrator
and
deputy
assistant
administrator
level
.
the
assistant
administrator
is
responsible
for
carrying
out
the
agencys
civil
aviation
security
program
,
and
reports
directly
to
the
administrator

§

.
section
1913
would
continue
to
state
generally
that
the

withholds
certain
information

but
would
be
clarified
to
state
that
part

applies
,
notwithstanding
foia

other
disclosure
statutes

for
instance
,
the
faa
may
adopt
certain
security
rules
affecting
air
carriers
and
airports
without
disclosing
the
rules
to
unauthorized
persons
.
the
faa
proposes
to
move
the
provisions
currently
in
§
1915
that
describe
the
circumstances
under
which
the
faa
prohibits
disclosure
of
information
to
§
