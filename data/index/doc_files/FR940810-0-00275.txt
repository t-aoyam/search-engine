safety
precautions
asbestos

a
known
carcinogen
.
take
care
when
sampling
.
while
in
an
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
atmosphere
,
a
properly
selected
and
fittested
fit
tested
respirator
should
be
worn
.
take
samples
in
a
manner
to
cause
the
least
amount
of
dust
.
follow
these
general
guidelines
:
(
a
)
do
not
make
unnecessary
dust
.
(
b
)
take
only
a
small
amount
(
1

.
(
c
)
tightly
close
the
sample
container
.
(

)
use
encapsulant
to
seal
the
spot
where
the
sample
was
taken
,
if
necessary
.
23
.
sampling
procedure
samples
of
any
suspect
material
should
be
taken
from
an
inconspicuous
place
.
where
the
material
is
to
remain
,
seal
the
sampling
wound
with
an
encapsulant
to
eliminate
the
potential
for
exposure
from
the
sample
site
.
microscopy
requires
only
a
few
milligrams
of
material
.
the
amount
that
will
fill
a
20
ml
scintillation
vial
is
more
than
adequate
.
be
sure
to
collect
samples
from
all
layers
and
phases
of
material
.
if
possible
,
make
separate
samples
of
each
different
phase
of
the
material
.
this
will
aid
in
determining
the
actual
hazard
.
do
not
use
envelopes
,
plastic
or
paper
bags
of
any
kind
to
collect
samples
.
the
use
of
plastic
bags
presents
a
contamination
hazard
to
laboratory
personnel
and
to
other
samples
.
when
these
containers
are
opened
,
a
bellows
effect
blows
fibers
out
of
the
container
onto
everything
,
including
the
person
opening
the
container
.
if
a
corkborer
cork
borer
type
sampler
is
available
,
push
the
tube
through
the
material
all
the
way
,
so
that
all
layers
of
material
are
sampled
.
some
samplers
are
intended
to
be
disposable
.
these
should
be
capped
and
sent
to
the
laboratory
.
if
a
nondisposable
disposable
cork
borer
is
used
,
empty
the
contents
into
a
scintillation
vial
and
send
to
the
laboratory
.
vigorously
and
completely
clean
the
cork
borer
between
samples
.
24
shipment
samples
packed
in
glass
vials
must
not
touch
or
they
might
break
in
shipment
.
(
a
)
seal
the
samples
with
a
sample
seal
(
such
as
the
osha
21
)
over
the
end
to
guard
against
tampering
and
to
identify
the
sample
.
(
b
)
package
the
bulk
samples
in
separate
packages
from
the
air
samples
.
they
may
crosscontaminate
cross
contaminate
each
other
and
will
invalidate
the
results
of
the
air
samples
.
(
c
)
include
identifying
paperwork
with
the
samples
,
but
not
in
contact
with
the
suspected
asbestos
.
(
d
)
to
maintain
sample
accountability
,
ship
the
samples
by
certified
mail
,
overnight
express
,
or
hand
carry
them
to
the
