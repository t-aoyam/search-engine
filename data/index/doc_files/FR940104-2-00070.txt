in
addition
,
the
exchange
proposes
to
place
additional
restrictions
on
when
a
specialist
can
break
up
a
cross
transaction
.
11
thus
under
the
proposed
commentary
to
rule
5
14
,
the
specialist
will
be
prohibited
from
participating
,
for
the
benefit
of
his
or
her
own
account
,
on
(

)
either
side
of
a

customer
to
customer
cross
,
12
or
(

)
the
customer
side
of
a
cross
with
the
principal
account
of
a
member
,
where
the
cross
is
at
a
price
inside
the
disseminated
pse
market
.
the
pse
,
however
,
will
interpret
this
provision
to
allow
a
specialist
who
is
willing
to
better
the
price
to
participate
in
a
cross
transaction
.
13
finally
,
for
purposes
of
rule
5
14
,
the
exchange
will
define
a
`
customer
order
'
as
an
order
that
a
broker
represents
in
an
agency
capacity
,
including
a
professional
order
that
is
not
for
an
account
associated
with
the
executing
broker
.

the

finds
that

consistent

the
requirements

the
rules
and
regulations
thereunder
applicable
to

15
in
particular
,
the
commission
believes
that
the
proposed
rule
change
is
consistent
with
the
section
6b5
)
requirement
that
the
rules
of
an
exchange
be
designed
to
promote
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trade
,
to
prevent
fraudulent
and
manipulative
acts
and
,
in
general
,
to
protect
investors
and
the
public
interest
;
and
with
the
section
6b8
)
requirement
that
the
rules
of
an
exchange
not
impose
any
unnecessary
burden
on
competition
.
the
commission
also
believes
that
the
proposed
rule
change
does
not
operate
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
the
traditional
auction
market
principle
of
customer
priority
,
as
embodied
in
section

of

after
careful
review
,
the
commission
has
concluded
that
the
proposed
rule
change
should
further
competition
among
the
exchanges
,
as
well
as
between
exchanges
and
other
markets
,
and
should
increase
the
opportunities
for
the
efficient
execution
of
cross
transactions
.
in
the
past
,
the
commission
has
recognized
the
competition
that
exists
between
various
markets
for
order
flow
,
and
especially
for
block
business
.
several
exchanges
recently
have
sought
commission
approval
to
amend
their
rules
,
on
the
grounds
that
exchange
rules
may
hinder
members
'
ability
to
execute
a
cross
transaction
without
interference
and
thus
may
place
an
exchange
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
.
despite
serious
reservations
,
the
commission
has
approved
those
proposals
which
are
consistent
with
traditional
auction
market
principles
.
