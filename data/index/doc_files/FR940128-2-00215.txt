identification
licensees
may
not
expect
,
or
rely
on
,
nrc
to
identify
safety
problems
or
violations
for
them
.
the
enforcement
policy
provides
that
the
purpose
of
the
identification
factor
is
to
encourage
licensees
to
monitor
,
supervise
,
and
audit
activities
in
order
to
assure
safety
and
compliance
.
by
the
licensees
own
admission
,
it
did
not
detect
the
problems
noted
in
the
violation
during
the
15
years
that
its
qmp
has
been
in
existence
,
nor
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
licensee
identified
the
specific
problems
noted
in
the
violation
before
nrc
did
.
for
example
,
these
problems
are
not
noted
in
the
licensees
12/17/1992
misadministration
report
,
which
includes
a
section
entitled
,
`
improvements
and
actions
taken
to
prevent
recurrence
'
based
on
the
above
,
the
nrc
concludes
that
50
percent
escalation
of
the
base
civil
penalty
is
warranted
for
nrc
identification

licensee
performance
the
nrc
enforcement
policy
states
that
prior
performance
refers
to
the
licensees
performance
normally
(

)
within
the
last
two
years
of
the
inspection
at
issue
,
or
(
2
)
the
period
within
the
last
two
inspections
,
whichever
is
longer
.
on
this
case
the
period
covered
by
the
last
two
inspections
is
applicable
,
ie
,
two
inspections
prior
to
the
inspection
at
issue
.
the
two
previous
inspections
to
be
considered
are
the
inspection
conducted
on
09/11/1991
,
and
the
inspection
conducted
on
may
2123
,
1990
.
the
nrc
did
not
compare
the
licensees
performance
with
other
licensees
.
the
enforcement
policy
provides
that
the
effectiveness
of
previous
corrective
action
for
similar
problems
is
a
consideration
in
assessing
the
licensee
performance
factor
.
the
05/19/1990
inspection
was
conducted
to
review
the
circumstances
surrounding
a
teletherapy
misadministration
.
the
physicist
performing
the
treatment
dose
calculation
misinterpreted
the
physicians
written
prescription
.
the
error
continued
undetected
despite
at
least
four
separate
opportunities
for
the
dosimetry
and
physician
staffs
and
several
opportunities
for
the
technologists
to
identify
the
problem
.
in
its
misadministration
report
of
may
24
,
1990
,
the
licensee
noted
that
loss
of
objectivity
was
a
causative
factor
in
that
the
various
qa
checks
had
not
been
performed
as
an
independent
review
.
the
licensees
corrective
action
was
to
turn
an
existing
requirement
that
the
authorized
user
initial
the
chart
before
the
treatment
begins
into
a
full
qa
check
involving
a
review
by
the
physician
of
,
among
other
things
,
the
calculated
dose
per
fraction
.
a
memorandum
entitled
`
chart
checking
of
treatment
doses
and
calculations
'
was
circulated
to
emphasize
to
physicians
and
other
key
personnel
the
importance
of
vigilant
and
critically
minded
checking
of
doses
and
dose
calculations
.
thus
,
the
nrc
concludes
that
the
root
causes
of
the
misadministrations
are
sufficiently
similar
to
warrant
escalation
for
past
performance
.
the
licensee
also
argues
good
past
performance
in
that
a
very
small
percentage
of
its
treatments
were
misadministrations
.
on
the
contrary
,
the
nrc
is
concerned
that
the
licensee
was
performing
a
high
volume
of
treatments
with
a
deficient
qmp
.
based
on
the
above
,
100
percent
escalation
of
the
base
civil
penalty
is
warranted
for
poor
licensee
performance
.
nrc
conclusion
based
on
its
evaluation
of
the
licensees
response
,
the
nrc
staff
concludes
that
the
violation
did
occur
as
stated
,
and
that
neither
an
adequate
basis
for
a
reduction
of
the
severity
level
nor
for
mitigation
of
the
civil
penalty
has
been
provided
by
the
licensee
.
accordingly
,
nrc
concludes
that
a
civil
monetary
penalty
of
$
5000
should
be
imposed
by
order
.
