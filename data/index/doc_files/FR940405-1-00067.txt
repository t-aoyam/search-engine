concluded
that
the
probability
of
passive
smoking
is
highest
for
a
combination
of

social
and
work
activities
,
consistent
with
the
notion
that
activities
that

involve

a
limitation
of
the

survey
is
that
the

do
not
provide
information
on
the
intensity
of
exposure
in
the
various
microenvironments

in
summary
,
the
cap
study
showed
that
the
most
powerful
predictor
of
potential
exposure
to
ets
was
being
employed
.
respondents
who
spent
more
than
ten
hours
a
day
at
the
workplace
were
found
to
report
more
ets
exposure
than
those
working
less
than
10
hours
a
day
or
not
at
all
.
further
data
from
this
study
show
that
the
workplace
is
the
location
with
the
highest
reported
exposure
to
ets
in
enclosed
environments
,
and
such
exposure
is
on
average
nearly
three
times
more
prevalent
at
work
than
at
home
.
another
relevant
data
source
for
assessing
ets
exposure
in
the
workplace
is
the
