various
comments
concerned
the
`
wet

brush

method
'
a
developer
of
an
enclosure
method
for

clutch

asbestos
control
,
recommended
that
the
term
be
broadened
to
allow
`
more
latitude

he
suggested
that
the

be
changed
to

method

he
also
asked
that
osha
use
a
more
general
term
to
describe
the
preferred
enclosure
method
,
objecting
to
specification
of
its
shape
as
cylindrical
.
osha
agrees
that
the
shape
of
the
enclosure
need
not
be
specified
and
that
the
term
suggested
,
`
negative
pressure
enclosure
hepa
vacuum
system
'
was
appropriate
.
similarly
,
r
.
wagner
of
bp
of
america
felt
that
it
was
not
necessary
that
the
wet
brush
recycle
method
actually
include
a
brush
and
presented
monitoring
results
indicating
effective
fiber
control
when
spraying
on
the
solution
without
brushing
(
ex
.

.
osha
agrees
that
,
although
a
brush
is
useful
in
cleaning
the
components
,
the
preferred
method
will
be
designated
low
pressure
wet
cleaning
and
will
not
specify
the
use
of
a
brush
.
a
manufacturer
of
a
low
pressure
wet
cleaning
apparatus
,
objected
to
osha
requiring
use
of
an
aqueous
solution
in
the
machine
(
ex
.
1621
.
osha
understands
that
the
organic
solution
in
the
apparatus
is
a
degreaser
used
as
a
parts
cleaner
.
mr
.
swartz
in
testimony
explained
that
solvents
are
used
as
degreasers
,
but
that
most
brake
work
does
not
require
degreasinghe
estimated
that
only
once
per
200
to
300
brake
jobs
would
such
a
solvent
be
needed
(
tr
.
1843
.
osha
has
determined
that
it
will
maintain
the
requirement
that
aqueous
solutions
be
used
in
this
procedure
to
control
asbestos
fiber
levels
.
osha
further
warns
of
the
potential
danger
of
solvent
use
in
these
operations
and
that
use
of
solvents
,
which
are
often
flammable
and
may
be
carcinogenic
,
must
be
undertaken
with
great
care
.
osha
also
stresses
the
need
for
low
pressure
application
of
the
solution
to
the
surfaces
during
this
operation
to
avoid
asbestos
fiber
release
and
the
necessity
that
the
asbestoscontaminated
asbestos
contaminated
solution
not
be
allowed
to
dry
on
surfaces

a
manufacturer
of
a
wet

brush

type
brake
cleaner
,
hilgren
of
kleer
flo
,
offered
the
following
advice
to
users
of
this
method
regarding
disposal
of
waste
:
`
our
recommended
method
of
disposal
is
to
simply
add
adsorbent
material
such
as
`
floordry
floor
dry
'
to
the
waste
bag
.
then
direct
the
flow
through
brush
into
the
bag
containing
the
absorbent
material
.
allow
the
machine
to
pump
the
solution
from
the
reservoir
'
(

most
relevant
comments
supported
the
effectiveness
of
two
of
the
three
proposed
`
preferred
'
methods
:
the
enclosure
hepa
vacuum
method
and
the
wet
wash
recycle
system
.
however
,
substantial
opposition
was
directed
at
oshas
preference
for
the
solvent
spray
system
.
for
example
,
george
swartz
,
director
of
safety
for
midas
international
corporation
testified
that
`
the
utilization
of
an
aerosol
system
is
ludicrous
'
(
tr
.
1840
.
one
,
some
of
the
solvents
used
in
commercial
preparations
are
suspect
carcinogens
.
two
,
use
of
a
spray
can
does
not
reliably
control
exposures
due
to
asbestos
dust
in
the
brake
assembly
,
because
of
the
difficulties
of
removing
the
drum
,
and
that
after
removal
asbestos
containing
dust
in
the
assembly
cannot
easily
be
reached
by
a
aerosolized
spray
.
three
,
certain
solvent
sprays
,
according
to
mr
.
swartz
,
can
damage
friction
material
and
the
rubber
parts
of
the
cups
which
force
the
brake
shoe
out
to
the
drum
(
tr
1840
.
another
witness
,
james
e
.
clayton
,
testified
that
`
you
cant
take
a
can
of
compressed
solution
like
this
(
gunk
brake
cleaner
)
and
just
spray
it
on
dry
dust
without
it
getting
into
the
air
