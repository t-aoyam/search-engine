the

intended
to
ensure
that
all

,
is
safe
.
the

does
so
,
in
part
,
by
stipulating
that
no
substances
may
be
added
to
food
unless
they
are
safe

fda
has
defined
`
safe
'
as

a
reasonable
certainty
that

can
be
made
in
a
number

ways

the

the

conclusion
as
to
the
safety
of

for
its

use
may
be
based
on
either
:
(

scientific

published
scientific

of
