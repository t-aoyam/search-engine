quality
control
the
osha
asbestos
regulations
require
each
laboratory
to
establish
a
quality
control
program
.
the
following
is
presented
as
an
example
of
how
the
oshasltc
osha
sltc
constructed
its
internal
cv
curve
as
part
of
meeting
this
requirement
.
data
for
the
cv
curve
shown
below
is
from
395
samples
collected
during
osha
compliance
inspections
and
analyzed
from
10/19/1980
through
04/19/1986
.
each
sample
was
counted
by
2
to
5
different
counters
independently
of
one
another
.
the
standard
deviation
and
the
cv
statistic
was
calculated
for
each
sample
.
this
data
was
then
plotted
on
a
graph
of
cv
vs
.
fibers
mm2
.
a
least
squares
regression
was
performed
using
the
following
equation
:
cvantilog
10
[
alog
10
(
x
)
+
blog

(
xc
]
where
:
xthe
number
of
fibers
mm2
application
of
least
squares
gave
:
a0
1822
b0
9733
c0
3274
using
these
values
,
the
equation
becomes
:
