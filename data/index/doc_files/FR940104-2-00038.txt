summary
:
this
notice
announces
the
medicare
programs
proposal
to
revise
its
national
policy
by
withdrawing
coverage
for
diagnostic
nocturnal
penile
tumescence
(
npt
)
testing
in
the
sleep
disorder
clinic
.
for
all
other
settings
,
we
are
proposing
to
exclude
rather
than
withdraw
coverage
because
the
medicare
program
does
not
have
a
national
policy
that
provides
for
coverage
of
npt
testing
by
plethysmography
and
other
monitoring
devices
in
settings
other
than
sleep
disorder
clinics
.
public
health
service
studies
show
that
npt
testing
is
not
a
reliable
index
for
evaluating
impotence
.
therefore
,
it
does
not
meet
hcfas
criteria
for
effectiveness
.
