this
section
describes
the
painting
process
and
technologies
that
can
be
used
to
control
organic
hap
emissions
from
painting
operations
at
shipyards
.

description
of
the

the
proposed

at
the
beginning
of
this
preamble
.
over
99
percent
of
hap
emissions
at
shipyards
are
organic
solvents
associated
with
paints
and
cleaning
.
other
activities
that
collectively
contribute
the
remaining
1
percent
include
welding
,
metal
forming
cutting
,
and
abrasive
blasting
.
the
proposed
standards
will
affect
operations
involving
the
use
of
paint
and
organic

marine
coatings
are
applied
to
the
surface
of
ship
components
to
form

functional
or
decorative

the
basic
components
of
a
coating
are
the
vehicle
(
resin
or
binder
,
solvent
,
pigment
(
except
in
clear
coatings
,
and
a
variety
of
additives
.
different
coatings
are
used
for
different
purposes

marine
coatings
are
vital
for
protecting
the
ship
from
corrosive
and
biotic
attacks
from
the
water
environment
.
many
marine
coatings
serve
specific
functions
,
such
as
corrosion
protection
,
heat
fire
resistance
,
or
antifouling
(
to
prevent
the
settlement
and
growth
of
marine

the
most
popular
techniques
for
applying
coatings
to
marine
vessels
are
brushing
,
rolling
,
airatomizing
air
atomizing
,
and
airless
spraying
.
brushing
and
rolling
are
primarily
used
for
touchup
and
recessed
surfaces
where
spraying
is
not
practical
.
spraying
is
used
for
all
other
surfaces
because
of
its
high
application
speed

is
sometimes
added
to

state
that
it

,
reportedly
can
play
a
big
part
in
the
decision
to

cold
increases
paint
viscosity
.
for
such
cases
,
the
appropriate
solvent
to
use
for
each
coating
is
specified
by
the
manufacturer
.
typically
these
paints
and
thinning
solvents
contain
one
or
more
of
the
following

xylene
