section
1102b
)
of
the
act
requires
the
secretary
to
prepare
a
regulatory
impact
analysis
if
a
final
rule
may
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
operations
of
a
substantial
number
of
small
rural
hospitals
.
such
an
analysis
must
conform
to
the
provisions
of
section
603
of
the
rfa
.
for
purposes
of
section
1102b
)
of
the
act
,
we
define
a
small
rural
hospital
as
a
hospital
that
has
fewer
than
50
beds
and
is
located
outside
of
a
metropolitan
statistical
area
.
under
the
provisions
of
§
413
20
)
and
413
24
,
hospitals
are
required
to
submit
cost
reports
annually
,
with
reporting
periods
based
on
the
hospitals
accounting
year
.
this
is
generally
a
consecutive
12month
month
period
.
section
1886f1bi
)
of
the
act
now
requires
the
use
of
a
standardized
electronic
cost
reporting
format
for
hospitals
.
there
are
approximately
11
national
software
suppliers
that
distribute
cost
report
software
packages
to
hospitals
.
in
addition
,
hcfa
offers
a
cost
reporting
software
package
that
is
available
at
no
expense
to
any
hospital
that
requests
it
.
as
discussed
in
the
proposed
rule
,
computer
software
suppliers
and
hospitals
that
purchased
their
software
will
not
be
significantly
affected
by
these
provisions
.
suppliers
will
not
need
to
develop
new
software
and
hospitals
will
not
need
to
purchase
new
software
but
only
revise
the
software
or
have
the
cost
report
portion
of
the
software
revised
based
on
standard
format
requirements
set
by
hcfa
.
although
the
cost
report
portion
of
software
packages
will
be
exactly
the
same
,
competition
among
suppliers
will
not
be
adversely
affected
since
each
offers
other
features
that
make
its
product
unique
.
hospitals
that
will
be
most
affected
by
this
final
rule
with
comment
period
are
those
that
may
be
unable
to
afford
the
equipment
to
submit
electronically
.
these
hospitals
might
include
hospitals
that
have
very
few
medicare
beneficiaries
and
small
rural
hospitals
.
hospitals
that
have
access
to
computer
equipment
can
utilize
and
benefit
from
hcfas
free
software
if
they
are
unable
to
afford
the
software
that
is
available
from
suppliers
.
however
,
as
stated
above
,
we
have
received
only
eight
requests
for
waiver
of
electronic
cost
reporting
.
we
believe
that
the
small
number
of
requests
indicates
that
the
vast
majority
of
hospitals
will
not
experience
financial
hardship
due
to
the
requirements
of
this
final
rule
with
comment
period
.
in
conclusion
,
this
final
rule
with
comment
period
will
not
have
a
significant
effect
on
hospital
costs
since
hospitals
will
not
be
required
to
collect
any
additional
data
beyond
that
which
the
regulations
currently
specify
;
costreport
cost
report
software
is
available
at
no
cost
from
hcfa
to
any
hospital
that
requests
it
;
and
most
hospitals
have
some
type
of
computer
equipment
through
which
they
are
currently
submitting
electronically
prepared
cost
reports
.
hospitals
will
only
be
affected
to
the
extent
that
all
would
be
required
to
submit
cost
reports
in
a
standardized
electronic
format
to
their
respective
intermediary
.
a
hospital
that
does
not
comply
with
the
provisions
of
this
rule
,
as
specified
in
the
preamble
,
will
be
subject
to
sections
1815a
)
and
1833e
)
of
the
act
,
which
provide
that
no
payments
will
be
made
to
a
hospital
unless
it
has
furnished
the
information
requested
by
the
secretary
that
is
needed
to
determine
the
amount
of
payments
due
the
hospital
under
medicare
.
this
final
rule
with
comment
period
will
not
have
a
significant
effect
on
a
substantial
number
of
medicare
participating
hospitals
or
software
suppliers
.
therefore
,
a
regulatory
flexibility
analysis
is
not
required
.
we
are
not
preparing
a
rural
impact
statement
since
the
secretary
certifies
that
this
final
rule
with
comment
period
will
not
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
the
operation
of
a
substantial
number
of
small
rural
hospitals
.
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
executive
order
12866
,
this
regulation
was
not
reviewed
by
the
office
of
management
and
budget
.
