paragraph
(
d3
)
of
the
construction
standard
states
the
enforcement
rule
that
regardless
of
who
created
a
hazard
,
the
employer
of
exposed
employees
is
required
to
comply
with
applicable
protective
provisions
to
protect
his
employees
.
an
example
recited
in
the
regulatory
text
presents
the
situation
of
employees
working
immediately
adjacent
to
a
class
i
regulated
area
.
if
there
is
a
breach
of
the
enclosure
or
the
critical
barriers
surrounding
the
asbestos
work
,
employees
working
immediately
adjacent
to
the
work
may
be
exposed
to
asbestos
.
the
employer
responsible
for
erecting
the
enclosure
is
required
to
insure
its
integrity
.
however
,
in
the
event
that
such
repair
is
delayed
or
not
made
,
the
employer
of
the
exposed
`
bystander
employees
'
must
designate
a
`
competent
person
'
to
evaluate
the
exposure
potential
,
conduct
initial
monitoring
or
an
`
exposure
assessment
'
and
supervise
other
required
protective
actions
.
the
evaluation
may
include
the
amount
of
time
and
frequency
adjacent
workers
are
exposed
.
for
example
,
although
passing
through
a
contaminated
area
on
the
way
to
perform
nonasbestos
asbestos
related
activities
is
technically
work
which
exposes
employees
to
asbestos
,
the
competent
persons
evaluation
properly
may
conclude
that
no
appreciable
exposure
is
possible
because
of
the
brevity
of
the
`
work
'
in
the
area
.

regulated
areas
paragraph
(

)
general
industry
,
construction
and
shipyard
employment
standards
.
regulated
areas
are
a
traditional
component
of
osha
health
standards
.
they
segregate
both
the
work
and
the
worker
so
as
to
better
regulate
the
work
,
and
to
protect
uninvolved
employees
from
exposure
.
the
1986
standards
required
regulated
areas
for
work
above
the
pels
and
in
construction
,
for
demolition
,
renovation
and
removal
activities
.
the
final
standards
require
that
regulated
areas
be
established
where
the
pels
are
likely
to
be
exceeded
,
and
under
the
construction
and
shipyard
employment
standards
,
where
class
i
,
ii
and
iii
asbestos
work
is
performed
.
these
requirements
are
substantively
similar
to
those
proposed
in
1990
.
the
basic
requirements
of
the
regulated
areas
are
the
same
for
all
three
standards
,
they
are
changed
from
the
current
standard
to
more
coherently
reflect
the
rest
of
the
standards
provisions
.
for
example
,
paragraph
(
e2
)
which
requires
the
regulated
area
to
be
`
demarcated
to
minimize
the
number
of
persons
within
the
area
,
and
to
protect
persons
outside
the
area
from
exposure
to
airborne
concentrations
of
asbestos
'
has
been
changed
in
two
ways
.
the
phrase
`
in
any
manner
'
has
been
deleted
.
since
,
paragraph
(
g
)
requires
critical
barriers
for
class
i
and
ii
work
,
and
paragraph
(
k
)
requires
warning
signs
outside
regulated
areas
,
demarcation
must
incorporate
barriers
and
signs
where
otherwise
required
.
osha
has
also
deleted
the
phrase
`
in
excess
of
the
twa
and
or
excursion
limit
'
in
the
construction
and
shipyard
employment
standards
to
describe
the
level
of
protection
intended
to
be
offered
persons
outside
the
regulated
area
.
since
osha
has
determined
that
a
still
significant
risk
remains
below
the
pels
,
intended
protection
should
not
be
limited
to
protecting
down
to
these
levels
.
osha
noted
in
its
1990
proposal
that
in
the
construction
standard
,
`
the
regulated
area
controls
are
proposed
to
apply
even
when
exposures
may
be
less
than
the
newly
proposed
pel
of
01
f
cc
'
(

fr
at

,
however
,
no
change
was
proposed
for
the
`
demarcation
'
provision
.
paragraph
(
e3
)
is
unchanged
and
continues
to
limit
access
to
regulated
areas
to

authorized
persons

the

proposed

,
which
dictated
when
negative

enclosures
(

)
must
be
erected
,
and
various
duties
required
of
the
`
competent
persons
'
to
ensure
integrity
of
the
regulated
area
and
enclosure
.
under
oshas
former
approach
,
negative
pressure
enclosures
were
,
in
many
cases
,
how
construction
employers
should
have
demarcated
their
regulated
areas
.
osha
focussed
on
the
role
of
such
enclosures
in
providing
`
bystander
protection
'
in
these
final
standards
,
osha
is
repositioning
the

are
to

and
thus
whether
additional

are
