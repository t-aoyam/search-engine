supplementary
information
:
this
proposal
was
a
solicited
application
.
the
electric
power
research
institute
(
epri
)
issued
a
request
for
proposal
(

rfp365701
`
next
generation
geothermal
power

1
studies
'
on
06/02/1993
.
the
purpose
of
the
rfp
was
to
conduct
studies
that
would
expedite
development
of
the
next
generation
of
geothermal
power
plants
.
this
includes
development
,
evaluation
and
comparison
of
power
plant
concepts
and
ranking
of
the
suitability
of
these
concepts
for
various
geothermal
resources
.
after
a
competitive
evaluation
process
,
epri
selected
the
ben
holt
company
to
perform
the
study
.
negotiations
with
the
department
of
energy
(
doe
)
for
additional
funding
resulted
in
3
additional
power
plant
concepts
to
be
added
to
the
scope
of
work
.
competition
for
this
effort
would
not
be
appropriate
for
this
effort
since
epri
has
already
gone
through
a
competitive
process
and
it
would
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
continuance
and
completion
of
the
study
.
the
proposed
project
will
contribute
to
the
doe
mission
of
`
*

*
*
*
providing
the
scientific
foundation
[
and

technology
*
*
*
*
*

necessary
to
achieve
efficiency
in
energy
use
,
diversity
in
energy
sources
,
and
access
to
technical
information
*
*
*
*

.
the
results
of
the
study
will
be
published
,
presented
at
several
geothermal
conferences
and
made
available
to
the
geothermal
industry
and
to
the
public
.
the
proposed
study
to
be
completed
by
the
ben
holt
company
are
in
harmony
with
the
direction
of
the
geothermal
energy
conversion
program
.
the
objectives
of
this
effort
are
to
evaluate
the
feasibility
,
efficiency
,
environmental
impacts
and
the
economics
of
geothermal
power
plant
technologies
.
this
study
is
envisioned
to
be
vital
to
developers
in
determining
which
technology
to
use
to
most
efficiently
utilize
their
geothermal
resource
.
technologies
that
will
be
covered
through
this
study
are
the
following
:
commercial
aircooled
air
cooled
binary
plants
;
commercial
flash
plants
;
advanced
binary
cycles
,
which
includes
the
use
of
mixed
and
alternative
working
fluids
,
alternative
cooling
systems
,
advanced
turbines
and
supersaturated
turbine
expansion
;
the
kalina
cycle
,
which
uses
an
ammoniawater
ammonia
water
mixture
as
the
working
fluid
and
regenerative
preheating
heating
and
partial
vaporization
;
advanced
flash
concepts
that
will
incorporate
the
use
of
equipment
advances
and
cycle
modifications
;
the
use
of
rotary
separator
turbines
in
lieu
of
steam
flash
tanks
;
subatmospheric
sub
atmospheric
flash
cycles
;
hot
dry
rock
;
steam
flash
binary
hybrid
plants
;
and
geothermal
natural
gas
hybrid
plants
.
the
above
listed
technologies
will
be
optimized
and
rated
for
various
geothermal
resources
.
the
geothermal
resources
that
will
be
used
in
this
evaluation
provide
a
cross
section
of
possible
temperature
and
pressure
ranges
available
.
the
probability
of
meeting
the
objectives
listed
above
are
very
high
.
the
ben
holt
company
has
been
involved
in
the
geothermal
industry
for
over
30
years
,
and
the
individuals
involved
have
the
experience
and
education
that
are
needed
and
required
for
this
study
.
the
staff
of
the
ben
holt
company
are
qualified
and
positioned
to
provide
this
service
.
part
of
the
competitive
process
accomplished
by
epri
was
to
verify
that
the
applicants
personnel
were
qualified
to
preform
this
task
.
doe
has
also
verified
that
the
individuals
involved
in
this
study
have
the
appropriate
education
and
experience
.
the
ben
holt
companys
base
of
operations
is
an
office
in
pasadena
,
california
,
and
is
fully
capable
of
meeting
their
needs
.
the
budget
proposed
for
the
anticipated
work
was
reviewed
and
is
considered
to
be
appropriate
and
adequate
.
the
public
benefit
to
be
derived
from
the
proposed
study
will
be
an
evaluation
that
shows
utilities
,
independent
power
producers
and
developers
how
to
optimize
the
geothermal
resources
that
are
available
to
them
.
this
study
will
also
show
the
economics
and
the
environmental
benefits
of
using
geothermal
energy
.
the
evaluation
accomplished
through
the
proposed
cooperative
agreement
support
the
geothermal
energy
conversion
programs
direction
and
objectives
.
epri
has
competitively
chosen
the
ben
holt
company
to
perform
this
evaluation
.
therefore
,
issuing
a
solicitation
for
a
competitive
bid
to
accomplish
a
study
of
the
next
generation
geothermal
power
plant
would
be
inappropriate
and
would
have
a
significant
adverse
impact
on
the
accomplishment
and
completion
of
the
desired
report
