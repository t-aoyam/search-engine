fsis
does
agree
,
however
,
with
the
comments
regarding
the
benefits
of
fat
and
protein
content
information
provided
by
nutrition
labeling
.
since
the
products
that
typically
contain
mechanically
separated
poultry
,
eg
,
poultry
sausages
,
are
composed
of
this
ingredient
as
the
majority
of
their
formulation
,
the
nutrition
labeling
for
such
product
will
primarily
reflect
the
protein
and
fat
contributed
by
the
mechanically
separated
poultry
component
.
for
this
reason
,
a
minimum
protein
content
and
a
maximum
fat
content
requirement
for
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
are
not
needed
,
given
the
implementation
of
the
departments
nutrition
labeling
regulations
on
july
6
,
1994
(
58
fr
632
.
the
nutrition
labeling
regulations
require
the
declaration
of
protein
and
fat
on
the
labeling
(
ie
,
the
nutrition
facts
panel
)
of
most
multiingredient
ingredient
meat
and
poultry
products
.
nutrition
labeling
is
now
required
on
most
processed
products
purchased
by
consumers
in
retail
stores
,
and
this
,
together
with
the
departments
voluntary
nutrition
labeling
program
established
for
retail
store
information
on
singleingredient
single
ingredient
raw
products
,
makes
fsis
believe
that
consumers
will
have
sufficient
information
on
protein
and
fat
for
most
products
purchased
for
consumption
at
home
.
fsis
further
believes
that
the
need
to
establish
a
fat
and
protein
requirement
is
minimized
because
current
regulatory
controls
will
limit
the
amount
of
skin
or
fat
that
may
be
used
in
formulating
poultry
products
with
mechanically
separated
poultry
.
according
to
the
poultry
regulations
,
viz
,
9
cfr
381
117
,
raw
materials
used
to
manufacture
boneless
poultry
,
eg
,
`
mechanically
separated
chicken
'
and
`
mechanically
separated
turkey
'
must
be
labeled
to
reflect
the
presence
of
skin
and
attached
fat
when
the
proportions
of
skin
and
attached
fat
are
in
excess
of
that
which
occurs
naturally
on
a
whole
carcass
.
therefore
,
products
currently
labeled
as
`
mechanically
separated
chicken
'
or
`
mechanically
separated
turkey
'
contain
no
more
skin
with
attached
fat
than
that
which
occurs
naturally
on
a
whole
carcass
,
for
which
there
is
no
maximum
fat
content
established
.
furthermore
,
like
all
other
animal
products
,
poultry
(
eg
,
whole
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
)
is
composed
of
water
,
fat
,
protein
,
and
inorganic
matter
(
ie
,
ash
.
if
the
fat
content
is
controlled
,
the
proportion
of
the
other
components
,
including
protein
,
should
remain
the
same
as
that
which
occurs
naturally

fourteen
commenters
addressed
the
issue
of
bone
particle
size
in
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
.
twelve
of
the
14
commenters
disagreed
with
restricting
the
size
of
the
bone
particles
present
in
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
to
a
maximum
of
less
than
15
millimeter
(
mm
)
in
the
greatest
dimension
.
furthermore
,
commenters
sought
clarification
of
the
quantity
of
particles
of
acceptable
dimension
that
would
be
permitted
.
the
commenters
also
stated
that
there
is
no
justification
for
requiring
standardized
bone
particle
size
limitations
;
such
a
criteria
will
result
in
increased
analytical
costs
to
the
processor
without
improving
food
safety
.
other
commenters
cited
the
1979
report
on
`
health
and
safety
aspects
of
the
use
of
mechanically
deboned
poultry
'
which
states
that
over
90
percent
of
the
bone
particles
found
in
mechanically
deboned
poultry
are
less
than
150
microns
(
0
15
mm
)
in
size
and
only
1
percent
were
greater
than
400
microns
(
04
mm
.
fsis
believes
that
a
bone
particle
size
limitation
augments
the
bone
solids
content
restriction
,
and
is
a
meaningful
indication
of
a
poultry
deboning
operation
that
effectively
controls
bone
breakage
.
the
1979
health
and
safety
report
recommended
that
bone
particle
size
be
controlled
to
ensure
that
equipment
type
or
processing
does
not
result
in
unacceptably
large
bone
fragments
in
mechanically
deboned
poultry
.
fsis
agrees
with
this
recommendation
and
continues
to
support
its
tentative
position
of
restricting
the
bone
particle
size
in
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
.
however
,
fsis
is
in
agreement
with
the
comments
that
reflected
a
need
to
clarify
the
parameters
for
such
a
restriction
.
in
order
to
simplify
such
a
requirement
for
mechanically
separated
poultry
products
,
fsis
is
proposing
that
at
least
98
percent
of
the
bone
particles
present
in
mechanically
separated
poultry
should
have
a
maximum
size
no
greater
than
15
mm
and
no
bone
particles
should
be
greater
than
2
mm
in
their
greatest
dimension
.
these
parameters
are
similar
to
the
requirements
for
bone
particle
size
for
mss
,
a
similar
livestock
product
.
