comment
:
several
commenters
expressed
concern
over
the
harbor
porpoise
abundance
estimates
for
the
gulf
of
maine
bay
of
fundy
population
and
the
disparity
between
the
point
estimates
for
1991
and
1992
.
they
urged
the
council
to
ask
nmfs
to
conduct
ongoing
surveys
in
order
to
better
refine
the
data
.
response
:
again
,
the
estimates
are
based
on
the
best
scientific
information
available
.
nmfs
abundance
estimates
for
1991
and
1992
are
37500
(
%
coefficient
of
variation
(
cv288
,
95
%
confidence
interval
(
ci26700
to
86400
)
and
67500
(
cv231
,
95
%
ci32900
to
104600
,
respectively
.
the
reason
for
the
nearly
twofold
,
but
statistically
insignificant
,
increase
between
1991
and
1992
is
unknown
.
although
the
increase
is
statistically
insignificant
,
it
may
reflect
a
real
change
in
abundance
due
to
a
distribution
change
or
methodological
sampling
error
.
methods
to
investigate
this
difference
were
recommended
at
the
february
2325
nefsc
workshop
to
evaluate
the
status
of
harbor
porpoise
in
the
western
north
atlantic
.
an
abundance
survey
has
been
recommended
for
1995
.
comment
:
a
suggestion
was
made
to
divide
the
northeast
closure
area
in
half
,
longitudinally
,
or
simply
to
make
the
entire
area
smaller
.
response
:
the
northeast
area
proposed
for
closure
from
august
15
through
september
13
already
represents
a
compromise
forged
between
fishermen
and
the
council
.
but
concerns
still
exist
that
animals
will
move
into
adjacent
areas
where
vessels
may
concentrate
and
increase
the
likelihood
of
takes
,
rather
than
reduce
that
possibility
.
also
,
nmfs
survey
data
indicate
that
harbor
porpoise
usually
frequent
the
same
general
areas
of
the
gulf
of
maine
,
but
not
always
at
the
same
time
every
year
.
because
of
this
variability
,
shorter
closures
in
smaller
areas
could
result
in
little
or
no
reduction
in
bycatch
,
if
animals
are
not
present
during
the
closure
period
.
this
would
result
in
lost
fishing
time
with
no
benefit
.
comment
:
commenters
expressed
concern
about
northeast
time
and
area
closures
that
would
eliminate
fishing
in
the
schoodic
ridge
area
,
a
region
vital
to
the
`
downeast
'
fishermen
.
response
:
the
councils
final
decision
took
into
account
the
fact
that
the
time
and
area
plan
would
be
phased
in
over
4
years
.
during
the
first
year
of
implementation
,
the
schoodic
ridge
fishing
grounds
will
be
left
open
.
further
changes
to
the
area
will
be
based
on
the
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
estimates
derived
from
sea
sampling
program
and
other
relevant
data
submitted
to
the
council
.
comment
:
commenters
from
maine
questioned
why
jeffreys
ledge
,
an
area
located
off
the
coasts
of
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
that
accounts
for
a
relatively
high
level
of
bycatch
,
was
being
left
open
in
the
first
year
of
the
plan
.
response
:
the
councils
midcoast
mid
coast
closure
area
incorporates
an
area
known
as
jeffreys
basin
,
but
excludes
jeffreys
ledge
.
in
past
years
,
the
basin
area
has
represented
a
higher
level
of
bycatch
than
jeffreys
ledge
.
concerns
focus
on
whether
the
displacement
of
more
fishing
effort
onto
jeffreys
ledge
might
account
for
a
kill
rate
as
high
as
or
potentially
higher
than
,
in
previous
years
.
as
with
the
northeast
area
,
however
,
the
council
considered
the
boundaries
adequate
for
year
one
of
implementation
of
framework
adjustment
4
.
bycatch
of
harbor
porpoise
will
be
monitored
and
the
need
to
adjust
the
boundaries
can
be
accomplished
under
the
framework
system
.
comment
:
one
individual
asked
for
an
exemption
for
smallboat
small
boat
operators
who
fish
inshore
only
,
and
who
are
responsible
for
little
or
no
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
.
otherwise
,
they
would
effectively
be
excluded
from
the
fishery
as
of
the
november
130
midcoast
mid
coast
closure
because
they
are
too
small
to
fish
in
offshore
conditions
.
another
commenter
suggested
that
these
vessels
fish
under
the
500pound
pound
(
2268
kg
)
possession
limit
for
regulated
species
of
groundfish
.
response
:
harbor
porpoise
throughout
the
gulf
of
maine
are
distributed
both
inshore
and
offshore
and
become
entangled
in
gillnets
,
regardless
of
vessel
size
.
additionally
,
all
sink
gillnet
vessels
fishing
under
a
federal
multispecies
permit
,
regardless
of
where
they
are
fishing
,
are
subject
to
the
porpoise
bycatch
reduction
measures
.
comment
:
gillnet
gear
should
be
given
credit
,
one
commenter
said
,
for
being
sizeselective
size
selective
and
for
resulting
in
discards
of
juvenile
finfish
.
response
:
once
the
time
and
area
program
has
been
in
place
(
approximately
1
year
from
the
date
of
implementation
,
the
council
will
evaluate
the
impact
of
the
gillnet
fishery
on
the
mortality
of
groundfish
stocks
and
develop
management
measures
that
are
appropriate
for
the
gillnet
sector
.
comment
:
some
commenters
felt
the
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
reduction
program
was
a
mechanism
being
used
by
other
interests
to
close
the
sink
gillnet
fishery
.
response
:
the
councils
measures
are
designed
to
minimize
impacts
on
the
sink
gillnet
fishery
,
while
at
the
same
time
achieve
the
stated
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
reduction
objectives
.
the
council
has
held
16
public
meetings
since
its
initial
commitment
to
incorporate
bycatch
measures
in
amendment
5
and
has
involved
the
fishing
community
,
conservation
groups
and
interested
parties
in
the
development
of
the
fmp
.
comment
:
several
commenters
felt
it
was
inappropriate
to
use
the
harbor
porpoise
time
and
area
closure
plan
to
protect
endangered
whales
.
response
:
as
part
of
the
councils
obligations
under
section
7
of
the
esa
,
a
consultation
with
nmfs
is
required
if
a
fishery
affects
,
either
directly
or
indirectly
,
endangered
or
threatened
species
or
any
designated
critical
habitat
.
because
this
framework
adjustment
represents
a
change
in
management
measures
for
a
gear
type
that
has
interactions
with
endangered
species
,
the
council
reinitiated
initiated
the
section
7
consultation
developed
for
amendment
5
,
identified
potential
interactions
and
has
addressed
them
in
the
context
of
this
framework
adjustment
.
comment
:
many
fishermen
supported
the
use
of
`
pingers
'
sound
emitting
devices
that
increase
an
animals
awareness
of
nets
,
as
a
bycatch
mitigation
measure
.
a
suggestion
was
made
to
use
pingers
in
year
1
of
implementation
of
amendment
5
in
conjunction
with
fourday
four
day
blocks
of
time
,
but
with
no
subsequent
expansion
of
the
days
during
which
nets
would
be
removed
from
the
water
in
future
years
.
