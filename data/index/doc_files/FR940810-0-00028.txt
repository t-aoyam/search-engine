background

the
provisions
of
the
clean
air
act
,
as
amended
in
1990
,
(
caa
'
or
`
the
act
,
will
require
many
small
businesses
to
be
regulated
so
that
areas
may
attain
and
maintain
the
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
(
naaqs
)
and
the
emission
of
air
toxics
will
be
reduced
.
small
businesses
frequently
lack
the
technical
expertise
and
financial
resources
necessary
to
evaluate
such
regulations
and
to
determine
the
appropriate
mechanisms
for
compliance
.
in
anticipation
of
the
impact
of
these
requirements
on
small
businesses
,
the
act
requires
that
states
adopt
a
small
business
stationary
source
technical
and
environmental
compliance
assistance
program
(
program
,
and
submit
this
program
to
be
incorporated
as
a
revision
of
the
federally
approved
sip
.
in
addition
,
the
act
directs
the
usepa
to
oversee
these
small
business
assistance
programs
and
report
to
congress
on
their
implementation
.
the
requirements
for
establishing
a
program
are
set
out
in
section
507
of
title
v
of
the
act
.
in
02/19/1992
,
usepa
issued
guidelines
for
the
implementation
of
section
507
of
the
1990
clean
air
act
amendments
,
in
order
to
delineate
the
federal
and
state
roles
in
meeting
the
new
statutory
provisions
and
as
a
tool
to
provide
further
guidance
to
the
states
on
submitting
an
acceptable
program
.
in
order
to
gain
full
approval
,
a
state
submittal
must
provide
for
each
of
the
following
program
elements
:
(
1
)
the
establishment
of
a
small
business
assistance
program
(
sbap
)
to
provide
technical
and
compliance
assistance
to
small
businesses
;
(
2
)
the
establishment
of
a
state
small
business
ombudsman
to
represent
the
interests
of
small
businesses
in
the
regulatory
process
;
and
(
3
)
the
creation
of
a
compliance
advisory
panel
(
