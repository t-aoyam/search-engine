for
this
test
,
align
the
fiber
at
45
&
cir
;
to
the
polarization
directions
in
order
to
maximize
the
contribution
to
each
of
the
optical
axes
.
the
colors
seen
are
called
retardation
colors
.
they
arise
from
the
recombination
of
light
which
has
traveled
through
the
two
separate
directions
of
the
crystal
.
one
of
the
rays
is
retarded
behind
the
other
since
the
light
in
that
direction
travels
slower
.
on
recombination
,
some
of
the
colors
which
make
up
white
light
are
enhanced
by
constructive
interference
and
some
are
suppressed
by
destructive
interference
.
the
result
is
a
color
dependent
on
the
difference
between
the
indices
and
the
thickness
of
the
crystal
.
the
proper
colors
,
thicknesses
,
and
retardations
are
shown
on
a
michellevy
michel
levy
chart
.
the
three
items
,
retardation
,
thickness
and
birefringence
are
related
by
the
following
relationship
:
r
=
=
tn
)
)
r
=
=
retardation
,
t
=
=
crystal
thickness

and
ag

of
refraction
.
examination
of
the
equation
for
asbestos
minerals
reveals
that
the
visible
colors
for
almost
all
common
asbestos
minerals
and
fiber
sizes
are
shades
of
gray
and
black
.
the
eye
is
relatively
poor
at
discriminating
different
shades
of
gray
.
it
is
very
good
at
discriminating
different
colors
.
in
order
to
compensate
for
the
low
retardation
,
a
compensator
is
added
to
the
light
train
between
the
polarization
elements
.
the
compensator
used
for
this
test
is
a
gypsum
plate
of
known
thickness
and
birefringence
.
such
a
compensator
when
oriented
at
45
&
cir
;
to
the
polarizer
direction
,
provides
a
retardation
of
530
nm
of
the
530
nm
wavelength
color
.
this
enhances
the
red
color
and
gives
the
background
a
characteristic
red
to
redmagenta
red
magenta
color
.
if
this
`
fullwave
full
wave
'
compensator
is
in
place
when
the
asbestos
preparation
is
inserted
into
the
light
train
,
the
colors
seen
on
the
fibers
are
quite
different
.
gypsum
,
like
asbestos
has
a
fast
axis
and
a
slow
axis
.
when
a
fiber
is
aligned
with
its
fast
axis
in
the
same
direction
as
the
fast
axis
of
the
gypsum
plate
,
the
ray
vibrating
in
the
slow
direction
is
retarded
by
both
the
asbestos
and
the
gypsum
.
this
results
in
a
higher
retardation
than
would
be
present
for
either
of
the
two
minerals
.
the
color
seen
is
a
second
order
blue
.
when
the
fiber
is
rotated
90
&
cir
;
using
the
rotating
stage
,
the
slow
direction
of
the
fiber
is
now
aligned
with
the
fast
direction
of
the
gypsum
and
the
fast
direction
of
the
fiber
is
aligned
with
the
slow
direction
of
the
gypsum
.
thus
,
one
ray
vibrates
faster
in
the
fast
direction
of
the
gypsum
,
and
slower
in
the
slow
direction
of
the
fiber
;
the
other
ray
will
vibrate
slower
in
the
slow
direction
of
the
gypsum
and
faster
in
the
fast
direction
of
the
fiber
.
in
this
case
,
the
effect
is
subtractive
and
the
color
seen
is
a
first
order
yellow
.
as
long
as
the
fiber
thickness
does
not
add
appreciably
to
the
color
,
the
same
basic
colors
will
be
seen
for
all
asbestos
types
except
crocidolite
.
in
crocidolite
the
colors
will
be
weaker
,
may
be
in
the
opposite
directions
,
and
will
be
altered
by
the
blue
absorption
color
natural
to
crocidolite
.
hundreds
of
other
materials
will
give
the
same
colors
as
asbestos
,
and
therefore
,
this
test
is
not
definitive
for
asbestos
.
the
test
is
useful
in
discriminating
against
fiberglass
or
other
amorphous
fibers
such
as
some
synthetic
fibers
.
certain
synthetic
fibers
will
show
retardation
colors
different
than
asbestos
;
however
,
there
are
some
forms
of
polyethylene
and
aramid
which
will
show
morphology
and
retardation
colors
similar
to
asbestos
minerals
.
this
test
must
be
supplemented
with
a
positive
identification
test
when
birefringent
fibers
are
present
which
can
not
be
excluded
by
morphology
.
this
test
is
relatively
ineffective
for
use
on
fibers
less
than
1
m
in
diameter
.
for
positive
confirmation
tem
or
sem
should
be
used
if
no
larger
bundles
or
fibers
are
visible
.
46
.
dispersion
staining
dispersion
microscopy
or
dispersion
staining
is
the
method
of
choice
for
the
identification
of
asbestos
in
bulk
materials
.
becke
line
analysis
is
used
by
some
laboratories
and
yields
the
same
results
as
does
dispersion
staining
for
asbestos
and
can
be
used
in
lieu
of
dispersion
staining
.
dispersion
staining
is
performed
on
the
same
platform
as
the
phasepolar
phase
polar
analysis
with
the
analyzer
and
compensator
removed
.
one
polarizing
element
remains
to
define
the
direction
of
the
light
so
that
the
different
indices
of
refraction
of
the
fibers
may
be
separately
determined
.
dispersion
microscopy
is
a
darkfield
dark
field
technique
when
used
for
asbestos
.
particles
are
imaged
with
scattered
light
.
light
which
is
unscattered
is
blocked
from
reaching
the
eye
either
by
the
back
field
image
mask
in
a
mccrone
objective
or
a
back
field
image
mask
in
the
phase
condenser
.
the
most
convenient
method
is
to
use
the
rotating
phase
condenser
to
move
an
oversized
phase
ring
into
place
.
the
ideal
size
for
this
ring
is
for
the
central
disk
to
be
just
larger
than
the
objective
entry
aperture
as
viewed
in
the
back
focal
plane
.
the
larger
the
disk
,
the
less
scattered
light
reaches
the
eye
.
this
will
have
the
effect
of
diminishing
the
intensity
of
dispersion
color
and
will
shift
the
actual
color
seen
.
the
colors
seen
vary
even
on
microscopes
from
the
same
manufacturer
.
this
is
due
to
the
different
bands
of
wavelength
exclusion
by
different
mask
sizes
.
the
mask
may
either
reside
in
the
condenser
or
in
the
objective
back
focal
plane
.
it
is
imperative
that
the
analyst
determine
by
experimentation
with
asbestos
standards
what
the
appropriate
colors
should
be
for
each
asbestos
type
.
the
colors
depend
also
on
the
temperature
of
the
preparation
and
the
exact
chemistry
of
the
asbestos
.
therefore
,
some
slight
differences
from
the
standards
should
be
allowed
.
this
is
not
a
serious
problem
for
commercial
asbestos
uses
.
this
technique
is
used
for
identification
of
the
indices
of
refraction
for
fibers
by
recognition
of
color
.
there
is
no
direct
numerical
readout
of
the
index
of
refraction
.
correlation
of
color
to
actual
index
of
refraction
is
possible
by
referral
to
published
conversion
tables
.
this
is
not
necessary
for
the
analysis
of
asbestos
.
recognition
of
appropriate
colors
along
with
the
proper
morphology
are
deemed
sufficient
to
identify
the
commercial
asbestos
minerals
.
other
techniques
including
sem
,
tem
,
and
xrd
may
be
required
to
provide
additional
information
in
order
to
identify
other
types
of
asbestos
.
make
a
preparation
in
the
suspected
matching
high
dispersion
oil
,
eg
,
n1
550
for
chrysotile
.
perform
the
preliminary
tests
to
determine
whether
the
fibers
are
birefringent
or
not
.
take
note
of
the
morphological
character
.
wavy
fibers
are
indicative
of
chrysotile
while
long
,
straight
,
thin
,
frayed
fibers
are
indicative
of
amphibole
asbestos
.
this
can
aid
in
the
selection
of
the
appropriate
matching
oil
.
the
microscope
is
set
up
and
the
polarization
direction
is
noted
as
in
section
44
.
align
a
fiber
with
the
polarization
direction
.
note
the
color
.
this
is
the
color
parallel
to
the
polarizer
.
then
rotate
the
fiber
rotating
the
stage
90
&
cir
;
so
that
the
polarization
direction
is
across
the
fiber
.
this
is
the
perpendicular
position
.
again
note
the
color
.
both
colors
must
be
consistent
with
standard
asbestos
minerals
in
the
correct
direction
for
a
positive
identification
of
asbestos
.
if
only
one
of
the
colors
is
correct
while
the
other
is
not
,
the
identification
is
not
positive
.
if
the
colors
in
both
directions
are
bluishwhite
bluish
white
,
the
analyst
has
chosen
a
matching
index
oil
which
is
higher
than
the
correct
matching
oil
,
eg
.
the
analyst
has
used
n
=
=
1
620
where
chrysotile
is
present
.
the
next
lower
oil
(
section
35
)
should
be
used
to
prepare
another
specimen
.
if
the
color
in
both
directions
is
yellowwhite
yellow
white
to
strawyellowwhite
straw
yellow
white
,
this
indicates
that
the
index
of
the
oil
is
lower
than
the
index
of
the
fiber
,
eg
.
the
preparation
is
in
n
=
=
1
550
while
anthophyllite
is
present
.
select
the
next
higher
oil
(
section
35
)
and
prepare
another
slide
.
continue
in
this
fashion
until
a
positive
identification
of
all
asbestos
species
present
has
been
made
or
all
possible
asbestos
species
have
been
ruled
out
by
negative
results
in
this
test
.
certain
plant
fibers
can
have
similar
dispersion
colors
as
asbestos
.
take
care
to
note
and
evaluate
the
morphology
of
the
fibers
or
remove
the
plant
fibers
in
prepreparation
preparation
.
coating
material
on
the
fibers
such
as
carbonate
or
vinyl
may
destroy
the
dispersion
color
.
usually
,
there
will
be
some
outcropping
of
fiber
which
will
show
the
colors
sufficient
for
identification
.
when
this
is
not
the
case
,
treat
the
sample
as
described
in
section
33
.
and
then
perform
dispersion
staining
.
some
samples
will
yield
to
becke
line
analysis
if
they
are
coated
or
electron
microscopy
can
be
used
for
identification
.
