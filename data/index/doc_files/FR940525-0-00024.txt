of
the
federal
food

establish
tolerances
for

the
agency
established
these
tolerances
with
an
expiration
date
of
09/30/1994
,
to
cover
residues
expected
to
be
present
from
use
during
the
period
of
conditional
registration
for
these
uses
.
the
conditional
registrations
were
to
expire
09/30/1993
.
the
agency
recently
extended
the
conditional
registration
expiration
date
to
12/31/1994
.
the
conditional
registration
required
the
following
information
to
be
submitted
.
these
studies
were
required
because
the
chronic
risk
of
clofentezine
to
avian
and
aquatic
species
could
not
be
fully
evaluated
.

.
avian
reproduction

required

two
aquatic
studies
,
an
aquatic
invertebrate
lifecycle

cycle
study
and
a
fish

study
,
were
required
.
studies
have
been
submitted
and
are
currently
in
review
,
but
a
final
review
is
not
expected
to
be
completed
for
some
time
.
however
,
the
agency
has
conducted
a
preliminary
review
of
these
studies
and
determined
that
they
are
scientifically
sound
.
therefore
,
on
the
basis
of
norams
nor
ams
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
the
conditional
registration
,
the
agency
is
removing
the
expiration
date
for
the
tolerances
of
the
commodities
listed

.
in
the
interim
,
until
the
agency
is
able
to
complete
its
final
review
and
risk
assessment
a

will
remain

in

the

to
make
the
tolerances
permanent
for

no

as
described

the

decided
to

these
tolerances

the

the

the

determined
that
the

the

there
