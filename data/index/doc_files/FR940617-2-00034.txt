of

of
phigs
should
be
used
only
when
the

cannot
reasonably
be
implemented
with
the
standard

alone
.
although
nonstandard
features
can
be
very
useful
,
it
should
be
recognized
that
the
use
of
these
or
any
other
nonstandard

may
make
the
interchange
of
graphics
programs
and
future

more
difficult
and

of

subsequent

including
those

will
be
added
periodically
as
they
become

as
these

each

will
become

implementation
of
this

involves
four
areas
of
consideration
:
the
effective
date
,
acquisition
of
phigs
software
system
implementations
,
interpretations
of
phigs
implementations
,
and
validation
of
phigs

effective

this
revised
standard
is
effective
six
(

months
after
approval
by
the
secretary
of
commerce
.
requirements
for
the
use
of

are
unchanged
and
continue
in
effect
.
validation
of

is
required
after
the
effective

in
