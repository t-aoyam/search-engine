the
committee
pointed
out
that
the
general
industry
standard
requires
lunch
rooms
,
while
the
construction
standard
requires
lunch
areas
,
and
that
areas
were
sufficient
.
osha
agrees
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
build
lunchrooms
in
shipyard
facilities
,
so
long
as
the
area
provided
for
food
consumption
is
not
so
close
to
the
work
area
that
asbestos
contamination
is
likely
.
in
that
case
,
areas
are
insufficient
and
an
enclosed
room
must
be
provided
which
is
free
of
contamination
.

the
`
communication
of
hazards
'
provisions
of
the
standards
contain
many
revisions
.
the
court
in
1988
had
remanded
two
information
transfer
issues
for
oshas
reconsideration
.
these
were
to
extend
the
reporting
and
information
transfer
requirements
and
to
require
construction
employers
to
notify
osha
of
asbestos
work
.
as
discussed
earlier
,
osha
has
decided
not
to
require
general
prejob
job
notification
to
the
agency
.
however
,
the
agency
has
expanded
required
notifications
among
owners
,
employers
and
employees
.
basically
,
the
general
industry
standard
has
been
upgraded
to
the
more
extensive
notification
requirements
of
the
construction
standard
and
the
shipyard
employment
standards
.
consequently
this
preamble
section
discusses
the
issues
together
.
in
the
shipyard
standard
the
`
building
owner
'
may
be
a
vessel
owner
or
a
building
owner
.
osha
notes
that
in
shipyards
vessels
undergoing
repair
may
be
owned
by
foreign
entities
,
as
well
as
by
entities
subject
to
the
acts
jurisdiction
.
when
a
foreignowned
foreign
owned
vessel
is
repaired
in
an
american
shipyard
,
the
employer
(
either
the
shipyard
or
an
outside
contractor
)
must
either
treat
materials
defined
as
pacm
as
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
or
sample
the
suspect
material
and
analyze
it
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
contains
asbestos
.
an
overview
of
these
revisions
follows
.
the
construction
and
shipyard
standards
now
require
that
employers
who
discover
the
presence
of
material
which
is
acm
or
is
presumed
acm
(
pacm
)
on
the
worksite
,
must
notify
the
project
or
building
owner
.
on
worksites
having
multiemployers
employers
,
the
person
who
discovers
the
material
also
is
to
notify
the
other
employers
.
an
employer
on
a
multiemployer
employer
worksite
who
is
planning
class
i
or
class
ii
asbestos
work
is
to
inform
all
the
other
employers
on
the
site
of
the
presence
of
acm
to
which
employees
of
those
employers
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
exposed
.
they
are
to
be
informed
of
the
location
and
quantity
of
these
materials
and
the
measures
to
be
taken
to
protect
them
from
exposure
.
the
1986
construction
standard
required
employers
to
notify
other
employers
on
multiemployer
employer
worksites
of
the
existence
and
location
of
asbestos
work
,
but
was
silent
on
the
notification
role
of
building
owners
.
osha
was
concerned
that
building
owners
were
`
outside
the
domain
of
the
osh
act
'
as
noted
above
,
this
is
a
specific
issue
remanded
for
reconsideration
by
the
court
of
appeals
.
now
,
upon
reconsideration
,
osha
believes
that
it
has
authority
to
require
building
owners
[
as
defined
in
paragraph
(
b
]
who
are
statutory
employers
,
to
take
necessary
and
appropriate
action
to
protect
employees
other
than
their
own
.
in
the
1990
proposal
osha
pointed
to
other
standards
in
which
it
has
required
building
owners
and
other
employers
who
are
not
the
direct
employers
of
the
employees
exposed
to
particular
hazards
,
to
warn
of
defects
,
take
remedial
action
,
or
provide
information
to
the
directly
employing
employer
.
it
cited
the
hazard
communication
standards
requirement
that
manufacturers
provide
information
to
downstream
employers
(
29
cfr
1910
1200
)
and
the
powered
platform
standard
which
requires
the
building
owner
to
assure
the
contract
employer
that
the
building
and
equipment
conform
to
specified
design
criteria
as
examples
(
29
cfr
1910
66
)
osha
believes
that
the
building
or
project
owner
is
the
best
and
often
the
only
source
of
information
concerning
the
location
of
asbestos
installed
in
structures
;
therefore
,
osha
is
requiring
the
owner
to
receive
,
maintain
,
and
communicate
knowledge
of
the
location
and
amount
of
acm
or
pacm
to
employers
of
employees
who
may
be
exposed
.
osha
acknowledges
that
in
shipyards
,
foreign
vessel
owners
are
not
`
statutory
employers
'
and
thus
,
are
not
covered
by
these
standards
.
in
such
cases
,
the
employer
performing
the
`
refit
'
must
either
presume
that
tsi
and
surfacing
material
are
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
,
or
have
the
material
tested
.
when
turnaround
turn
around
time
must
be
minimized
,
the
case
in
many
overhauls
,
osha
expects
that
the
jobs
will
be
performed
in
conformity
with
this
standard
without
testing
.
the
final
rule
provides
a
comprehensive
notification
scheme
for
affected
partiesbuilding
owners
,
contract
employers
and
employees
,
which
will
assure
that
information
concerning
the
presence
,
location
,
and
quantity
of
acm
or
pacm
in
buildings
is
communicated
in
a
timely
manner
to
protect
employees
who
work
with
or
in
the
vicinity
of
such
materials
.
before
class
i
,
ii
,
or
iii
work
is
initiated
,
building
and
or
project
owners
must
notify
their
own
employees
and
employers
who
are
bidding
on
such
work
,
of
the
quantity
and
location
of
acm
and
pacm
present
in
such
areas
.
owners
also
must
notify
their
own
employees
who
work
in
or
adjacent
to
such
jobs
.
