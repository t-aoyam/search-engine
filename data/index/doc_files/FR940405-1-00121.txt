proposed
paragraph
(

)
establishes
requirements
dealing
with
outdoor
air
pollutants
and
contaminants
emitted
locally
within

.
this
paragraph
proposes
to
require
the
employer
to
implement
measures
to
restrict
the
entry
of
outdoor
air
pollutants
into
the
building
and
to
control
local
indoor
sources
of

emissions
by
employing
other
control
measures
like

proposed
paragraph
(

)
proposes
to
require
the
control
of
microbial
contamination
by
routinely
inspecting
for
and
repairing
water
leaks
that
can
promote
growth
of
biologic
agents
,
by
promptly
drying
,
replacing
,
removing

or
cleaning
damp
or
wet
materials
;
and
by
taking
measures
to
remove
visible
microbial
contamination
in
ductwork
,
humidifiers
,
other
hvac
system
components
,
or
on
other
building
surfaces
.
proposed
paragraph
(
e4
)
addresses
the
use
of
cleaning
and
maintenance
chemicals
,
pesticides
and
other
hazardous
chemicals
.
pesticides
must
be
used
according
to
manufacturers
'
recommendations
,
and
where
chemicals
are
to
be
used
,
employees
in
those
areas
affected
are
to
be
informed
,
at
least
within
24
hours
prior
to
use

of
the
type
of
chemical
to
be
applied
.
the
provisions
proposed
under
(
e2
)
are
intended
to
ensure
that
indoor
air
quality
is
not
degraded
as
a
result
of
entry
of
outdoor
contaminants
,
such
as
vehicle
exhaust
,
or
by
circulation
of
contaminants
generated
within
the
building
.
the
agency
believes
that
,
where
necessary
,
entry
of
outdoor
air
pollutants
can
be
restricted
by
eliminating
or
repositioning
entry
points
into
the
building
.
indoor
local
contaminant
emissions
can
be
minimized
where
necessary
,
through
application
of
control
measures
such
as
source
substitution
and
engineering
controls
that
may
include
local
source
capture
exhaust
ventilation
.
collection
of
contaminants
at
their
source
of
emission
through
engineering
controls
is
an
accepted
basic
principle
of
industrial
hygiene
.
equipment
and
processes
which
are
located
or
take
place
in
areas
that
may
lead
to
contamination
of
other
areas
should
be
provided
with
engineering
controls
,
where
necessary
and
feasible
.
the
provisions
proposed
in
paragraph
(
e3
)
are
intended
to
limit
the
opportunity
for
microbiological
contamination
of
building
systems
and
structures
.
although
individual
microbes
are
not
visible
to
the
naked
eye
,
colonies
of
microbes
are
.
moisture
can
lead
to
microbiological
growth
in
indoor
spaces
,
within
hvac
systems
,
or
within
building
structures
,
and
thus
to
a
variety
of
detrimental
health
effects
.
the
employer
therefore
,
is
required
to
take
preventive
and
corrective
actions
to
minimize
microbiological
growth
.
preventive
action
includes
routine
inspection
for
biological
growth
,
with
required
corrective
actions
such
as
repairing
water
leaks
,
drying
,
replacing
,
or
cleaning
wet
materials
,
and
removal
of
visible
microbiological
growth

the
provisions
proposed
in
paragraph
(

are
intended
to
restrict
indoor
exposure
to
hazardous
substances
such
as
pesticides
and
chemicals
used
for
cleaning
and
maintenance
purposes
.
the
agency
believes
that
proper
use
of
such
substances
is
important
to
limit
incidental
exposures
to
those
performing
cleaning
and
maintenance
as
well
as
to
other
employees
who
might
be
incidentally
exposed
.
manufacturers

for
use
of
these
products
often
address
aspects
of
ventilation
,
employee
protection
,
occupancy

,
and
other
protective
measures
.
thus
,
the
agency
has
proposed
to
require
that
chemicals
covered
under
this
paragraph
must
be
used
in
accordance
with
manufacturers
recommendations
.
to
further
limit
the
potential
for

the

of

the

are
intended

a
manner
that
will
reduce
the
potential
for
air

generated

.
such
activities
which
may
involve
demolition
,
sanding
,
surface
refinishing
,

removal

,
etc
.
can
result
in
hazardous
substance
emission
from

,

,
etc
.
and
can
also
produce
high
levels
of

to
control

,
the
standard
proposes
to
require
employers
to
develop
a
workplan
for
the
implementation
of
appropriate
work
procedures

controls
such
as

,
or
use
of

finally
,
paragraph

proposes
to
require

of
employees
in
the
vicinity
of
renovation

remodeling
activities
who
may
be
subject
to
incidental
exposure
to
emissions
produced
during
such
activities
(
ex

.
this
notification
must
also
apprise
affected
employees
of
the
potential
adverse
impact
on

informing
employees
of
potential
workplace
hazards
is
felt
by
the
agency
to
be
imperative
for
the
success
of
any
safety
and
health
program

believes
that

can
do
much
to
protect
themselves
if

they
