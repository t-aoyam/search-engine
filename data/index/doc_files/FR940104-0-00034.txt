(

(
hereinafter
referred
to
as
`
the
health

that
document
proposed
to
establish
general
requirements
pertaining
to
the
use
of
health
claims
that
characterize
the
relationship
of
a
food
component

healthrelated
health

condition
on
the
labels
and
in
labeling
of
both
foods
in
conventional

the
health

proposal
contained
definitions
to
clarify
the
meaning
of
specific
terms
used
in
the
regulations
,
preliminary
requirements
that
a
component
of
food
must
meet
to

that
are
permitted

and

also
,
the
health

proposal
contained
provisions
pertaining

the
required
content

in
response
to
the
health

,
fda
received
over

the

summarized
and
addressed
the
issues
raised
in
the
comments
in
the
final
rule
on

that
published
in

the

final
rule
became
effective
on
05/08/1993
.
although
the
health
claims
proposal
pertained
to
dietary
supplements
as
well
as
foods
in
conventional

form
,
the
final
rule
applied
only
to
the
latter
type
of

congress
passed
the

which
imposed
a
moratorium
on
fda
implementation
of
the
1990

with
respect
to
dietary
supplements
until
12/15/1993

fda
was
to
have
issued
proposed

that

the

is
to
issue
final
rules
based
on
these

the

also
amends
the

reflect
the
fact
that

does
not
issue
final
rules
with
respect
to
health
claims
for
dietary
supplements
by
12/31/1993

the

the

not

specific
procedure

of

the
establishment
of

thus
,
in
the
dietary
supplement
health
claims
proposal
(
58
fr

at

,
fda
reviewed
the
legislative
history
of
the
1990
amendments
to
identify
the
features
that
congress
intended
would
guide
the
agencys
choice
of
a
scientific
standard
and
procedure
for
regulating
health
claims
on
dietary
supplements
.
fda
identified
the
following
features
that
it
believes
should
guide
its
choice
:
o
the
regulations
are
to
deal
only
with
the
procedure
and
standard
for
health
claims
for
the
substances
in
dietary
supplements
.
they
are
to
have
no
bearing
on
the
availability
of
any
dietary
supplements
.
o
the
regulations
must
prohibit
the
use
of
health
claims
that
are
not
authorized
under
their
provisions
.
o
the
regulations
must
ensure
that
any
health
claims
that
appear
in
labeling
are
scientifically
valid
.
o
the
regulations
must
ensure
that
any
health
claims
that
appear
in
labeling
are
understandable
.
o
the
regulations
should
be
such
that
all
segments
of
the
food
industry
are
treated
fairly
and
in
a
consistent
manner
,
unless
there
is
an
appropriate
basis
on
which
to
draw
a
distinction
.
this
factor
embodies
a
principle
of
equity
implicitly
in
the
act
.
(
58
fr
33700
at
33703
)
with
these
features
in
mind
,
fda
considered
all
of
the
approaches
of
which
it
was
aware
that
might
be
used
to
regulate
dietary
supplements
.
the
agency
tentatively
concluded
that
it
should
adopt
an
approach
that
would
subject
dietary
supplements
to
the
same
standard
that
applies
to
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
fda
stated
that
it
was
its
tentative
view
that
that
approach
strikes
the
appropriate
balance
between
the
congressional
concern
for
consumer
fraud
,
public
health
,
and
sound
science
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
desire
to
provide
the
consumer
with
information
on
the
other
.
furthermore
,
the
agency
advised
that
if
it
adopts
this
standard
for
dietary
supplements
,
all
foods
will
be
regulated
under
the
same
standard
.
fda
pointed
out
that
under
the
same
procedure
that
applies
with
respect
to
claims
for
substances
in
food
in
conventional
food
form
,
there
is
a
premarket
review
that
ensures
that
the
safety
of
the
substance
that
is
to
be
the
subject
of
the
claim
has
been
established
as
well
as
the
scientific
validity
of
the
claim
.
a
claim
linking
a
substance
to
a
disease
,
whether
on
a
food
in
conventional
food
form
or
on
a
dietary
supplement
,
is
intended
to
increase
intake
of
that
substance
.
thus
,
the
agency
said
,
it
is
important
to
ensure
that
a
claim
encouraging
such
increased
intake
can
be
safely
implemented
.
therefore
,
fda
proposed
to
adopt
the
same
procedure
for
health
claims
for
dietary
supplements
as
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form

a
great
many
comments
,
primarily
from
consumers
,
raised
objections
that
indicated
that
the
commenters
were
misinformed
about
the
proposed
regulations
,
or
that
they
simply
did
not
believe
what
fda
stated
in
the
dietary
supplement
proposal
.
many
of
the
comments
expressed
considerable
anger
,
resentment
,
and
even
fear
over
the
proposal
.
a
large
number
of
these
comments
characterized
the
proposal
as
an
attack
against
the
dietary
supplement
industry
.
many
of
these
comments
stated
that
fda
is
plotting
to
ban
all
dietary
supplements
.
a
number
of
comments
explained
that
the
proposed
regulations
would
limit
the
number
of
dietary
supplements
available
to
consumers
by
limiting
the
amount
of
health
information
that
could
appear
on
supplement
labels
and
thus
diminish
supplements
'
marketability
.
the
comments
maintained
that
fdas
proposed
policy
of
requiring
premarket
review
of
a
supplements
safety
is
contrary
to
the
agencys
stated
intent
to
preserve
supplement
availability
and
consumer
choice
.
some
of
the
comments
maintained
that
many
manufacturers
would
be
put
out
of
business
.
many
of
the
comments
argued
that
the
nations
health
would
be
adversely
affected
,
and
that
health
care
costs
would
increase
without
dietary
supplements
to
maintain
good
health
.
some
comments
contained
testimonials
that
certain
dietary
supplements
were
responsible
for
curing
and
preventing
a
variety
of
diseases
,
including
cancer
.
however
,
a
few
comments
pointed
out
that
assertions
that
fda
plans
to
ban
dietary
supplements
are
unfounded
.
a
number
of
these
comments
predicted
that
the
vast
majority
of
dietary
supplements
will
remain
in
the
marketplace
because
about
80
percent
of
supplement
labels
are
already
in
compliance
with
the
proposed
provisions
.
there
is
no
basis
for
virtually
all
of
the
concerns
raised
in
the
comments
about
the
availability
of
dietary
supplements
.
nothing
in
these
regulations
will
make
them
unavailable
to
consumers
.
these
regulations
focus
only
on
ensuring
that
health
claims
,
if
made
on
the
labels
or
in
the
labeling
of
dietary
supplements
,
are
scientifically
valid
and
understandable
.
thus
,
the
availability
of
dietary
supplements
will
not
be
affected
by
these
regulations
.
while
it
is
likely
that
some
claims
may
have
to
be
removed
from
product
labeling
as
a
result
of
this
final
rule
,
the
products
themselves
can
continue
to
be
marketed
.
it
is
true
that
prohibiting
the
use
of
claims
that
have
not
been
authorized
by
fda
may
have
an
adverse
impact
on
the
marketability
of
some
products
.
however
,
any
such
impact
is
outweighed
by
the
need
to
assure
consumers
that
the
claims
that
are
made
in
labeling
are
scientifically
valid
,
and
that
they
can
rely
on
such
claims
.
in
fact
,
the
only
products
whose
marketability
will
ultimately
suffer
under
these
regulations
will
be
those
whose
labeling
has
borne
claims
that
cannot
be
supported
by
the
available
scientific
evidence
.
the
requirement
that
the
agency
be
confident
that
the
presence
of
a
health
claim
will
not
result
in
unsafe
intakes
of
the
substance
that
is
the
subject
of
the
claim
is
not
inconsistent
with
supplement
availability
and
consumer
choice
.
if
a
manufacturer
does
not
choose
to
make
a
claim
about
a
substance
,
nothing
in
these
regulations
will
affect
the
manufacturers
ability
to
continue
to
market
supplements
that
contain
that
substance
.
fda
believes
,
however
,
that
it
has
an
obligation
to
ensure
that
before
it
authorizes
a
claim
that
encourages
consumers
to
increase
their
consumption
of
a
substance
,
it
have
some
assurance
that
increased
consumption
of
that
substance
will
not
be
harmful
.

.
fair
and
consistent
treatment
of
all
segments
of
the
food
industry
2
.
many
comments
asserted
that
fda
has
not
been
evenhanded
in
its
approval
of
health
claims
for
use
on
dietary
supplements
and
on
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
some
of
these
comments
maintained
that
fdas
unfair
treatment
of
dietary
supplements
is
evidenced
by
the
agencys
approval
of
health
claims
involving
cancer
and
coronary
heart
disease
for
use
on
fruits
,
vegetables
,
and
grain
products
but
not
for
use
on
fortified
foods
or
supplements
that
provide
fiber
or
antioxidant
vitamins
.
the
comments
stated
that
fda
should
authorize
health
claims
involving
particular
nutrients
for
use
on
any
food
that
contains
those
nutrients
,
including
dietary
supplements
,
unless
there
is
significant
scientific
agreement
that
the
claim
is
valid
only
when
the
nutrient
is
consumed
in
a
particular
form
.
to
ensure
that
such
an
approach
is
taken
in
evaluating
health
claims
for
use
on
dietary
supplements
in
the
future
,
a
few
comments
requested
that

a
few
comments
contended
that
fda
also
has
treated
dietary
supplements
unfairly
by
withholding
approval
of
a
health
claim
concerning
the
role
of
folic
acid
in
reducing
the
risk
of
neural
tube
defects
(
ntds
)
simply
because
of
its
concerns
that
allowing
the
claim
on
foods
in
conventional
food
form
would
raise
safety
issues
because
of
overfortification
of
the
food
supply
and
the
subsequent
effect
on
certain
subpopulations
.
these
comments
asserted
that
the
proper
course
of
action
for
the
agency
would
have
been
to
allow
health
claims
on
dietary
supplements
but
to
prohibit
their
use
on
foods
in
conventional
food
form
until
the
public
health
concerns
associated
with
such
use
had
been
resolved
.
however
,
a
few
comments
supported
fdas
decision
to
approve
particular
health
claims
for
use
on
fruits
,
vegetables
,
and
fibercontaining
fiber
containing
grains
while
not
authorizing
their
use
on
dietary
supplements
or
fortified
foods
with
added
antioxidant
vitamins
or
fiber
.
these
comments
noted
that
there
are
many
compounds
in
fruits
and
vegetables
that
may
be
involved
in
reducing
the
risk
of
disease
that
may
not
have
been
identified
.
the
comments
asserted
that
before
allowing
a
dietary
supplement
to
bear
a
health
claim
authorized
for
use
on
food
in
conventional
food
form
,
it
is
important
to
establish
that
the
supplement
provides
the
same
health
protection
benefits
as
the
conventional
food
.
fda
disagrees
with
the
assertions
in
the
comments
that
it
has
been
unfair
with
the
dietary
supplement
industry
with
respect
to
its
approval
of
specific
health
claims
.
fda
believes
that
the
health
claims
should
be
consistent
with
the
scientific
evidence
available
to
the
agency
.
in
the
federal
register
of
01/06/1993
(

,
and

fda
explained
why
it
was
authorizing
health
claims
pertaining
to
:
(

)
heart
disease
and
diets
low
in
saturated
fat
and
cholesterol
and
high
in

in

that
may
contain
fiber
,
vitamin
a
(
(
beta

)
and
vitamin

.
the
agency
also
explained
in
detail
why
it
was
not
authorizing
health
claims
pertaining
to
any
specific
nutrients
(
ie
,
heart
disease
and
dietary
fiber
,
cancer
and
dietary
fiber
,
and
cancer
and
antioxidant
vitamins
.
in
the
case
of
the
antioxidant
vitamins
,
fda
found
that
although
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
justify
a
health
claim
concerning
the
relationship
between
diets
low
in
fat
and
high
in
fruits
and
vegetables
that
may
contain
fiber
,
vitamin
a
,
and
vitamin
c
and
a
reduced
risk
of
cancer
,
the
available
evidence
did
not
provide
a
basis
on
which
to
attribute
the
reduction
in
risk
of
disease
to
any
individual
vitamin
or
combination
of
vitamins
,
regardless
of
whether
the
vitamin
is
classified
as
an
antioxidant
or
not
(
see
discussion
under
section
iv
,
58
fr

yet
,
because
of
the
usefulness
of
vitamins
a
(
as
beta
-
carotene
)
and
c
and
dietary
fiber
in
identifying
those
fruits
and
vegetables
that
correlate
with
reduced
cancer
risk
,
fda
identified
these
nutrients
as
being
characteristic
of
the
foods
associated
with
a
protective
effect
.
any
one
or
a
combination
of
these
three
nutrients
can
serve
as
the
identifying
marker
.
moreover
,
because
fruits
and
vegetables
are
also
characterized
by
an
absence
of
fat
,
and
because
of
the
identified
relationship
of
low
fat
diets
to
reduced
risk
of
cancer
,
fda
highlighted
low
fat
intakes
as
part
of
the
dietary
pattern
associated
with
decreased
cancer
risk
.
because
the
mechanism
of
the
protective
effect
of
fruits
and
vegetables
is
not
known
,
and
because
it
is
not
possible
to
determine
which
of
the
nutrients
or
other
components
in
fruits
and
vegetables
is
causing
the
observed
effect
,
the
health
claim
authorized
by
fda
focuses
on
fruits
and
vegetables
as
a
class
of
foods
and
their
relationship
to
cancer
risk
,
and
not
on
particular
nutrients
.
by
requiring
that
all
characterizing
nutrients
be
identified
as
characteristic
of
dietary
patterns
rich
in
fruits
and
vegetables
without
specifically
attributing
reduced
cancer
risk
to
a
single
nutrient
or
single
type
of
nutrient
(
antioxidant
vitamins
,
fda
made
the
claim
consistent
with
the
scientific
knowledge
available
to
it
at
the
time
it
authorized
the
claim
.
because
of
the
rapidly
evolving
science
base
relative
to
this
topic
,
however
,
fda
has
continued
to
update
its
evaluation
of
the
scientific
evidence
and
the
degree
of
scientific
agreement
on
the
relationship
between
antioxidant
vitamins
and
cancer
.
as
part
of
these
efforts
,
fda
initiated
,
along
with
other
major
research
and
health
organizations
as
cosponsors
,
a
public
conference
on
antioxidant
vitamins
and
cancer
and
cardiovascular
disease
that
was
held
on
november
1
through

,
1993
.
the
transcript
of
that
meeting
has
been
submitted
to
the
docket
as
a
comment
on
the
antioxidant
vitamins
and
cancer
rulemaking
,
along
with
other
comments
received
in
response
to
the
announcement
of
the
conference
(
58

,

.
fda
is
reviewing
the
results
of
this
conference
and
other
scientific
evidence
that
has
become
publicly
available
since
the
publication
of
the

final
rule
on
antioxidant
vitamins
and
cancer
.
similarly
,
in
the
case
of
heart
disease
and
dietary
fiber
and
of
cancer
and
dietary
fiber
,
the
agency
found
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
attribute
the
reduction
in
risk
specifically
to
dietary
fiber
or
to
specific
fiber
components
.
the
agency
did
conclude
,
however
,
that
dietary
fiber
and
soluble
fiber
,
along
with
other
nutrients
,
serve
as
useful
markers
in
identifying
those
foods
for
which
the
scientific
evidence
showed
that
inclusion
in
a
daily
diet
was
associated
with
reduced
risk
of
cancer
and
of
heart
disease
(
58
fr
2552
and
58
fr
2537
.
for
both
topic
areas
,
the
agency
also
noted
the
inability
of
commonly
used
analytical
methodologies
to
detect
many
of
the
characteristics
that
vary
among
dietary
fibers
and
that
may
be
related
to
biological
function
(
eg
,
particle
size
,
chemical
composition
,
waterholding
water
holding
capacity
.
with
regard
to
heart
disease
,
other
components
variable
associated
with
soluble
fiber
in
foods
(
eg
,
lipid
components
)
may
also
contribute
to
a
cholesterollowering
cholesterol
lowering
effect
.
fda
found
that
the
inability
to
detect
many
of
the
differences
among
fibers
,
fiber
components
,
and
other
substances
in
foods
that
contain
dietary
fibers
,
including
soluble
fiber
,
and
the
general
lack
of
conclusions
as
to
the
mechanism
of
action
of
dietary
fibers
and
fiber
components
were
limiting
factors
on
fdas
ability
to
draw
conclusions
from
the
available
evidence
.
furthermore
,
fda
noted
that
foods
high
in
dietary
fiber
are
also
generally
low
in
calories
and
total
fat
,
factors
that
are
associated
with
reduced
risk
of
cancer
.
fiberrich
fiber
rich
foods
are
also
generally
low
in
saturated
fats
and
cholesterol
,
substances
that
also
affect
the
risk
of
developing
heart
disease
.
thus
,
some
or
all
of
the
benefits
associated
with
diets
high
in
fiberrich
fiber
rich
foods
could
be
the
result
of
displacement
of
fat
and
saturated
fat
from
the
total
diet
rather
than
an
effect
of
fiber
per
se
.
the
agency
stated
that
although
the
specific
roles
of
the
numerous
potentially
protective
substances
or
displacement
of
negative
substances
(
eg
,
fat
,
saturated
fat
,
and
cholesterol
)
in
such
plant
foods
are
not
yet
understood
,
populations
with
diets
rich
in
these
foods
experience
many
health
advantages
,
including
lower
rates
of
heart
disease
and
cancer
.
thus
,
fda
did
not
authorize
the
use
of
a
health
claim
on
the
association
between
ingestion
of
dietary
fiber
,
or
specific
fiber
components
,
and
a
reduced
risk
of
heart
disease
or
cancer
.
instead
,
for
cancer
,
fda
,
to
be
consistent
with
the
available
scientific
evidence
and
prevailing
scientific
agreement
,
focused
on
fibercontaining
fiber
containing
grain
products
,
fruits
,
and
vegetables
as
product
classes
.
similarly
,
for
heart
disease
,
fda
focused
on
fruits
,
vegetables
,
and
grain
products
that
contain
fiber
,
particularly
soluble
fiber
.
because
of
the
usefulness
of
dietary
fiber
or
soluble
fiber
in
identifying
the
types
of
foods
whose
consumption
is
most
likely
to
correlate
with
decreased
cancer
or
heart
disease
risk
,
these
substances
can
serve
as
identifying
markers
for
selecting
useful
foods
,
even
in
the
absence
of
adequate
evidence
of
a
direct
effect
of
fiber
.
fda
is
aware
,
however
,
of
the
rapidly
evolving
nature
of
the
science
base
relative
to
these
topic
areas
.
fda
intends
to
update
its
review
of
the
science
by
initiating
,
in
the
near
future
,
along
with
other
major
research
and
health
organizations
as
cosponsors
,
a
public
symposium
on
dietary
fiber
and
heart
disease
and
cancer
.
with
respect
to
assertions
concerning
folic
acid
,
fda
disagrees
that
it
should
have
allowed
health
claims
on
dietary
supplements
while
prohibiting
their
use
on
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
while
fda
did
not
authorize
a
health
claim
for
folic
acid
and
ntds
,
in
the
final
rule
on
heath
claims
and
label
statements
for
folic
acid
and
ntds
published
in
the
federal
register
of
01/06/1993
(
58
fr
2606
)
(
hereinafter
referred
to
as
`
the
folic
acid
final
rule
,
the
agency
did
announce
its
plans
to
work
expeditiously
to
authorize
a
claim
,
if
appropriate
.
the
agency
noted
that
the
public
health
service
(
phs
,
including
fda
,
had
recommended
(
ref
.

)
that
all
women
of
childbearing
age
in
the
united
states
should
consume
04
milligram
(
mg
)
(
400
micrograms
(
mug
)
of
folic
acid
daily
to
reduce
their
risk
of
having
a
pregnancy
affected
with
spina
bifida
or
other
neural
tube
defects
.
fda
acknowledges
that
this
recommendation
evidenced
that
significant
scientific
agreement
existed
regarding
a
relationship
between
folate
and
ntds
but
said
that
there
were
factors
that
prevented
fda
from
authorizing
a
claim
.
the
agency
said
that
the
act
must
be
read
as
a
whole
,
and
that
sections
403r3aii
)
and
409
of
the
act
(
21
usc
.
348
)
reflect
the
proposition
that
the
use
of
a
substance
that
is
the
subject
of
a
health
claim
must
be
safe
.
the
agency
pointed
out
that
the
phs
recommendation
stated
that
there
were
significant
questions
that
persist
about
the
safe
use
of
folic
acid
in
food
.
as
stated
in
the
folic
acid
final
rule
,
fda
expected
that
the
authorization
of
a
claim
would
likely
result
in
significant
increases
in
consumption
of
folic
acid
by
women
in
their
childbearing
years
and
by
the
general
population
,
because
manufacturers
would
add
folic
acid
to
their
products
in
order
to
claim
that
these
products
were
useful
in
reducing
the
risk
of
birth
defects
.
intakes
of
multiple
doses
of
folic
acid
from
supplements
and
from
its
increased
presence
in
the
food
supply
could
rapidly
result
in
intakes
of
3
to
7
mg
(
3000
to
7000
&
mug
)
per
day
(
58
fr
2606
at
2614
.
such
intakes
represent
increases
of
10fold
fold
or
more
above
current
intakes
.
in
the
folic
acid
final
rule
,
the
agency
reviewed
the
safety
considerations
raised
by
such
increases
in
folic
acid
intakes
,
including
:
(
1
)
potential
effects
in
persons
with
poor
vitamin
b12
status
;
(
2
)
potential
risks
for
persons
taking
medications
that
interfere
with
folate
metabolism
;
(
3
)
potential
risks
for
pregnant
women
because
of
uncertainties
about
effects
of
high
blood
levels
of
folic
acid
on
the
embryo
during
gestation
;
and
(
4
)
uncertainties
regarding
possible
interactions
between
folic
acid
and
other
nutrients
with
increased
folic
acid
intakes
.
the
agency
concluded
that
it
could
not
authorize
a
health
claim
on
folic
acid
until
the
questions
regarding
the
safe
use
of
this
nutrient
were
satisfactorily
resolved
.
in
the
folic
acid
final
rule
the
agency
described
the
efforts
it
was
undertaking
to
address
and
resolve
these
concerns
.
following
publication
of
this
document
,
based
on
its
review
of
the
evidence
,
its
discussions
with
an
advisory
committee
,
and
its
review
of
the
comments
that
it
received
,
the
agency
tentatively
concluded
that
the
safety
problems
raised
by
folic
acid
can
be
resolved
by
setting
a
safe
upper
limit
of
intake
of
1
mg
folate
per
day
for
all
population
groups
.
the
agency
announced
its
tentative
conclusion
in
a
proposal
to
authorize
a
health
claim
on
folate
and
neural
tube
defects
(
58
fr
53254
,
10/14/1993
.
in
companion
documents
,
fda
also
proposed
to
amend
the
food
additive
regulation
for
folic
acid
to
specify
the
foods
that
could
be
fortified
with
folic
acid
and
the
level
at
which
they
could
be
fortified
(
58
fr
53312
)
and
to
amend
the
standards
of
identity
for
specific
cerealgrain
cereal
grain
products
to
permit
the
addition
of
folic
acid
(
58
fr
53305
.
thus
,
based
on
this
review
of
the
agencys
actions
,
it
is
clear
that
the
nondiscriminatory
provision
suggested
in
the
comments
is
not
necessary
.
when
fda
has
concluded
that
a
substance
has
a
relationship
to
a
disease
,
fda
has
acted
to
authorize
a
claim
(
see
final
rule
on
calcium
and

and

proposed

in
the
case
of

and
cancer
,

heart
disease
,
and
dietary
fiber
and
cancer
,
the
evidence
did
not
establish
that
the
named
substances
had
an
effect
on
the
named
diseases
.
the
evidence
showed
that
these
nutrients
were
merely
markers
of
foods
that
had
been
shown
in
studies
to
affect
the
risk
of
the
disease
.
fda
has
reflected
the
scientific
evidence
in
the
claims
that
it
has
authorized
and
proposed
to
authorize
.
any
other
course
of
action
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
act
because
it
would
result
in
claims
that
were
both
not
scientifically
valid
and
misleading
.

alternative
approaches
in
the
dietary

health
claims
proposal
(
58
fr
33700
at

,
fda
advised
that
a
variety
of
approaches
had
come
to
fdas
attention
about
how
health
claims
for
dietary
supplements
would
best
be
regulated
under
the
1990
amendments
.
these
approaches
came
to
the
agencys
attention
by
various
means
,
including
the
comments
on
the
health

proposal
that
addressed
the
most
appropriate
method
for
regulating
dietary
supplements
,
testimony
before
congress
about
implementation
of

,
as
well
as
the
legislative
history
of

.
fda
carefully
evaluated
each
of
these
approaches
to

use

(

at

,
fda
advised
that
it
had
tentatively
decided
not
to
adopt
a
committeebased
committee
based
approach
suggested
in
comments
for
evaluating
the
validity
of
health
claims
on
herbs
.
this
approach
,
known
as
the
botanical
ingredient
review
(
bir
,
would
involve
the
establishment
of
expert
panels
under
the
direction
of
an
oversight
committee
.
fda
would
participate
as
a
nonvoting
member
of
the
expert
panels
.
the
oversight
committee
,
which
would
be
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
reviewing
all
health
claim
petitions
pertaining
to
herb
or
botanical
components
,
would
relieve
fda
of
all
responsibility
for
initial
review
of
these
petitions
.
each
expert
panel
would
conduct
an
evaluation
of
scientific
data
pertaining
to
the
requested
claim
,
subject
the
evaluation
to
peer
review
,
and
prepare
a
final
recommendation
about
the
claim
.
the
recommendation
and
all
supporting
documents
would
then
be
forwarded
to
fda
,
and
the
agency
would
be
permitted
120
days
to
approve
,
disapprove
,
or
modify
the
report
.
under
draft
regulations
prepared
and
submitted
for
fda
adoption
by
one
comment
on
the
health
claims
proposal
,
there
would
be
a
codified
presumption
in
favor
of
the
committee
recommendation
.
the
agency
based
its
tentative
decision
about
the
bir
on
its
belief
that
the
suggested
approach
would
involve
a
significant
transfer
of
agency
authority
on
health
claims
because
of
this
presumption
in
the
draft
regulations
submitted
by
the
comment
.
under
this
presumption
,
fda
would
be
obligated
to
prove
that
the
committee
was
wrong
if
the
agency
decided
not
to
follow
the
committees
recommendation
.
in
such
circumstances
,
fda
could
be
forced
to
propose
to
authorize
health
claims
that
it
was
not
satisfied
were
scientifically
valid
.
fda
noted
that
there
is
no
basis
under
the
act
for
such
a
transfer
.
also
,
the
agency
noted
that
the
creation
of
such
a
committee
would
be
financially
burdensome
and
stated
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
commit
its
limited
resources
to
a
committee
with
as
narrow
a
scope
as
that
suggested
by
the
comment
.

a
few
comments
addressed
this
advisory
committee
issue
.
some
comments
voiced
opposition
to
fdas
tentative
decision
not
to
establish
a
bir
.
these
comments
disputed
the
agencys
assertion
that
the
establishment
of
a
bir
would
involve
any
transfer
of
authority
,
noting
that
fda
would
retain
full
and
final
discretion
in
approving
health
claims
.
the
comments
also
disputed
fdas
finding
that
the
creation
of
a
bir
would
be
burdensome
and
costly
in
light
of
the
agencys
limited
resources
.
the
comments
stated
that
such
a
finding
is
inconsistent
with
fdas
current
use
of
advisory
committees
for
very
narrow
subject
matters
such
as
overthecounter
the
counter
(
otc
)
antiplaque
products
,
circulatory
system
medical
devices
,
and
drug
abuse
.
the
comments
stated
that
the
use
of
a
bir
to
help
screen
petitions
from
the
much
larger
herbal
products
industry
would
be
an
efficient
,
economical
,
and
scientifically
credible
way
to
ration
fdas
scarce
resources
and
would
also
help
fda
meet
statutorilyimposed
statutorily
imposed
deadlines
for
actions
on
petitions
that
it
might
not
otherwise
be
able
to
meet
.
the
comments
also
asserted
that
the
agencys
statement
that
it
has
the
`
ultimate
responsibility
to
determine
whether
the
petitionedfor
petitioned
for
health
claim
is
valid
'
implies
a
mistrust
of
the
integrity
of
the
bir
process
and
the
involved
scientists
and
reveals
an
agency
belief
that
it
is
the
only
authority
competent
to
judge
the
scientific
validity
of
health
claims
for
herbal
dietary
supplements
.
the
comments
disagreed
with
such
a
conclusion
and
argued
that
health
claim
petitions
will
only
receive
adequate
and
full
consideration
from
the
scientific
community
best
qualified
to
determine
whether
they
meet
the
significant
scientific
agreement
standard
set
by
congress
through
the
creation
of
a
bir
,
which
would
represent
the
most
competent
and
knowledgeable
body
in
a
field
that
remains
largely
esoteric
to
fda
.
one
of
these
comments
suggested
that
appropriate
selections
for
herbal
experts
panels
might
include
experienced
herbal
practitioners
who
are
familiar
with
potential
adverse
reactions
to
herbs
as
well
as
medical
practitioners
in
foreign
countries
where
herb
safety
has
been
studied
by
government
and
industry
panels
.
the
comment
stated
that
the
inclusion
of
foreign
medical
practitioners
would
be
especially
appropriate
during
the
evaluation
of
a
claim
whose
merits
are
agreed
upon
throughout
the
world
but
are
not
generally
recognized
in
the
united
states
,
such
as
in
the
case
of
using
peppermint
tea
for
its
soothing
or
carminative
effects
on
the
digestive
tract
.
however
,
one
comment
supported
the
agencys
tentative
decision
not
to
adopt
the
bir
process
.
the
comment
stated
that
fda
could
well
be
legally
liable
for
decisions
made
by
the
bir
that
were
later
shown
to
have
placed
the
public
health
at
risk
.
several
comments
called
for
fda
to
establish
an
advisory
committee
for
health
claims
for
dietary
supplements
where
the
committee
would
select
expert
panels
responsible
for
the
evaluation
of
proposed
health
claims
for
all
dietary
supplements
.
the
comments
suggested
that
the
expert
panels
should
be
composed
of
scientists
and
health
care
professionals
with
expertise
on
a
given
nutrientdisease
nutrient
disease
relationship
as
well
as
nonvoting
industry
and
consumer
representatives
.
these
comments
contended
that
one
reason
for
the
agencys
slowness
in
approving
a
health
claim
for
folic
acid
has
been
its
reliance
on
advisory
panels
that
were
not
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
research
in
the
area
and
who
had
to
be
educated
about
the
strength
of
the
evidence
before
they
could
act
.
some
of
these
comments
suggested
that
fda
could
retain
the
authority
to
reject
the
recommendations
of
the
committee
,
as
long
as
it
published
its
reasons
for
doing
so
.
another
comment
stated
that
both
the
dietary
supplement
industry
and
fda
have
been
slow
to
recognize
and
utilize
a
great
deal
of
research
that
has
been
done
in
the
area
of
nutrition
and
health
.
the
comment
attributed
this
slowness
to
a
gap
between
the
scientific
community
,
fda
,
and
the
dietary
supplement
industry
.
the
comment
suggested
that
in
order
to
close
this
gap
,
fda
should
form
a
committee
of
its
leading
scientists
to
meet
with
a
similar
industry
committee
every
3
to
6
months
,
or
as
required
,
to
discuss
the
latest
research
in
the
area
of
nutrition
and
health
published
in
highly
accredited
scientific
journals
so
that
the
research
could
be
used
to
create
and
support
health
claim
petitions
.
the
comment
suggested
that
when
the
agency
committee
and
the
industry
reach
an
agreement
on
the
data
,
fda
could
authorize
the
use
of
a
health
claim
on
the
nutrientdisease
nutrient
disease
relationship
on
which
there
is
agreement
.
fda
recognizes
that
advisory
committees
may
make
valuable
contributions
in
assisting
the
agency
to
evaluate
scientific
evidence
about
health
claims
in
certain
circumstances
.
for
example
,
the
folic
acid
subcommittee
of
the
food
advisory
committee
provided
valuable
recommendations
in
support
of
fda
proposing
to
authorize
a
health
claim
for
folic
acid
and
proposing
to
fortify
cerealgrain
cereal
grain
products
.
the
agency
intends
to
continue
its
use
of
advisory
committees
wherever
the
need
arises
.
fda
believes
,
however
,
that
it
should
retain
the
right
to
decide
when
the
use
of
an
advisory
committee
is
necessary
.
there
may
frequently
be
circumstances
in
which
evidence
establishes
that
use
of
advisory
committees
is
not
necessary
because
the
evidence
shows
that
the
claim
is
clearly
supported
or
clearly
not
supported
.
in
addition
,
if
the
agency
were
to
establish
a
standing
advisory
committee
for
health
claims
,
fda
would
want
it
to
have
a
broader
focus
than
just
dietary
supplements
.
fdas
view
is
that
claims
should
focus
on
the
substance
,
and
not
the
food
in
which
it
is
found
,
because
the
primary
issue
is
whether
the
substancedisease
substance
disease
relationship
has
been
established
.
thus
,
if
fda
were
to
establish
a
standing
advisory
committee
,
it
would
be
on
health
claims
in
general
.
although
a
number
of
comments
asserted
that
fda
lacks
knowledge
of
herbal
products
,
the
agency
believes
that
its
personnel
are
fully
competent
to
evaluate
properly
substantiated
petitions
concerning
health
claims
in
this
area
.
also
,
if
the
agency
were
to
decide
to
establish
an
advisory
committee
,
it
would
take
steps
to
ensure
that
the
membership
of
the
committee
had
the
necessary
expertise
,
including
pertinent
expertise
on
herbal
products
.
there
is
an
implication
in
some
of
the
comments
that
the
evaluation
of
the
scientific
evidence
supporting
a
claim
is
somehow
different
depending
on
the
substance
involved
.
in
fact
,
whether
a
claim
is
for
a
vitamin
,
mineral
,
herb
,
or
other
similar
nutritional
substance
,
including
fat
,
saturated
fat
,
and
cholesterol
,
the
skills
needed
for
evaluation
of
a
claim
are
basically
the
same
.
these
skills
are
found
in
epidemiologists
,
nutritionists
,
biostatisticians
,
clinicians
,
and
experts
in
the
disease
being
addressed
,
as
well
as
in
people
aware
of
how
the
substance
is
,
or
should
be
,
consumed
.
thus
,
fda
does
not
agree
with
the
implication
in
these
comments
.
fda
is
interested
in
having
communication
with
the
dietary
supplement
industry
.
however
,
the
agency
does
not
believe
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
communication
to
take
the
form
of
the
suggested
standing
committee
to
meet
with
a
similar
industry
committee
every
3
to
6
months
.
while
fda
believes
that
regular
communication
with
the
dietary
supplement
industry
is
likely
to
be
useful
,
the
process
by
which
health
claims
are
authorized
must
be
a
more
open
and
public
process
than
that
suggested
by
the
comment
.
certainly
the
1990
amendments
envisioned
a
public
process
for
claims
for
substances
in
foods
in
conventional
food
form
,
as
reflected
in
section
403r4
)
of
the
act
.
fda
has
been
presented
with
no
convincing
reason
why
a
similar
process
should
not
apply
to
claims
for
substances
in
dietary
supplements
.
furthermore
,
fda
continues
to
believe
that
the
bir
advisory
committee
approach
would
involve
a
significant
transfer
of
agency
authority
for
health
claims
,
even
though
comments
on
the
health
claims
proposal
and
the
dietary
supplement
health
claims
proposal
have
made
arguments
to
the
contrary
.
the
suggested
regulation
for
health
claims
that
was
submitted
to
fda
on
05/10/1991
,
and
referred
to
by
the
agency
in
the
proposals
that
it
has
issued
,
states
in
part
:
b
.
if
the
committee
determines
that
a
proposed
health
claim
is
appropriate
for
a
particular
herb
or
botanical
,
either
as
proposed
or
as
modified
by
the
committee
,
it
shall
forward
its
recommendations
)
to
fda
together
with
all
the
data
and
other
information
before
the
committee
when
it
made
its
decision
.
c
.
if
the
committee
determines
that
,
on
the
basis
of
the
data
,
and
other
information
before
it
,
the
proposed
health
claim
is
not
scientifically
justified
for
the
herb
or
botanical
,
it
shall
so
notify
the
proposer
.
the
proposer
may
then
direct
the
committee
to
forward
to
fda
all
the
information
before
the
committee
with
respect
to
the
proposal
together
with
its
conclusions
and
the
reasons
therefore
.
d
.
within
120
days
of
receipt
of
the
information
described
in
(
b
)
and
(
c
)
above
,
fda
shall
either
accept
the
recommendation
,
reject
it
,
or
modify
it
based
upon
the
agencys
independent
evaluation
with
analysis
and
reasons
for
rejection
or
modification
of
recommended
health
claims
.
in
arriving
at
its
decision
fda
may
consider
data
or
information
other
than
that
before
the
committee
.
there
shall
be
a
presumption
,
to
be
sustained
when
the
record
is
viewed
as
a
whole
,
in
favor
of
a
committee
recommendation
under
either
(
b
)
or
(
c

(
emphasis
added
)
despite
assertions
to
the
contrary
,
the
last
sentence
of
paragraph
`
d
'
obligates
fda
to
establish
that
the
committee
was
wrong
in
order
not
to
follow
the
committees
recommendation
.
ultimately
,
therefore
,
there
would
,
in
fact
,
be
a
significant
transfer
of
authority
if
the
suggested
provision
were
to
be
adopted
by
fda
.
as
fda
noted
in
the
dietary
supplement
health
claims
proposal
(
58
fr
33700
at
33704
,
there
is
no
basis
under
the
act
for
such
a
transfer
of
authority
.
fda
does
not
question
that
experts
on
an
industry
committee
or
panel
on
herbs
and
botanicals
could
be
helpful
.
the
agency
encourages
firms
to
work
through
such
groups
.
for
this
reason
,
fda
revised
the
provision
pertaining
to
petitions
in
the
health
claims
final
rule
to
clarify
that
the
agency
will
consider
all
recommendations
by
such
committees
and
panels
(
see
§
101
70
.
fda
recognizes
that
those
petitions
that
have
undergone
an
independent
scientific
review
and
received
endorsement
by
qualified
expert
groups
will
likely
be
wellsupported
well
supported
petitions
and
could
be
very
persuasive
to
fda
.
further
,
fda
is
likely
to
place
considerable
weight
on
the
recommendations
of
outside
experts
,
and
its
decision
as
to
whether
a
petition
should
be
granted
could
be
influenced
significantly
by
these
experts
.
although
fda
encourages
firms
to
work
through
groups
of
outside
experts
,
the
agency
would
be
concerned
if
such
groups
were
heavily
weighted
with
medical
practitioners
as
one
of
the
comments
suggested
.
over
reliance
on
such
practitioners
,
to
the
exclusion
of
scientists
representing
other
relevant
scientific
descriptives
,
implies
that
the
herbs
are
to
be
used
for
medicinal
purposes
.
fda
stresses
again
that
health
claims
are
about
the
relationship
of
foods
,
rather
than
drugs
,
to
a
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition

.
establishment
of
an
approach
based
on
a
more
lenient
or
the
same
standard
fda
proposed
to
subject
dietary
supplements
to
the
same
scientific
standard
and
procedure
that
the
statute
provides
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
(
section
403r3bi
)
of
the
act
.
the
standard
,
codified
in
§

,
states

)
validity
requirement
.
fda
will
promulgate
regulations
authorizing
a
health
claim
only
when
it
determines
,
based
on
the
totality
of
publicly
available
scientific
evidence
(
including
evidence
from
welldesigned
well
designed
studies
conducted
in
a
manner
which
is
consistent
with
generally
recognized
scientific
procedures

principles
,
that
there
is
significant
scientific
agreement
,
among
experts
qualified
by
scientific
training
and
experience
to
evaluate
such
claims
,
that
the
claim
is
supported
by
such
evidence
.
fda
explained
in
the
dietary
supplement
health
claims
proposal
(
58
fr
33700
at
33705
)
that
it
knows
of
no
standard
and
procedure
for
dietary
supplements
that
would
both
be
more
lenient
than
the
standard
and
procedure
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
and
yet
still
have
the
characteristics
that
fda
considers
necessary
under
the
1990
amendments
and
their
legislative
history
.
the
agency
stated
that
it
had
tentatively
concluded
that
a
standard
for
health
claims
for
dietary
supplements
that
is
based
only
on
section

of
the

(
21
usc

,
or
that
allows
health
claims
based
on
the
existence
of
substantial
scientific
evidence
,
even
though
significant
scientific
agreement
about
the
validity
of
the
claim
does
not
exist
,
would
be
inconsistent
with
congresss
desire
to
ensure
that
health
claims
that
are
made
on
food
,
including
dietary
supplements
,
are
scientifically
valid
.
fda
said
that
it
was
concerned
that
if
it
were
to
allow
claims
in
the
marketplace
whose
validity
had
not
been
established
,
these
claims
would
undercut
the
credibility
of
those
health
claims
that
are
in
fact
valid
.
the
agency
said
that
if
it
were
to
allow
such
claims
,
consumers
would
be
left
little
better
off
,
and
no
less
confused
,
than
they
were
in
1989
,
before
the
passage
of
the
1990
amendments
.
fda
also
expressed
its
tentative
view
that
the
proposed
approach
strikes
the
appropriate
balance
between
the
congressional
concern
for
consumer
fraud
,
public
health
,
and
sound
science
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
desire
to
provide
the
consumer
with
information

the
other

a
large
number
of
comments
asserted
that
fda
should
establish
an
approach
based
on
a
more
lenient
standard
for
dietary
supplements
.
some
of
these
comments
argued
that
such
an
approach
is
directed
by
congress
and
cited
a
statement
of
senator
hatch
,
one
of
the
primary
authors
of
the
1990
amendments
,
that
`
a
more
lenient
standard
for
dietary
supplements
]
is
envisioned
'
one
comment
argued
that
by
providing
for
the
establishment
of
a
separate
standard
for
dietary
supplements
,
congress
had
implicitly
rejected
the
rigid
standard
of
`
significant
scientific
agreement
'
adopted
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
the
comment
asserted
that
fda
was
therefore
bound
by
basic
tenets
of
statutory
construction
to
adopt
a
more
lenient
standard
for
dietary
supplements
,
as
such
an
action
would
give
meaning
to
congresss
instructions
,
whereas
the
adoption
of
the
proposed
standard
would
in
effect
render
those
instructions
meaningless
.
the
comment
noted
that
courts
have
traditionally
not
interpreted
provisions
of
a
statute
in
ways
that
would
render
other
provisions
superfluous
.
a
number
of
comments
stated
that
using
the
same
standard
and
procedure
for
dietary
supplements
as
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
is
counter
to
the
intent
of
the
1990
amendments
because
congress
intended
to
make
more
,
rather
than
less
,
information
about
the
health
benefits
of
dietary
supplements
available
to
consumers
.
the
comments
asserted
that
health
information
about
the
effects
of
diet
on
disease
is
particularly
important
to
consumers
of
dietary
supplements
in
deciding
which
products
to
buy
.
several
comments
argued
that
restricting
this
information
on
dietary
supplements
will
deny
millions
of
americans
the
information
that
they
need
to
improve
their
health
and
to
help
reduce
their
risk
of
deadly
afflictions
such
as
heart
disease
and
cancer
.
the
comments
asserted
that
such
restriction
will
cost
the
nation
millions
of
dollars
in
health
care
expenditures
that
could
have
been
saved
through
disease
prevention
.
some
comments
expressed
concern
that
restricting
the
use
of
properly
qualified
health
claims
based
on
preliminary
evidence
would
encourage
informationhungry
information
hungry
consumers
to
seek
information
about
the
health
benefits
of
various
dietary
supplements
from
sources
such
as
books
and
the
media
,
which
may
be
unreliable
and
which
are
not
regulated
by
fda
.
these
comments
argued
that
adopting
a
policy
that
results
in
consumers
turning
to
information
that
may
well
be
misleading
or
outright
false
is
contrary
to
the
educational
goals
of
the
1990
amendments
.
one
comment
stressed
that
fda
should
assist
consumers
by
encouraging
them
to
reduce
their
risk
of
disease
by
changing
their
diets
,
lifestyle
,
and
other
factors
.
comments
suggested
that
fda
should
place
more
weight
on
the
potential
benefits
of
the
health
information
than
on
eliminating
all
possibility
for
consumer
misunderstanding
or
all
elements
of
risk
associated
with
increased
consumption
of
dietary
supplements
.
a
few
of
these
comments
advised
that
a
more
lenient
standard
would
be
appropriate
for
dietary
supplements
because
they
are
being
sold
to
educated
consumers
rather
than
to
the
general
population
.
some
of
these
comments
disputed
the
argument
that
consumers
could
be
misled
by
a
more
lenient
standard
.
these
comments
noted
that
consumers
continue
to
rely
on
health
messages
on
products
such
as
cigarettes
and
condoms
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
messages
have
changed
over
the
years
in
response
to
new
scientific
findings
.
other
comments
stated
that
studies
have
indicated
that
consumers
are
able
to
use
various
advertising
claims
about
diet
and
disease
in
a
rational
and
beneficial
manner
.
several
comments
asserted
that
fda
should
allow
the
use
of
preliminary
health
claims
on
dietary
supplements
and
foods
in
conventional
food
form
because
it
allows
their
use
on
drugs
.
the
comments
stated
that

of

labeling
in
the

allow

were
qualified
by
the
statement
,
`

the
comments
stated
that
because
these
drugs
had
not
been
tested
for
safety
and
efficacy
in
children
,
their
claims
would
be
`
preliminary
'
at
best
and
misbranding
at
worst
.
however
,
many
comments
argued
against
a
more
lenient
standard
and
procedure
for
dietary
supplements
.
several
comments
stressed
that
the
adoption
of
the
proposed
standard
and
procedure
is
supported
by
the
legislative
histories
of
the
1990
amendments
and
the
ds
act
.
one
of
these
comments
maintained
that
while
the
1990
amendments
give
fda
the
option
of
adopting
a
more
lenient
standard
for
dietary
supplements
,
the
congressional
record
denotes
a
majority
opinion
in
favor
of
fda
applying
the
same
standard
to
supplements
that
the
act
provides
for
conventional
foods
.
a
number
of
comments
also
warned
fda
that
holding
dietary
supplements
and
foods
in
conventional
food
form
to
different
standards
for
health
claims
would
lead
to
consumer
confusion
,
as
the
health
benefits
of
nutrients
derived
from
dietary
supplements
would
be
allowed
to
be
characterized
as
superior
to
the
benefits
of
those
same
nutrients
derived
from
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
some
comments
asserted
that
the
creation
of
public
confusion
would
directly
undermine
the
intent
of
the
1990
amendments
to
clear
up
consumer
confusion
about
health
claim
information
and
would
jeopardize
consumer
confidence
in
existing
health
claims
,
food
labels
,
and
the
government
,
particularly
public
health
officials
.
another
comment
asserted
that
adopting
a
more
lenient
standard
for
dietary
supplements
could
also
allow
some
supplement
manufacturers
to
make
unsubstantiated
claims
and
undercut
consumer
belief
in
the
credibility
of
the
entire
supplement
industry
.
these
comments
asserted
that
a
single
universal
standard
would
best
prevent
consumer
confusion
by
ensuring
that
health
claim
information
is
uniform
on
all
foods
.
several
comments
supported
the
same
standard
and
procedure
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
ensure
that
health
claims
appearing
on
the
labels
of
dietary
supplements
are
based
on
reliable
,
peerreviewed
peer
reviewed
,
reproducible
evidence
.
a
number
of
these
comments
stated
that
because
supplements
,
unlike
conventional
foods
,
are
taken
specifically
for
the
health
benefits
associated
with
them
,
it
is
especially
important
that
health
claims
on
these
products
be
reliable
because
more
and
more
consumers
are
using
these
products
in
the
belief
that
the
products
will
protect
their
health
.
the
comments
said
that
these
consumers
were
responding
to
the
large
amounts
of
recent
evidence
indicating
that
vitamins
,
minerals
,
and
other
nutrients
may
play
a
role
in
reducing
the
risk
of
chronic
diseases
.
some
comments
cautioned
fda
that
the
failure
to
ensure
that
health
claims
on
dietary
supplements
are
reliable
would
leave
consumers
open
to
fraud
.
a
few
of
these
comments
pointed
out
that
many
consumers
do
not
have
the
scientific
knowledge
to
judge
the
veracity
of
label
claims
for
themselves
and
presume
that
fda
regulations
ensure
that
label
claims
are
properly
substantiated
.
one
of
these
comments
warned
that
older
americans
are
especially
vulnerable
to
fraud
.
this
comment
pointed
out
that
the
elderly
suffer
disproportionally
from
dietrelated
diet
related
diseases
,
read
supplement
labels
more
often
than
other
people
,
are
more
trusting
of
salespersons
,
and
do
less
research
than
younger
consumers
.
other
comments
warned
that
unsubstantiated
health
claims
can
harm
consumers
by
inducing
them
to
consume
products
that
are
inherently
unsafe
,
to
consume
excessive
doses
of
some
substances
,
or
to
forego
more
beneficial
forms
of
treatment
for
a
given
malady
.
a
number
of
comments
insisted
that
the
proposed
regulations
will
not
restrict
the
flow
of
information
on
nutrition
and
health
to
consumers
.
one
of
these
comments
stated
that
roughly
80
percent
of
supplement
labels
are
already
in
compliance
with
the
proposed
regulations
.
other
comments
noted
that
educational
materials
are
not
covered
by
the
proposed
regulations
,
and
that
there
are
many
available
channels
through
which
information
can
be
freely
disseminated
other
than
food
labeling
.
moreover
,
one
comment
contended
that
supplement
labels
are
neither
intended
,
nor
currently
used
,
to
educate
the
public
but
instead
serve
to
sell
the
product
to
which
they
are
attached
.
some
comments
stated
that
applying
the
same
standard
to
both
conventional
foods
and
dietary
supplements
would
create
a
desirable
`
level
playing
field
'
for
all
food
processors
and
manufacturers
.
one
comment
stated
the
adoption
of
the
proposed
standard
will
provide
an
atmosphere
in
which
all
food
manufacturers
can
move
toward
the
production
of
healthier
foods
,
which
will
benefit
the
public
health
.
in
fdas
reconsideration
of
how
best
to
regulate
dietary
supplements
,
one
of
the
most
significant
issues
has
been
the
issue
of
whether
supplements
should
be
regulated
under
a
more
lenient
standard
or
the
same
scientific
standard
as
that
established
by
congress
for
food
in
conventional
food
form
.
despite
assertions
by
some
that
congress
directed
that
a
more
lenient
standard
be
established
,
the
legislative
history
of
the
1990
amendments
does
not
support
such
a
position
.
to
the
contrary
,
as
other
comments
point
out
,
and
as
the
agency
explained
in
the
preambles
of
the
health
claims
proposal
(
56
fr
60537
at
60539
through
60540
,
the
health
claims
final
rule
(

,
and
the
dietary
supplement
health
claims
proposal
(
58
fr
33700
at
33703
,
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
agency
be
forced
to
adopt
a
different
standard
for
dietary
supplements
.
instead
,
congress
gave
the
agency
the
discretion
to
adopt
any
appropriate
scientific
standard
and
procedure
for
dietary
supplements
.
there
was
nothing
in
the
comments
that
indicated
that
fda
does
not
have
this
discretion
.
indeed
,
as
some
of
the
comments
pointed
out
,
there
was
considerable
support
in
both
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
for
adoption
of
the
same
scientific
standard
and
procedure
for
dietary
supplements
.
fda
addressed
the
position
of
members
of
congress
on
this
issue
in
the
preamble
of
the
dietary
supplement
health
claims
proposal
(
58

:

however
,

clear
about
their
position
that

it

my
view
that
there
is
no

anything
other
than
utilize
the

procedure

standard
for
dietary

.
whatever
approach
the

takes
,
he
must
establish
a
system
that
evaluates
the
validity
of

further
,
the
house
of
representatives
clearly
did
not
support
a
more
lenient
standard
for
dietary
supplements
.
the
statement
of

that
appears

its
system
must
be

considerations
of

as
in
every
similar
decision
made
by
the
agency
today
,
we
fully
expect
that
the
agencys
evaluation
of
disease
claims
made
with

to

will
be
based
on
sound
scientific

there
is
a
great
potential
for

if

sold
that
contains
inaccurate
or
unsupportable
health
claims
.
the
potential
is
just
as
great
for
vitamins
as
it
is
for
other
products
.
in
our
view
,
vitamins
and
other
substances
covered
by
this
provision
should
be
subject
to
at
least
as
strong
a
standard
as
is
applicable
to
other

that
contain
claims
that
the
food
will
treat
a
disease
or
health
condition
.
nothing
in
the
ds
act
or
its
legislative
history
indicates
in
any
way
that
congress
changed
its
position
about
its
goals
of
the
1990
amendments
with
respect
to
prohibiting
misleading
health
claims
and
improvement
of

use
of
valid

although
congress
left
no
question
that
the
exact
standard
and
procedure
for
the
regulation
of
health
claims
for
dietary
supplements
is
left
to
the
discretion
of
fda
,
and
although
congress
did
not
provide
direct
guidance
concerning
how
fda
should
use
this
discretion
,
congress
did
provide
considerable
general
guidance
about
the
intent
of
the
health
claims
provisions
of
the
1990
amendments
.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
guidance
does
not
distinguish
between
dietary
supplements
and
foods
in
conventional
food
form
,
fda
considers
this
guidance
to
be
applicable
to
both
types
of

(
emphasis
added
.
by
taking
this
approach
,
congress
chose
to
permit
only
those
health
claims
on
food
that
fda
determines
to
be
scientifically
valid
,
effectively
recognizing
that
health
claims
are
so
potentially
misleading
as
to
be
inherently
misleading
.
applying
the
same
standard
and
procedure
to
health
claims
on
dietary
supplements
as
that
that
applies
to
foods
in
conventional
food
form
will
not
affect
the
availability
of
any
dietary
supplements
,
will
ensure
that
health
claims
that
appear
in
labeling
are
scientifically
valid
and
understandable
,
and
will
subject
all
segments
of
the
food
industry
to
regulation
in
a
fair
and
consistent
manner
.
those
comments
favoring
the
same
standard
and
procedure
,
for
reasons
of
fairness
,
control
of
consumer
fraud
,
and
conveyance
of
valid
information
about
diet
and
its
impact
on
a
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
,
serve
to
reinforce
fdas
conclusion
that
the
agencys
proposed
rule
should
be
finalized
as
proposed
.
the
agency
disagrees
with
arguments
that
use
of
the
same
approach
for
dietary
supplements
as
for
conventional
foods
would
deny
millions
of
americans
the
dietary
information
that
they
need
to
improve
their
health
and
thereby
cost
the
nation
millions
of
dollars
in
health
care
expenditures
that
could
have
been
avoided
.
as
fda
explained
in
the
preamble
of
the
dietary
supplement
health
claims
proposal
(

at

:
*
*
*
*
*
*
in
the
absence
of
adequate
data
to
establish
that
health
claims
are
valid
,
assertions
about
costs
associated
with
the
lack
of
information
in
food
labeling
and
about
the
benefits
of
consumption
of
substances
in
dietary
supplements
are
highly
speculative
and
highly
questionable
.
fda
does
not
agree
that
it
should
place
more
weight
on
the
potential
benefits
of
the
health
information
than
on
eliminating
the
possibility
of
consumer
misunderstanding
.
fda
must
weigh
the
public
health
impact
of
permitting
a
multitude
of
preliminary
claims
against
the
possibility
that
a
significant
portion
of
those
claims
will
be
determined
to
be
not
scientifically
valid
.
the
latter
result
would
likely
produce
a
perception
among
many
consumers
that
food
labels
and
health
claims
,
even
those
that
are
valid
,
are
not
reliable
.
to
the
extent
that
,
as
a
result
,
consumers
do
not
change
their
dietary
patterns
to
reduce
their
risk
of
disease
,
they
will
be
less
healthy
,
and
there
will
be
more
needless
deaths
from
disease
and
more
costs
to
the
national
economy
,
rather
than
less
.
when
fda
made
this
statement
,
the
phrase
`
adequate
data
to
establish
that
health
claims
are
valid
'
was
intended
to
express
the
position
that
until
the
validity
requirements
of
§
101
14
)
are
met
,
cost
assertions
about
the
benefits
of
substance
consumption
are
highly
speculative
and
highly
questionable
.
in
general
,
prior
to
fulfillment
of
this
requirement
,
there
may
often
be
studies
with
a
wide
variety
of
strengths
and
weaknesses
indicating
that
there
may
,
or
may
not
,
be
a
valid
association
between
a
substance
and
a
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
.
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
authorize
a
claim
,
fda
must
consider
that
,
while
benefits
may
accrue
from
the
availability
of
the
claim
,
there
is
a
very
real
possibility
that
significant
costs
may
accrue
if
the
claim
is
authorized
prematurely
.
a
few
studies
may
often
be
found
about
a
multitude
of
associations
,
and
many
,
if
not
most
,
of
those
associations
will
ultimately
be
found
not
to
be
valid
.
if
fda
were
to
permit
preliminary
claims
about
such
a
multitude
of
associations
,
the
agency
believes
that
ultimately
what
would
be
lost
is
the
confidence
of
most
consumers
in
the
validity
of
all
claims
that
appear
in
food
labeling
.
fda
believes
that
the
costs
to
consumers
of
such
a
situation
would
prove
to
be
greater
than
the
costs
of
not
permitting
preliminary
claims
.
of
greater
significance
,
however
,
is
that
needless
deaths
would
ultimately
occur
where
consumers
would
not
change
their
dietary
patterns
to
adopt
a
more
healthful
diet
.
the
agency
believes
that
congress
,
in
its
enactment
of
the
scientific
standard
in
section
403r3bi
)
of
the
act
,
struck
what
it
believed
to
be
an
appropriate
balance
between
the
costs
and
benefits
of
claims
on
foods
in
general
.
fda
is
not
aware
of
any
reason
to
strike
a
different
balance
for
dietary
supplements
.
fda
would
like
to
assure
all
affected
parties
that
the
agency
will
move
as
expeditiously
as
possible
to
permit
health
claims
once
the
scientific
evidence
is
sufficiently
supportive
to
conclude
that
associations
between
substances
and
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
conditions
are
valid
.
although
some
comments
asserted
that
claims
based
on
a
more
lenient
standard
would
not
be
confusing
because
consumers
of
dietary
supplements
are
more
knowledgeable
than
the
general
population
,
fda
pointed
out
in
the
preamble
of
the
dietary
supplement
health
claims
proposal
(
58
fr
33700
at
33705
)
that
there
is
nothing
that
limits
the
purchasers
of
dietary
supplements
to
`
knowledgeable
consumers
'
the
comments
did
not
submit
justification
for
fda
to
change
its
position
in
this
regard
.
assertions
that
use
of
the
same
scientific
standard
for
dietary
supplements
as
that
established
for
food
in
conventional
food
form
is
counter
to
the
1990
amendments
because
less
information
about
diet
and
disease
will
be
available
to
consumers
are
not
correct
.
under
the
1990
amendments
,
authorized
health
claims
provide
considerably
more
information
about
the
effects
of
diet
on
disease
where
the
effects
are
recognized
as
scientifically
valid
than
was
the
case
before
the
passage
of
the
1990
amendments
.
in
the
federal
register
of
01/06/1993
,
fda
authorized
claims
with
respect
to
7
relationships
(
see
58
fr
2537
,
2552
,
2622
,
2665
,

,
and
2820
.
also
,
in
the
federal
register
of
10/14/1993
(
58
fr
53254
,
fda
proposed
to
permit
health
claims
concerning
the
relationship
between
folate
and
the
risk
of
neural
tube
birth
defects
.
admittedly
,
other
health
claims
are
not
permitted
to
appear
on
food
labels
and
labeling
,
but
congress
clearly
intended
through
enactment
of
section
403r
)
of
the
act
that
only
valid
health
claims
be
permitted
.
with
respect
to
concerns
that
consumers
will
be
forced
to
seek
information
about
diet
and
health
from
unregulated
sources
such
as
books
and
the
media
,
if
fda
does
not
authorize
preliminary
claims
,
fda
advises
that
it
must
implement
the
provisions
of
the
amendments
as
congress
chose
to
enact
them
.
the
1990
amendments
focus
only
on
food
labels
and
labeling
.
fda
cannot
ignore
its
clear
responsibilities
under
the
1990
amendments
because
of
concerns
about
the
unregulated
sources
of
information
that
were
mentioned
in
the
comments
.
moreover
,
while
such
sources
of
information
may
lead
consumers
to
seek
out
products
containing
particular
substances
,
fdas
action
will
ensure
that
the
labels
and
labeling
of
those
products
contain
only
scientifically
valid
information
that
can
dispel
any
misconceptions
created
by
the
unregulated
sources
.
with
respect
to
other
concerns
expressed
by
these
comments
,
the
agency
believes
that
the
specific
required
elements
in
the
health
claims
that
it
has
authorized
to
date
demonstrate
that
the
agency
is
encouraging
consumers
to
reduce
their
risk
of
disease
by
changing
their
diets
and
lifestyle
.
for
example
,
the
specific
requirements
in
§
101
72
)
requires
,
in
part
,
that
a
claim
about
calcium
and
osteoporosis
make
clear
that
an
adequate
level
of
exercise
and
a
healthful
diet
are
needed
in
addition
to
adequate
calcium
consumption
.
arguments
that
the
agency
should
allow
preliminary
claims
because
of
fdas
implementation
of
the
drug
provisions
of
the
act
have
no
merit
.
assertions
about
fdas
proposed
action
pertaining
to
`
pediatric
use
'
for
drug
labeling
in
(
57
fr
47423
)
are
clearly
wrong
.
the
agencys
proposed
action
with
respect
to
requiring
the
statement
`
safety
and
effectiveness
in
children
have
not
been
established
'
pertains
only
to
drugs
for
which
there
is
no
agency
approval
for
any
pediatric
population
to
use
the
drug
.
in
point
of
fact
,
the
agency
proposed
to
require
this
statement
as
a
further
warning
that
the
product
should
not
be
used
for
pediatric
populations
.
thus
,
this
action
provides
no
support
for
authorizing
preliminary
health
claims
.
as
fda
pointed
out
in
the
preamble
of
the
dietary
supplement
health
claims
proposal
(
58
fr
33700
at
33706
,
making
dietary
supplements
subject
to
the
same
scientific
standard
and
procedure
as
for
conventional
foods
does
not
render
section
403r5d
)
of
the
act
superfluous
.
this
section
requires
that
the
agency
consider
what
procedure
and
standard
respecting
the
validity
of
claims
are
most
appropriate
.
this
is
what
the
agency
has
done
.
the
fact
that
the
agency
has
found
that
,
on
balance
,
the
standard
and
procedure
established
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
are
also
the
most
appropriate
for
dietary
supplements
does
not
render
the
agencys
efforts
invalid
or
the
underlying
provision
superfluous
.
the
agency
was
charged
with
exercising
its
expertise
and
discretion
,
and
that
is
what
it
has
done
.

.
a
number
of
comments
provided
specific
suggestions
about
the
way
in
which
a
more
lenient
approach
could
be
implemented
.
some
comments
argued
that
the
approach
should
be
sufficiently
lenient
to
permit
marketing
of
dietary
supplements
without
any
restrictions
.
some
of
these
comments
argued
that
dietary
supplements
needed
no
stringent
requirements
because
dietary
supplements
could
be
adequately
regulated
under
the
requirement
in
section
403a1
)
of
the
act
that
the
labeling
of
a
food
must
be
truthful
and
not
misleading
.
other
comments
suggested
that
fda
could
require
a
warning
informing
the
consumer
that
fda
had
not
substantiated
particular
claims
appearing
on
a
product
.
one
comment
suggested
that
substantiated
claims
could
be
allowed
to
appear
within
a
specific
advisory
panel
of
the
label
,
while
preliminary
claims
would
be
allowed
to
appear
only
outside
the
panel
.
another
comment
suggested
that
fda
adopt
a
split
label
approach
,
in
which
preliminary
health
claims
would
be
allowed
,
but
the
agency
would
have
the
right
to
comment
upon
them
on
the
label
.
one
comment
suggested
that
health
claims
for
which
there
is
substantial
scientific
evidence
but
not
yet
significant
scientific
agreement
be
subject
to
a
certification
and
notification
procedure
rather
than
rulemaking
proceedings
.
under
the
procedure
suggested
by
the
comment
,
claims
could
be
made
for
dietary
supplements
so
long
as
:
(
1
)
the
claim
expressly
discloses
the
absence
of
scientific
agreement
as
to
the
relationship
,
(
2
)
the
manufacturer
provides
fda
with
a
fully
documented
certification
by
a
panel
of
at
least
three
qualified
experts
that
there
is
substantial
scientific
evidence
supporting
the
claim
,
and
(
3
)
fda
does
not
disapprove
the
claim
within
90
days
of
receipt
of
the
certification
.
(
when
additional
information
is
needed
,
the
90
day
period
could
be
extended
an
additional
45
days
)
under
this
suggested
alternative
,
fda
would
have
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
selection
of
the
expert
panel
.
one
comment
requested
that
fda
only
disallow
the
use
of
those
health
claims
on
dietary
supplements
that
are
not
supported
by
any
evidence
,
and
that
it
classify
all
other
health
claims
into
one
of
five
categories
and
allow
for
their
use
on
products
in
conjunction
with
a
code
system
indicating
to
consumers
the
level
of
substantiation
that
the
claim
has
achieved
.
the
comment
suggested
that
the
highest
category
be
full
substantiation
;
the
second
,
those
claims
that
have
a
high
degree
of
substantiation
as
judged
by
nonfda
fda
experts
,
but
that
fda
finds
to
be
not
fully
substantiated
;
the
third
,
claims
that
have
support
in
the
form
of
doubleblind
double
blind
placebo
controlled
studies
published
in
peerreviewed
peer
reviewed
professional
journals
;
the
fourth
,
claims
that
are
supported
by
some
evidence
from
in
vitro
studies
,
animal
studies
,
or
other
studies
that
do
not
involve
humans
;
and
the
fifth
,
those
claims
supported
by
anecdotal
evidence
.
in
support
of
its
call
for
various
approval
levels
,
the
comment
stated
that
simply
categorizing
a
claim
as
`
substantiated
'
or
`
unsubstantiated
'
does
not
accommodate
the
reality
that
full
substantiation
of
a
health
claim
consists
of
cumulative
evidence
from
many
studies
.
the
comment
maintained
that
if
fda
were
to
place
all
claims
that
have
not
achieved
full
substantiation
into
the
same
category
,
fda
would
not
be
providing
a
means
for
the
public
to
distinguish
claims
that
are
nearly
substantiated
from
those
that
are
entirely
false
.
moreover
,
the
comment
stated
that
an
agency
determination
that
a
claim
is
or
is
not
supported
by
`
significant
scientific
agreement
'
often
reflects
a
political
decision
rather
than
a
scientific
one
.
the
comments
said
that
fda
panels
comprise
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
scientific
community
,
that
other
scientists
often
disagree
with
the
panels
'
findings
,
and
that
there
even
may
be
differing
opinions
within
the
panels
themselves
.
the
comment
stated
that
,
given
these
conditions
,
it
is
blatantly
dishonest
and
misleading
to
the
public
for
fda
to
make
a
general
declaration
that
a
claim
is
or
is
not
substantiated
.
a
few
similar
comments
called
for
fda
to
devise
a
multilevel
approval
scheme
for
health
claims
on
dietary
supplements
that
would
allow
statements
concerning
the
traditional
use
of
a
product
to
appear
on
the
label
and
would
permit
the
label
of
a
supplement
that
contained
a
substance
that
was
the
subject
of
a
pending
health
claim
petition
to
indicate
that
the
product
was
under
fda
review
for
a
health
claim
but
not
to
indicate
the
nature
of
the
claim
.
the
comments
stated
that
the
adoption
of
this
approach
would
encourage
manufacturers
of
products
that
qualify
only
for
the
`
traditional
uses
'
or
`
claim
pending
'
approval
categories
to
gather
,
perform
,
and
submit
research
information
to
fda
in
order
to
reach
higher
approval
levels
.
one
comment
suggested
that
fda
allow
manufacturers
to
use
facsimiles
of
the
fda
seal
in
conjunction
with
the
various
ratings
.
the
comment
asserted
that
this
approach
would
encourage
manufacturers
to
come
into
compliance
with
fda
regulations
quickly
,
as
the
seals
would
become
valuable
marketing
tools
for
which
consumers
look
when
purchasing
supplements
,
and
the
lack
of
a
seal
would
become
a
marketing
disadvantage
for
a
company
.
fda
has
considered
these
alternative
standards
and
procedures
suggested
by
the
comments
and
finds
that
none
of
them
have
the
characteristics
that
are
necessary
to
achieve
the
goal
envisioned
by
congress
in
passing
the
1990
amendments
.
previously
in
this
preamble
the

one
of
congress
'
primary
concerns
in

was
the
widespread
use
of
health

the

the
problem
with
the
alternative
procedures
offered
by
the
comments
is
that
,
rather
than
bringing
the
use
of
claims
on
dietary
supplements
under
control
,
they
would
ratify
the
state
of
affairs
that
caused
congress
to
act
.
as
fda
explained
in
the
preamble
of
the
dietary
supplement
health
claims
proposal
,
a
standard
for
health
claims
for
dietary
supplements
that
is
based
only
on
section
403a1
)
of
the
act
,
or
that
allows
health
claims
based
on
the
traditional
use
of
the
supplement
or
the
existence
of
substantial
scientific
evidence
but
not
significant
scientific
agreement
about
the
validity
of
the
claim
,
would
be
inconsistent
with
congresss
desire
to
ensure
that
health
claims
that
are
made
on
dietary
supplements
,
or
on
any
other
food
,
are
scientifically
valid
.
fda
pointed
out
that
if
such
claims
were
to
be
permitted
,
consumers
would
be
faced
with
a
multitude
of
claims
,
some
valid
and
some
not
valid
.
fda
stated
that
it
would
be
unlikely
that
consumers
could
distinguish
between
valid
and
invalid
claims
.
although
comments
on
the
dietary
supplement
health
claims
proposal
asserted
that
consumers
would
not
be
confused
by
a
multitude
of
claims
,
the
comments
did
not
actually
go
further
in
addressing
how
consumers
would
react
to
such
a
situation
in
food
labeling
.
more
specifically
,
the
comments
did
not
provide
data
to
resolve
the
question
of
whether
consumers
would
be
able
to
understand
gradations
of
scientific
reliability
of
claims
on
food
labeling
,
or
whether
consumers
would
,
in
fact
,
be
left
as
confused
as
they
were
before
passage
of
the
1990
amendments
.
while
a
number
of
comments
did
assert
that
some
studies
show
that
consumers
are
able
to
use
various
advertising
claims
about
diet
and
disease
in
a
rational
and
beneficial
manner
,
the
studies
were
not
actually
submitted
.
in
the
absence
of
the
studies
,
fda
has
no
basis
upon
which
it
can
evaluate
the
assertions
of
the
relevance
of
the
studies
to
food
labeling
.
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
the
contrary
,
the
agency
considers
it
more
likely
that
consumers
would
be
considerably
confused
by
a
multitude
of
claims
with
differing
degrees
of
reliability
.
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
1990
amendments
was
to
end
such
confusion
(

of
mr

therefore
,
fda
rejects
this
assertion
.
approaches
such
as
those
involving
a
`
split
label
'
or
the
use
of
an
fda
seal
would
also
not
be
consistent
with
the
congressional
desire
for
scientific
validity
because
manufacturers
would
still
be
able
to
market
dietary
supplements
with
claims
that
were
not
scientifically
valid
.
even
if
fda
seals
were
being
used
to
distinguish
those
claims
that
fda
considered
to
be
valid
,
there
would
be
a
question
as
to
whether
consumers
would
be
able
to
ascertain
which
claims
were
preliminary
and
which
were
not
.
these
approaches
would
not
restrict
the
number
of
health
claims
that
were
of
questionable
validity
,
about
which
congress
was
specifically
concerned
(
ref
.
1
.
thus
,
fda
has
concluded
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
adopt
any
of
the
alternative
approaches
suggested
by
the
comments
.

several
comments
suggested
that
fda
adopt
the
reasonable
substantiation
standard
used
by
the
federal
trade
commission
(
ftc
)
(
see
ftc
policy
statement
regarding
advertising
substantiation
program
(
49
fr
30999
,
08/02/1984
.
the
comments
asserted
that
under
this
policy
,
fda
could
allow
manufacturers
to
make
claims
provided
that
the
nature
of
the
scientific
finding
is
accurately
represented
,
the
degree
of
evidence
is
not
misrepresented
,
and
the
claim
passes
a
rough
cost
benefit
test
.
the
comments
argued
that
this
policy
would
facilitate
harmonization
with
the
ftc
regulations
governing
the
use
of
health
claims
in
food
advertising
,
would
allow
consumers
to
have
access
to
truthful
,
nonmisleading
,
and
reliable
labeling
information
,
and
would
still
allow
fda
to
take
action
against
those
dietary
supplements
bearing
health
claims
that
are
not
properly
substantiated
.
arguments
that
fda
should
adopt
for
dietary
supplements
ftcs
approach
for
regulating
advertising
are
not
consistent
with
congress
'
expectations
for
health
claims
.
while
the
ftc
and
fda
are
working
together
to
achieve
as
much
consistency
in
their
approaches
to
health
claims
as
their
respective
statutes
allow
,
adoption
by
fda
of
the
ftc
advertising
substantiation
approach
would
not
provide
fda
the
confidence
congress
intended
concerning
the
scientific
validity
of
the
claims
.
specifically
,
as
explained
above
,
one
of
congress
'
main
purposes
in
passing
the
1990
amendments
was
to
ensure
that
health
claims
made
in
food
labeling
are
scientifically
valid
.
no
such
assurance
of
scientific
validity
is
provided
under
the
standard
that
ftc
must
employ
.
under
that
standard
,
there
must
be
some
evidence
to
support
a
claim
,
but
it
need
not
rise
to
the
level
of
establishing
the
claims
validity
.
thus
,
the
ftc
standard
is
not
adequate
for
health
claims
.
in
this
context
,
it
is
appropriate
to
reiterate
fdas
response
to
comments
asserting
that
it
was
bound
to
follow
cases
involving
ftcs
regulation
of
advertising
in
the
preamble
of
the

final
rule
(
58

:
although
cases
involving

may
sometimes
be
relevant
,
it
is
important
to
note
that
fundamental
differences
exist
between
the
regulatory
schemes
administered
by
the
two
agencies
.
congress
has
long
recognized
the
division
of
roles
between
the
two
agenciesftc
concentrates
on
the
interests
of
commerce
and
economic
needs
,
whereas
the
objective
of
fda
is
`
the
health
of
the
people
'
ftc

unfair
competition
and
trade
practices
,
including
food
advertising
.

sections
45
and

in
contrast
,
fda
is
a
scientific
agency
empowered
to
regulate
the
food
label
,
among
other
things
.
under
section
403r3bi
)
of
the
act
,
fda
may
permit
health
claims
on
foods
only
if
it
has
determined
that
those
claims
meet
the
statutory
test
for
scientific
validity
.
the
laws
under
which
ftc
operates
do
not
include
a
comparable
statutory
standard
.
thus
,
it
would
not
be
appropriate
for
fda
to
follow
the
case
law
involving
ftc
.
iii
.
the
final
regulation
in
light
of
the
foregoing
,
fda
is
subjecting
dietary
supplements
to
the
same
standard
and
procedure
that
applies
to
food
in
conventional
food
form
.
the
agency
believes
that
this
approach
strikes
the
appropriate
balance
between
the
congressional
concern
for
consumer
fraud
,
public
health
,
and
sound
science
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
desire
to
provide

on
the
other

the

is
revising

in

,
the

of

basic
elements
of

the

had
not
proposed
a

it

the
agency
added
this
definition
to
clarify
the
coverage
of
the
health

provisions
(
see
§
101
14
.
because
of
the
ds
act
,
the
agency
reserved
the
question
as
to
whether
these
definitions
would
apply
to
dietary
supplements
.
the
agency
also
did
not
include
a
definition
of
`

'
in
the
final
rule
because
of
the
moratorium
imposed
by
the

in
the
dietary

fda
proposed
to
adopt
the

regulatory

for

claims
for
dietary
supplements
that
it
had
established
for
foods
in
conventional

form
.
to
effect
this
tentative
decision
,
the
agency
proposed
to
revise
the
definition
of
`
substance
'
to
make
clear
that
it
covers
both
food
in
conventional

form
and
dietary
supplements
and
to
establish
a
definition
for
`

'
fda
received
no
comments

the
former
aspect
of
the
proposal

therefore
,
the
agency
is
adopting

some
comments

its
proposed

fda
proposed
the
following
definition
for
the
term
`

'
(
proposed

by
increasing
the
total

in
the
past
,
fda
has
taken
a
position
that
the
term

applied
only
to
supplements
composed
of
essential
nutrients
.
however
,
fda
did
not
propose
to

the
definition

in
this
way

of

includes
dietary
supplements
of
herbs

substances
that
generally
contain
few
essential

in
addition
,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that

comment
commended
the

for
proposing

recognized
that

foods
could
have

the
comment
asserted

fda
advises
that
the
comments
assertion
that

dietary
supplements
out
of

not
correct

some
comments
urged
the
agency
to
broaden
its
definition
of
`
nutritive
value
'
these
comments
urged
the
agency
to
recognize
that
the
processes
by
which
a
nutrient
promotes
health
,
maintains
proper
bodily
functioning
,
and
protects
the
body
from
the
development
of
chronic
disease
or
other
healthrelated
health
related
conditions
are
,
in
and
of
themselves
,
characteristic
of
`
nutritive
value
'
the
comments
noted
that
the
basic
function
of
vitamin
e
,
for
example
,
relates
to
its
antioxidant
properties
in
preventing
cell
damage
by
trapping
peroxyl
free
radicals
and
inhibiting
the
oxidation
of
unsaturated
fatty
acids
.
also
,
the
comments
pointed
out
that
fiber
does
not
promote
growth
,
replace
essential
nutrients
,
or
provide
energy
,
but
that
congress
specifically
required
fda
to
study
the
relationship
between
various
diseases
and
fiber
.
some
of
the
comments
asked
that
the
phrase
`
preventing
or
repairing
the
negative
metabolic
consequences
of
life
processes
'
be
added
to
the
list
of
processes
that
characterize
the
nutritive
value
of
a
food
to
ensure
that
such
components
can
be
the
subject
of
health
claims
.
a
few
comments
asserted
that
fda
should
revise
the
definition
of
`
nutritive
value
'
to
provide
for
claims
about
`
prevention
'
of
a
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
.
however
,
one
comment
maintained
that
the
definition
of
`
nutritive
value
'
in
§
101
14
)
is
broad
enough
to
include
the
functions
of
most
dietary
supplements
.
the
comment
supported
its
position
by
agreeing
with
fdas
statement
in
the
health
claims
final
rule
(
58
fr
2478
at
2488
)
that
the
inclusion
of
the
phrase
`
such
as
'
in
the
definition
ensures
that
the
three
referenced
processes
are
examples
of
how
a
substance
may
confer
nutritive
value
rather
than
as
an
allinclusive
all
inclusive
list
.
the
comment
that
highlighted
fdas
use
of
the
phrase
`
such
processes
as
'
in
this
definition
is
correct
.
fda
intended
the
three
referenced
processes
to
be
examples
of
how
a
substance
may
confer
nutritive
value
rather
than
as
an
allinclusive
all
inclusive
list
of
the
functions
that
provide
such
value
.
as
fda
explained
in
the
health
claims
final
rule
(
58
fr
2478
at
2488
,
the
definition
of
`
nutritive
value
'
is
intended
to
be
very
flexible
.
the
agency
incorporated
this
flexibility
in
the
definition
because
fda
recognizes
that
certain
substances
can
play
a
major
role
in
reducing
the
risk
of
certain
chronic
diseases
and
may
confer
their
benefits
through
a
number
of
processes
.
fda
believes
that
the
agency
should
evaluate
the
nutritive
value
claimed
for
a
substance
that
is
proposed
as
the
subject
of
a
health
claim
,
as
described
in
a
health
claim
petition
,
on
a
casebycase
case
by
case
basis
.
this
approach
will
best
ensure
that
the
definition
retains
its
intended
flexibility
and
does
not
become
an
unintentional
barrier
to
authorization
for
legitimate
health
claims
.
fda
does
believe
,
however
,
that
this
preamble
should
provide
guidance
concerning
how
the
agency
will
determine
if
a
claimed
nutrientdisease
nutrient
disease
relationship
derives
from
the
nutritive
value
of
a
substance
.
in
general
,
the
agency
will
look
for
evidence
that
the
claimed
effect
on
disease
is
associated
with
the
normal
maintenance
of
human
existence
.
if
the
substance
is
used
to
correct
an
abnormal
physiological
function
caused
by
a
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
,
the
action
of
the
substance
is
clearly
beyond
a
normal
maintenance
function
,
and
the
health
benefit
would
therefore
not
derive
from
the
substances
nutritive
value
.
such
a
substance
would
be
a
drug
.
(
note
also
that
claims
about
classical
nutrient
deficiency
diseases
are
not
health
claims
(
see
58
fr

)
fda
recognizes
that
many
of
the
benefits
mentioned
in
the
comments
may
derive
from
the
nutritional
value
of
a
substance
.
the
agencys
broad
definition
of
`
nutritive
value
'
includes
assisting
in
the
efficient
functioning
of
classical
nutritional
processes
and
of
other
metabolic
processes
necessary
for
the
normal
maintenance
of
human
existence
.
dietary
fiber
,
for
example
,
helps
to
assure
normal
intestinal
transit
time
,
thereby
providing
nutritional
value
by
promoting
efficient
bowel
function
.
vitamin
e
provides
nutritive
value
through
its
antioxidant
function
of
reduction
of
cell
damage
.
with
respect
to
assertions
that
fda
should
revise
the
definition
of
`
nutritive
value
'
to
provide
for
claims
about
`
prevention
'
of
a
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
,
the
agency
points
out
that
the
preamble
of
the
health
claims
final
rule
(
58
fr
2478
at
2501
through
2502
)
fully
addressed
this
matter
and
concluded
that
a
claim
that
a
substance
can
be
used
in
the
prevention
,
diagnosis
,
cure
,
mitigation
,
or
treatment
of
a
disease
or
symptom
is
inappropriate
for
a
food
(
see
section
201g1b
)
of
the
act
and
§
1019k1
)
(

.
fda
reached
this
conclusion
because
the
relationship
of
a
food
or
a
food
component
to
a
disease
is
quite
different
from
that
of
a
drug
.
the
comments
making
these
assertions
did
not
provide
any
basis
upon
which
fda
could
conclude
that
the
agencys
position
in
this
matter
should
be
different
for
dietary
supplements
than
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
as
fda
explained
in
the
preamble
of
the
health
claims
final
rule
,
the
surgeon
generals
report
on
nutrition
and
health
(
ref
.
5
)
points
out
that
,
apart
from
classic
disorders
resulting
from
dietary
deficiencies
of
essential
nutrients
(
eg
,
pellagra
and
niacin
,
it
has
proved
difficult
to
demonstrate
causal
associations
between
specific
dietary
factors
and
chronic
or
other
diseases
(
eg
,
dietary
fiber
and
cancer
.
the
report
states
:
development
of
the
major
chronic
disease
conditionscoronary
heart
disease
,
stroke
,
diabetes
,
or
canceris
affected
by
multiple
genetic
,
environmental
,
and
behavioral
factors
among
which
diet
is
only
onealbeit
an
importantcomponent
.
these
other
factors
interact
with
diet
in
ways
that
are
not
completely
understood
.
in
addition
,
foods
themselves
are
complex
;
they
may
contain
some
factors
that
promote
disease
as
well
as
others
that
are
protective
.
the
relationship
of
dietary
fat
intake
to
causation
of
atherosclerotic
heart
disease
is
a
prominent
example
.
an
excess
intake
of
total
fat
,
if
characterized
by
high
saturated
fat
,
is
associated
with
high
blood
cholesterol
levels
and
therefore
an
increased
risk
for
coronary
heart
disease
in
many
populations
.
a
higher
proportion
of
mono
-
and
polyunsaturated
fats
in
relation
to
saturated
fats
is
associated
with
lower
blood
cholesterol
levels
and
,
therefore
,
with
a
reduced
risk
for
coronary
heart
disease
.
because
of
these
complexities
,
definitive
scientific
proof
that
specific
dietary
factors
are
responsible
for
specific
chronic
disease
conditions
is
difficultand
may
not
be
possibleto
obtain
,
given
available
technology

several
comments
argued
that
the
definition
of
`
nutritive
value
'
should
include
levels
of
nutrients
that
are
achievable
only
through
the
use
of
fortified
foods
or
dietary
supplements
.
several
of
these
comments
referenced
studies
recently
reported
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
that
indicate
that
vitamin
e
reduces
the
risk
of
heart
disease
when
consumed
at
levels
that
are
almost
impossible
to
achieve
through
a
conventional
diet
but
that
can
be
easily
and
safely
attained
through
the
use
of
dietary
supplements
.
these
comments
asserted
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
fda
to
categorize
the
involved
nutrient
levels
of
vitamin
e
as
therapeutic
and
to
refuse
to
consider
approving
a
health
claim
simply
because
the
claim
concerns
levels
of
a
nutrient
above
that
achievable
in
a
normal
daily
diet
.
a
few
of
the
comments
supported
this
assertion
by
noting
that
the
mechanism
by
which
vitamin
e
protects
against
cell
damage
when
consumed
at
normal
dietary
levels
is
identical
to
the
mechanism
by
which
it
protects
against
heart
disease
when
consumed
at
higher
levels
.
the
comments
maintained
that
,
in
cases
such
as
this
one
,
the
agency
should
approve
health
claims
for
use
strictly
on
dietary
supplements
,
provided
that
the
nutrient
is
safe
when
consumed
at
the
level
at
which
the
claimed
effect
is
achieved
,
and
the
supplement
is
intended
to
be
consumed
to
optimize
health
rather
than
as
a
drug
.
the
comments
supported
this
regulatory
approach
by
noting
that
the
health
benefits
of
calcium
occur
when
the
nutrient
is
consumed
at
increased
levels
that
can
be
achieved
through
the
diet
or
by
supplementation
and
stating
that
vitamin
e
should
not
be
treated
differently
simply
because
the
beneficial
levels
cannot
be
reached
without
the
use
of
dietary
supplements
.
similar
comments
argued
that
fda
should
at
least
avoid
establishing
a
maximum
level
of
a
nutrient
that
is
considered
to
be
characteristic
of
`
nutritive
value
'
one
of
these
comments
noted
such
an
approach
results
in
an
extremely
fuzzy
line
,
because
the
maximum
level
of
a
nutrient
that
is
achievable
in
a
diet
varies
widely
from
one
individual
to
another
.
as
an
example
,
the
comment
pointed
out
that
a
person
who
eats
ten
oranges
or
drinks
a
quart
of
orange
juice
per
day
gets
more
vitamin
c
than
is
provided
by
most
currently
marketed
vitamin
c
supplements
.
a
few
comments
asserted
that
there
is
much
scientific
disagreement
over
what
levels
of
a
nutrient
are
`
nutritive
'
with
many
scientists
contending
that
levels
much
higher
than
the
us
.
recommended
daily
allowances
(
us
.
rda
)
fall
within
the
definition
.
a
few
comments
requested
that
fda
explicitly
express
in
its
regulations
a
policy
that
nutritive
value
may
involve
relatively
high
levels
of
a
nutrient
.
a
few
comments
maintained
that
fda
should
presume
that
all
nutrients
function
in
a
nutritive
manner
regardless
of
their
level
,
unless
it
has
proof
to
the
contrary
.
in
support
of
this
position
,
a
number
of
comments
objected
to
the
use
of
niacins
effect
on
blood
cholesterol
levels
in
the
dietary
supplement
proposal
as
an
example
of
an
effect
that
is
not
nutritive
.
one
of
these
comments
questioned
fdas
assertion
that
niacin
does
not
exhibit
cholesterolreducing
cholesterol
reducing
properties
when
ingested
at
the
levels
conventionally
associated
with
its
function
as
a
vitamin
.
the
comment
stated
that
niacins
vitamin
effect
occurs
below
the
level
of
tissue
saturation
and
maintained
that
the
excretion
of
niacin
when
consumed
at
higher
levels
known
to
be
associated
with
cholesterollowering
cholesterol
lowering
effects
does
not
necessarily
indicate
that
tissue
saturation
has
occurred
.
this
comment
also
disagreed
with
the
agencys
statement
that
the
occurrence
of
liver
damage
when
high
levels
of
niacin
are
consumed
indicates
that
the
effect
of
niacin
at
these
levels
is
not
nutritive
in
nature
.
the
comment
argued
that
it
is
quite
possible
that
niacin
continues
to
have
nutritive
effects
at
these
levels
but
simply
is
overloading
the
bodys
normal
metabolic
pathways
for
ridding
itself
of
excessive
levels
of
the
nutrient
.
the
comment
asserted
that
while
legitimate
safety
concerns
exist
in
particular
cases
of
excessive
nutrient
intake
,
fda
should
not
use
this
fact
to
conclude
that
high
levels
of
those
nutrients
are
inherently
nonnutritive
in
nature
and
are
instead
pharmacological
.
other
comments
expressed
the
belief
that
nothing
in
the
proposed
regulations
would
automatically
exclude
high
levels
of
nutrients
from
the
definition
of
`
nutritive
value
'
and
urged
the
agency
to
include
such
levels
in
instances
where
they
would
benefit
the
public
health
.
these
comments
also
agreed
with
fdas
decision
to
review
on
a
casebycase
case
by
case
basis
whether
the
amount
of
a
substance
is
appropriate
as
the
subject
of
a
health
claim
.
one
of
these
comments
stated
that
such
an
approach
would
help
to
ensure
that
health
information
about
fortified
foods
and
dietary
supplements
can
be
conveyed
without
triggering
the
drug
regulations
.
fda
does
not
believe
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
rules
to
explicitly
state
that
nutritive
value
includes
relatively
high
levels
of
a
nutrient
.
as
some
comments
pointed
out
,
the
casebycase
case
by
case
approach
,
which
,
as
stated
above
,
is
intrinsically
linked
with
the
preliminary
requirement
in
the
provisions
of
§
101
14
,
provides
the
agency
with
considerable
flexibility
with
respect
to
high
levels
of
substances
in
dietary
supplements
.
under
this
approach
,
fda
has
not
,
as
a
general
rule
,
established
any
maximum
level
at
which
a
nutrient
would
cease
to
have
`
nutritive
value
'
furthermore
,
the
agency
advises
that
there
is
no
basis
for
concerns
that
fda
would
use
safety
concerns
alone
to
conclude
that
high
levels
of
nutrients
are
pharmacological
.
fda
will
not
do
so
.
as
some
of
the
comments
pointed
out
,
petitions
for
claims
that
require
that
high
levels
of
substances
be
ingested
should
have
no
problem
demonstrating
that
the
substance
has
nutritive
value
where
the
mechanism
by
which
the
substance
affects
the
risk
of
disease
at
these
high
levels
is
the
same
as
the
mechanism
by
which
it
functions
as
a
nutrient
at
normal
dietary
levels
.
however
,
it
will
still
be
necessary
,
as
the
agency
explained
in
response
to
the
previous
comment
,
for
the
petition
to
show
that
the
substances
effect
on
disease
is
associated
with
the
normal
functioning
of
the
human
body
(
eg
,
the
substance
could
not
be
used
to
correct
an
abnormal
physiological
function
caused
by
a
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
)
in
its
response
to
the
previous
comment
,
the
agency
acknowledged
that
vitamin
e
provides
nutritive
value
through
its
antioxidant
function
of
reduction
of
cell
damage
.
if
there
are
situations
where
it
can
be
established
that
this
same
antioxidant
mechanism
affects
the
risk
of
disease
when
the
vitamin
is
consumed
at
levels
significantly
higher
than
normal
dietary
levels
,
such
levels
would
satisfy
the
requirement
in
§
101
14
)
that
a
substance
retain
its
food
attribute
(
ie
,
its
nutritive
value
)
when
consumed
at
levels
that
are
necessary
to
justify
a
claim
.
fda
does
not
agree
,
however
,
that
it
should
presume
that
all
nutrients
function
in
a
nutritive
manner
,
regardless
of
their
level
,
unless
it
has
proof
to
the
contrary
.
it
would
not
be
practicable
for
the
agency
to
bear
the
burden
of
determining
the
mechanism
by
which
the
claimed
effect
is
occurring
for
each
petitioned
claim
.
thus
,
the
agency
finds
that
it
is
appropriate
to
require
that
petitioners
provide
the
basis
for
why
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
claimed
effect
is
nutritional
and
not
pharmacological
.
however
,
the
agency
does
not
necessarily
expect
absolute
proof
on
this
issue
.
fda
will
evaluate
petitions
on
this
issue
on
a
casebycase
case
by
case
basis
.
the
agency
has
considered
assertions
that
the
dietary
supplement
proposal
should
not
have
cited
the
cholesterolreducing
cholesterol
reducing
properties
of
niacin
as
an
example
of
a
high
dose
effect
that
is
not
nutritive
.
fda
has
again
concluded
that
niacin
is
an
appropriate
example
because
there
are
significant
indications
that
a
nutritive
mechanism
is
not
responsible
for
the
cholesterollowering
cholesterol
lowering
effect
that
occurs
with
high
levels
of
niacin
intake
.
when
fda
stated
in
the
dietary
supplement
proposal
that
levels
of
niacin
necessary
to

nonetheless
,
fda
received
several
comments
on
this

12
.
some
comments
asserted
that
fda
should
clarify
the
types
of
statements
that
will
be
regulated
as
health
claims
.
a
few
of
these
comments
asked
whether
statements
that
indicate
that
a
product
may
be
useful
in
maintaining
good
health
(
eg
,
`

may
be

`

)
will
be
considered
to
be
health

.
the
comments
objected
to
fdas
failure
to
provide
clear
instruction
in
this
regard
.
these
comments
asserted
that
the
agencys
allowance
of
casebycase
case
by
case
interpretation
of
the
regulations
will
hinder
industry
compliance
,
create
enforcement
problems
for
the
agency
,
and
cause
continued
antagonism
between
fda
and
the
food
industry
.
fda
believes
that
it
provided
ample
guidance
on
what
types
of
statements
constitute
health
claims
in
the
health
claims
final
rule
.
as
the
agency
explained
in
the
preamble
of
that
rule
(
58
fr
2478
at
2479
through
2488
,
the
definition
establishes
that
a
claim
must
have
at
least
two
basic
elements
for
it
to
be
regulated
as
a
`
health
claim
'
first
,
the
claim
must
be
about
a
`
substance
'
as
defined
in
§
101
14
.
secondly
,
the
claim
must
characterize
the
relationship
of
that
substance
to
a
`
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
'
as
defined
in
§
101
14
:
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
means
damage
to
an
organ
,
part
,
structure
,
or
system
of
the
body
such
that
it
does
not
function
properly
(
eg
,
cardiovascular
disease
,
or
a
state
of
health
leading
to
such
dysfunctioning
(
eg
,
hypertension
;
except
that
diseases
resulting
from
essential
nutrient
deficiencies
(
eg
,
scurvy
,
pellagra
)
are
not
included
in
this
definition
(
claims
pertaining
to
such
diseases
are
thereby
not
subject
to
101
14
or
101
70
.
if
a
statement
has
one
of
these
elements
without
the
other
,
it
would
not
be
a
`
health
claim
'
although
it
may
still
be
subject
to
regulation
under
other
provisions
of
the
act
(
eg
,
the
requirement
of
section
403a1
)
of
the
act
that
a
label
statement
be
truthful
and
not
misleading
.
thus
,
all
of
the
statements
mentioned
by
the
comments
would
not
be
health
claims
because
they
do
not
address
a
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
as
defined
under
§
101
14
.
the
agency
has
provided
a
lengthy
and
detailed
discussion
on
what
types
of
statements
constitute
health
claims
in
the
health
claims
final
rule
at
the
pages
cited
above
.

.
a
few
comments
asked
whether
fda
would
remove
or
prohibit
the
publishing
of
books
containing
information
on
health
claims
and
argued
that
such
regulations
would
clearly
be
unconstitutional
.
other
comments
addressed
the
issue
of
whether
fdas
health
claims
regulations
for
dietary
supplements
would
apply
to
advertising
.
one
of
these
comments
interpreted
an
excerpt
from
the
report
of
fdas
task
force
on
dietary
supplements
as
an
attempt
to
disallow
the
use
of
unapproved
health
claims
in
magazines
,
newsletters
,
or
other
media
channels
unless
the
information
has
been
preapproved
by
fda
.
that
excerpt
reads
:
the
task
force
considered
various
issues
in
its
deliberations
,
including
how
to
assure
the
safety
of
dietary
supplements
;
how
to
limit
the
potential
for
fraud
,
ie
,
disease
claims
made
on
labels
or
through
other
means
,
eg
,
magazine
articles
,
newsletters
,
and
advertisements
*

*
*
*
.
the
comment
further
asserted
that
this
same
intent
is
reflected
in
the
health
claim
regulations
proposed
in
november
1991
.
the
comment
stated
that
this
broadbased
broad
based
application
of
the
health
claims
regulations
would
severely
jeopardize
the
reporting
of
health
and
diseaserelated
disease
related
information
in
almost
every
form
of
media
,
would
inhibit
the
evolution
of
scientific
knowledge
,
would
have
a
significant
negative
impact
on
the
public
health
of
america
,
and
was
likely
unconstitutional
.
fda
advises
that
the
provisions
of
this
regulation
pertain
only
to
a
products
label
and
labeling
.
this
regulation
does
nothing
to
censor
the
content
of
books
,
magazines
,
or
advertising
.
this
regulation
also
does
not
in
any
way
regulate
the
availability
of
books
,
magazines
,
or
advertising
.
however
,
firms
sometimes
choose
to
use
such
material
as
labeling
for
their
products
,
and
if
used
as
such
,
the
material
would
be
subject
to
this
regulation
.
for
example
,
sometimes
firms
copy
an
article
from
a
magazine
and
display
that
article
with
a
product
that
is
offered
for
sale
.
under
such
circumstances
,
the
article
would
be
a
part
of
the
labeling
of
that
product
.
what
is
significant
to
note
is
that
these
regulations
in
no
way
limit
what
articles
may
be
published
,
or
what
books
may
be
printed
.
they
limit
only
the
claims
that
may
be
made
in
the
labeling
of
food
products
.
under
the
act
,
advertising
may
provide
objective
evidence
of
what
the
intended
use
of
a
particular
product
is
.
if
the
advertising
reveals
that
the
product
is
intended
to
be
used
as
a
drug
,
the
product
may
be
regulated
as
a
drug
.
in
addition
,
claims
made
in
advertising
may
affect
the
type
of
nutrition
labeling
that
is
provided
(
see
§
1019j
.
claims
made
in
advertising
,
however
,
are
not
subject
to
section
403r1b

of
the
act

thus
,
the
agency
finds
no
merit
in
the
concerns
expressed
by
these
comments

preliminary
requirements
for
a
claim
in
the

rule
,
fda
established
several
criteria
in
§
101
14
)
that
have
to
be
met
before
a
substance
will
qualify
to
be
the
subject
of
a
health
claim
.
the
criteria
provide
that
the

must
:
(

)
be
associated
with
a

health
related
condition
for
which
the

(
alternatively
,
the

may
be
explained

)
be
safe
and
lawful
under
applicable
food
safety
provisions
of
the
act
(
see
§
101
14
.
these
criteria
reflect
not
only
the
requirements
of
section
403r
)
of
the
act
but
also
the
fact
that
fda
is
charged
with
ensuring
that
the
food
supply
is
safe
,
and
that
the
food
label
is
not
misleading
.
given
that
agency
evaluations
of
the
validity
of
a
health
claim
will
be
resource
intensive
,
fda
decided
not
to
undertake
such
evaluations
unless
a
petition
for
a
health
claim
demonstrates
that
the
preliminary
requirements
are
met
.
while
fda
had
proposed
in
november
of
1991
that
these
preliminary
requirements
cover
substances
in
dietary
supplements
as
well
as
foods
in
conventional
food
form
,
the
provisions
of
the
ds
act
precluded
the
agency
from
applying
these
preliminary
requirements
to
substances
in
dietary
supplements
at
the
time
that
the
rule
was
finalized
.
thus
,
the
preliminary
requirements
established
in
the
health
claims
final
rule
apply
only
to
substances
in
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
the
dietary

contained
provisions
to
subject
the
components
of

to
the

)
that
apply
to
any
other

that
is

and

however
,

proposed
to
add

to

a
number
of

some
comments

those

comments

supplements
would
fail
to
meet
this
requirement
because
their
beneficial
effects
on
the
body
often
are
derived
from
substances
unique
to
the
plant
that
do
not
promote
growth
,
replace
loss
of
essential
nutrients
,
or
provide
energy
.
a
few
comments
also
noted
that
many
herbs
contain
insignificant
amounts
of
vitamins
,
minerals
,
and
other
nutrients
.
some
comments
asserted
that
the
adoption
of
any
preliminary
requirement
that
would
automatically
disqualify
herbal
dietary
supplements
from
bearing
health
claims
would
undermine
the
intent
of
congress
to
establish
a
nondrug
review
process
for
health
claims
involving
herbs
.
these
comments
asserted
that

that

can
be

one
comment
asserted
that

the

the

that

it
is
overly
restrictive
to
require

as
it
does
in

that
a

be
a

by
describing
taste
,
aroma
,
and
nutritive
value
as
the
`
primary
'
reasons
for
consuming
food
,
the
nutrilab
court
acknowledged
that
a
food
consumed
for
one
of
these
reasons
might
sometimes
also
be
consumed
for
an
additional
purpose
(

under
nutrilab
,
,
however
,
a
substance
whose
uses
do
not
include
taste
,
aroma
,
or
nutritive
value
is
not
a
food
.
in
§
101
14
,
fda
incorporated
this
common
sense
definition
of
food
and
the
phrase
`
or
any
technical
effect
listed
in
§
1703o
'
which
reflects
the
fact
that
the
definition
of
`
food
'
in
section
201f3
)
of
the
act
includes
`
articles
used
for
components
of
food
'
as
a
preliminary
requirement
to
ensure
that
a
substance
that
is
to
be
the
subject
of
a
health
claim
is
in
fact
a
food
.
this
preliminary
requirement
is
fundamental
because
both
the
component
of
a
food
that
is
the
subject
of
a
health
claim
and
a
component
of
a
drug
have
a
characterizable
relationship
to
a
disease
.
congress
recognized
this
fact
by
creating
an
exception
from
section
201g1b
)
of
the
act
,
in
the
definition
of
`
drug
'
for
foods
that
bear
a
claim
authorized
under
section
403r
)
of
the
act
.
thus
,
it
is
crucial
to
the
continuing
viability
of
the
act
itself
that
the
choice
of
the
test
that
determines
whether
a
claim
that
characterizes
the
relationship
of
a
substance
to
a
disease
can
be
made
be
based
on
the
appropriate
factors
.
under
the
act
,
that
choice
turns
in
part
on
whether
the
substance
is
a
food
.
therefore
,
fda
has
reflected
in
§
101
14
)
the
judicially
recognized
characteristics
of
a
food
.
in
this
regard
,
interested
persons
should
not
presume
that
inclusion
of
the
phrase
`
or
any
technical
effect
listed
in
§
1703o
'
in
§
101
14
)
means
that
substances
that
may
be
classified
within
one
or
more
of
the
categories
of
food
additives
in
§
1703o
)
automatically
meet
this
preliminary
requirement
.
the
classifications
within
§
1703o
)
are
of
a
general
nature
to
reflect
the
uses
to
which
food
ingredients
are
put
.
all
of
the
classifications
pertain
to
the
effect
of
the
ingredients
on
food
(
eg
,
by
affecting
the
texture
of
the
food
)
rather
than
on
the
human
body
.
only
a
substance
that
is
used
for
the
technical
effect
in
§
1703o20
,
that
of
a
nutrient
supplement
,
has
the
potential
to
have
a
useful
effect
in
the
body
because
of
the
characteristics
that
cause
it
to
be
used
in
the
food
.
the
`
nutrient
supplement
'
category
includes
`
substances
which
are
necessary
for
the
bodys
nutritional
and
metabolic
processes
'
as
the
comments
themselves
recognized
,
not
every
component
of
a
dietary
supplement
has
such
an
effect
.
in
view
of
the
agencys
broad
,
flexible
definition
of
`
nutritive
value
'
fda
does
not
find
any
merit
in
arguments
that
the
provisions
requiring
that
a
substance
be
a
food
should
be
removed
.
to
the
contrary
,
fda
believes
that
these
provisions
will
benefit
the
public
health
by
allowing
the
agency
to
devote
its
limited
resources
for
review
of
petitions
to
those
that
are
appropriate
for
consideration
under
the
health
claim
provisions
of
the
act
.
accordingly
,
fda
considers
these
provisions
essential
elements
under
the
framework
that
it
has
created
in
its
regulations
for
the
regulation
of
health
claims
and
fully
consistent
with
the
act
.
fda
disagrees
with
the
comments
'
characterization
of
its
actions
as
an
attack
against
dietary
supplements
.
fda
believes
that
the
combined
effect
of
§
101
14
,
the
preliminary
requirement
that
a
substance
be
a
food
,
and
§
101
14
,
the
definition
of
`
nutritive
value
'
will
not
present
dietary
supplements
with
any
unreasonable
barriers
for
agency
evaluation
of
potential
health
claims
for
components
of
these
products
.
without
question
,
these
provisions
do
restrict
health
claims
to
effects
on
a
disease
or
a
healthrelated
health
related
condition
resulting
from
the
nutritive
value
of
substances
.
however
,
as
one
comment
pointed
out
,
the
current
definition
of
`
nutritive
value
'
in
§
101
14
)
is
broad
enough
to
include
the
functions
of
most
dietary
supplements
.
one
observation
that
might
bear
making
in
this
context
is
that
congress
has
given
the
agency
a
statutory
structure
with
which
to
deal
.
in
relevant
part
,
that
structure
divides
the
world
of
substances
that
have
a
relationship
to
disease
into
foods
and
drugs
.
congress
placed
the
health
claims
provisions
on
the
food
side
of
the
ledger
.
fda
is
charged
with
implementing
those
provisions
in
accordance
with
the
act
and
applicable
legal
precedents
.
fda
has
announced
its
intention
to
implement
the
health
claim
provisions
as
flexibly
as
possible
,
but
at
some
point
the
agency
simply
cannot
be
as
flexible
as
some
of
the
comments
have
suggested
.
at
that
point
,
the
agency
would
start
to
erode
the
scheme
that
the
statute
has
established
for
drugs
.
the
agency
cannot
do
that
.
if
congress
intended
something
that
goes
beyond
the
scheme
that
fda
has
established
in
these
final
regulations
,
then
what
is
required
is
a
change
in
the
law
itself
.
16
.
many
comments
objected
to
the
aspect
of
§
101
14
)
that
requires
that
a
substance
retain
its
food
status
(
ie
,
its
nutritive
value
)
when
consumed
at
levels
that
are
necessary
to
justify
a
claim
.
almost
all
concern
was
directed
toward
consumption
of
substances
at
levels
significantly
higher
than
those
present
in
the
daily
diet
.
some
comments
urged
fda
to
evaluate
proposed
health
claims
involving
relatively
high
levels
of
nutrients
on
the
grounds
that
categorically
prohibiting
them
would
deny
americans
beneficial
information
rather
than
educating
them
on
how
to
alter
their
diets
to
achieve
optimal
health
.
other
comments
stated
that
fdas
categorical
refusal
to
evaluate
such
health
claims
because
of
the
nutrient
levels
involved
would
directly
violate
both
the
proxmire
amendment
and
the
congressional
intent
behind
the
1990
amendments
.
these
comments
noted
that
the
1990
amendments
provide
for
the
appearance
of
health
claims
on
foods
and
stated
that
,
subject
to
certain
conditions
,
the
proxmire
amendments
prohibition
against
regulating
a
vitamin
supplement
as
a
drug
`
solely
because
it
exceeds
the
level
of
potency
which
the
secretary
determines
is
nutritionally
rational
or
useful
'
guarantees
the
regulation
of
vitamins
as
foods
regardless
of
the
levels
of
nutrients
that
they
supply
.
the
comments
also
stated
that
congress
envisioned
the
approval
of
such
health
claims
,
as
it
was
aware
that
dietary
supplements
substantially
in
excess
of
the
us
.
rdas
were
routinely
being
consumed
by
americans
,
and
it
chose
to
direct
that
fda
conduct
a
review
of
antioxidant
vitamins
cancer
claims
with
dietary
supplements
in
mind
.
other
comments
further
asserted
that
fda
was
attempting
to
circumvent
the
proxmire
amendment
and
create
maximum
potency
levels
for
all
supplements
by
establishing
an
upper
limit
for
`
nutritive
value
'
fda
does
not
agree
that
any
conflict
with
section
411
of
the
act
is
presented
by
a
requirement
that
,
to
be
the
subject
of
a
health
claim
,
the
substance
must
be
a
food
,
that
is
,
consumed
primarily
for
its
taste
,
aroma
,
or
nutritive
value
.
there
is
nothing
in
the
health

final
rule
or
in
the
regulations
established
by
this
document
that
will
affect
in
any
way
the
availability
of
dietary

or
consumers
'
freedom
to
choose
to
purchase
them
.
rather
,
the
regulations
that
fda
is
establishing
are
intended
to
ensure
that
any
health
claims
that
may
be
made
for
dietary
supplements
are
scientifically
valid
.
this
is
what
section
403r5d
)
of
the
act
directs
fda
to
do
.
nothing
in
these
regulations
would
necessarily
prevent
a
supplement
from
bearing
a
health
claim
when
it
contains
a
level
of
a
substance
that
exceeds
the
level
achievable
in
the
context
of
the
daily
diet
.
to
the
contrary
,
the
final
rule
concerning
calcium
and
osteoporosis
,
for
example
,
which
was
published
in
the
federal
register
of
01/06/1993
(
58
fr
2665
,
permits
a
calcium
health
claim
for
dietary
supplements
and
requires
only
that
the
supplement
labeling
advise
consumers
,
in
appropriate
circumstances
,
that
there
is
no
known
benefit
from
consuming
more
than
200
percent
of
the
recommended

intake
for

.
section
411
of
the

does
not
authorize
health
claims
for
dietary

or
in
any
way
affect
fdas

)
of
the
act
to
regulate
such
claims
.
under
section
411a1b
)
of
the
act
,
fda
may
not
classify
a
dietary
supplement
as
a
drug
solely
because
it
contains
a
vitamin
or
mineral
at
a
level
that
exceeds
the
level
of
potency
that
the
agency
determines
is
nutritionally
rational
or
useful
.
nothing
in
these
proposed
regulations
would
do
so
.
absent
a
claim
,
fda
will
not
consider
a
dietary
supplement
to
be
a
drug
because
it
contains
vitamins
or
minerals
at
levels
above
those
normally
found
in
food
.
however
,
a
claim
on
a
product
is
an
indication
of
the
products
intended
use
.
if
a
claim
reveals
that
the
product
is
intended
for
a
use
other
than
for
its
taste
,
aroma
,
or
nutritive
value
,
then
nothing
in

of
the

would
require
that
it
be
treated
as
a

.
17
.
many
comments
addressed
the
circumstances
under
which
dietary
supplements
should
be
considered
drugs
.
a
number
of
these
comments
referred
to
the
following
agency
statement
in
the
health
claims
final
rule
(
comment
49
,
58
fr
2478
at
2501
:
a
product
that
is
intended
for
medicinal
effects
,
that
is
,
intended
for
use
in
the
diagnosis
,
cure
,
mitigation
,
treatment
,
or
prevention
of
disease
,
is
a
drug
and
not
a
food
.
thus
,
there
is
no
basis
under
the
act
for
fda
to
permit
health
claims
for
herbs
whose
only
known
use
is
for
medicinal
effects
.
health
benefits
of
such
herbs
may
appear
in
the
labeling
only
in
accordance
with
the
drug
provisions
of
the
act
.
although
a
few
comments
agreed
with
this
statement
,
many
comments
expressed
categorical
opposition
to
the
classification
of
any
herbs
or
other
dietary
supplements
as
drugs
.
while
most
of
these
comments
did
not
offer
reasons
in
support
of
their
position
,
one
comment
expressed
concern
that
such
a
policy
would
be
grounds
for
fda
to
categorically
ban
all
such
supplements
as
unapproved
new
drugs
.
several
comments
noted
that
many
herbs
have
traditionally
been
used
both
as
foods
and
drugs
and
asked
for
assurance
that
fda
would
not
automatically
regulate
such
herbs
as
drugs
.
other
comments
argued
that
herbs
should
always
be
regulated
as
foods
where
they
are
consumed
for
their
nutritive
value
.
some
comments
stressed
that
intended
use
,
as
stated
on
its
labeling
,
should
be
the
determinative
factor
in
deciding
whether
a
supplement
should
be
regulated
as
a
food
or
as
a
drug
.
as
an
example
,
one
of
these
comments
stated
that
a
supplement
marketed
for
a
specific
therapeutic
use
(
eg
,
a
vitamin
c
tablet
sold
to
cure
cancer
)
is
appropriately
regarded
as
a
drug
,
while
a
supplement
sold
to
be
taken
over
a
period
of
time
to
reduce
the
risk
of
developing
a
disease
(
eg
,
a
vitamin
c
tablet
sold
to
be
taken
daily
to
reduce
the
risk
of
cancer
)
should
be
regulated
as
a
food
.
the
comment
asserted
that
this
approach
is
consistent
with
fdas
determination
that
a
supplement
containing
large
amounts
of
niacin
should
be
regulated
as
a
drug
when
consumed
to
lower
serum
cholesterol
.
another
of
these
comments
emphasized
that
a
consumers
use
of
a
legally
labeled
product
should
not
have
any
weight
in
determining
whether
that
product
is
a
drug
.
as
an
example
,
the
comment
noted
that
fda
does
not
regulate
either
fiber
or
water
as
a
drug
as
long
as
their
labeling
does
not
bear
drug
claims
,
even
though
consumers
may
use
them
to
facilitate
bowel
movement
or
to
prevent
,
mitigate
,
or
treat
dehydration
,
respectively
.
a
few
comments
suggested
that
fda
determine
whether
a
substance
is
a
food
or
a
drug
by
its
chemical
composition
.
the
comments
asserted
that
while
the
boundary
between
drugs
and
supplements
is
fuzzy
at
times
,
drugs
are
typically
synthetic
molecules
that
are
of
a
unique
and
patentable
nature
,
while
dietary
supplements
consist
of
natural
,
nonpatentable
materials
.
another
comment
stated
that
fda
should
exempt
substances
taken
to
treat
a
symptom
of
a
disease
from
regulation
as
drugs
,
as
the
act
defines
as
drugs
only
those
substances
used
in
the
diagnosis
,
cure
,
mitigation
,
treatment
,
or
prevention
of
the
disease
itself
.
earlier
in
this
preamble
,
fda
explained
that
these
regulations
do
not
affect
the
availability
of
dietary
supplements
.
again
,
these
regulations
affect
only
the
food
label
and
food
labeling
.
fda
has
no
intention
of
banning
all
dietary
supplements
of
herbs
or
similar
substances
as
unapproved
new
drugs
.
fda
will
carry
out
its
responsibility
to
regulate
inappropriate
claims
,
but
the
agency
will
not
attempt
to
restrict
the
sale
of
dietary
supplements
to
consumers
unless
the
supplements
present
safety
concerns
.
with
respect
to
the
specific
words
for
use
in
labeling
statements
,
fda
advises
that
statements
that
a
product
may
be
effective
in
the
cure
,
mitigation
,
treatment
,
or
prevention
of
disease
will
make
the
product
a
drug
.
however
,
statements
that
a
product
may
reduce
the
risk
of
developing
a
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
may
,
or
may
not
,
make
the
product
a
drug
.
exactly
how
a
substancedisease
substance
disease
relationship
is
to
be
characterized
is
one
of
the
issues
that
the
agency
will
address
in
deciding
whether
to
authorize
a
health
claim
and
how
to
ensure
that
the
claim
describes
the
significance
of
the
substance
in
affecting
the
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
.
fda
points
out
that
as
a
general
matter
,
merely
using
terms
such
as
`
reduce
the
risk
'
instead
of
`
prevent
'
will
not
automatically
make
a
claim
a
health
claim
and
not
a
drug
claim
.
fda
will
make
a
casebycase
case
by
case
assessment
based
on
all
relevant
factors
in
determining
whether
a
claim
is
appropriately
subject
to
the
health
claims
regime
.
the
agency
also
agrees
that
the
main
focus
in
deciding
whether
a
product
is
subject
to
regulation
as
a
food
or
a
drug
is
the
intent
of
the
vendor
and
not
how
consumers
use
the
product
(
although
how
consumers
understand
claims
that
are
made
can
be
used
to
determine
vendor
intent
.
fda
advises
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
act
for
the
agency
to
exempt
statements
about
symptoms
of
disease
from
causing
products
to
be
regulated
as
drugs
.
although
such
statements
may
not
be
claims
that
the
product
will
treat
the
disease
that
causes
the
symptoms
,
the
statements
clearly
pertain
to
the
mitigation
of
disease
by
addressing
the
symptoms
caused
by
the
disease
.
section
201g1b
)
of
the
act
provides
,
in
part
,
that
articles
intended
for
use
in
the
mitigation
of
disease
are
drugs
.
similarly
,
there
is
no
provision
in
the
act
for
fda
to
exempt
natural
,
nonpatentable
materials
from
the
definition
of
a
drug
in
section
201g
)
of
the
act
.
fda
advises
that
it
not
true
that
all
natural
materials
are
not
drugs
.
it
has
been
estimated
that
about
25
percent
of
the
drugs
currently
prescribed
by
physicians
are
plant
compounds
,
and
that
an
additional
25
percent
are
related
to
plants
.
therefore
,
fully
half
of
the
drugs
commonly
used
can
be
considered
plant
derived
.
such
commonly
used
drugs
as
digitalis
,
aspirin
,
quinidine
,
atropine
,
and
hundreds
of
others
were
once
considered
herbals
.
thus
,
the
agency
finds
that
it
cannot
rely
on
the
distinction
of
whether
a
product
is
natural
or
synthetic
in
deciding
whether
it
is
a
food
or
a
drug
.

18
.
many
comments
objected
that
the
proposed
safety
provisions
are
unreasonable
.
a
few
of
these
comments
specifically
asserted
that
herbal
supplements
would
almost
universally
fail
the
proposed
safety
requirements
because
most
herbs
are
not
gras
for
use
as
a
dietary
supplement
,
are
not
approved
food
additives
,
and
are
not
the
subject
of
prior
sanctions
or
are
the
subject
of
prior
sanctions
that
have
been
waived
.
furthermore
,
the
comments
complained
that
fdas
process
for
acting
on
gras
affirmation
petitions
is
notoriously
slow
and
extremely
costly
.
the
comments
maintained
that
the
proposed
safety
requirements
would
discourage
manufacturers
from
submitting
health
claim
petitions
for
dietary
supplements
,
would
delay
the
approval
of
such
petitions
,
and
could
well
amount
to
a
total
ban
on
health
claims
for
certain
dietary
supplements
.
the
comments
suggested
that
fda
require
safety
determinations
only
for
those
substances
with
no
history
of
safe
use
and
provide
that
the
absence
of
known
safety
problems
will
be
sufficient
proof
of
safety
for
substances
with
a
long
history
of
use
.
other
comments
urged
fda
to
be
flexible
in
its
determination
of
safety
for
substances
in
dietary
supplements
.
a
number
of
these
comments
stressed
the
importance
of
fda
recognizing
that
safety
can
be
determined
solely
through
the
historical
use
of
such
substances
.
some
of
the
comments
noted
that
many
components
of
supplements
,
particularly
herbs
,
have
been
used
for
hundreds
or
thousands
of
years
without
safety
problems
.
the
comments
also
noted
that
herbs
are
used
safely
throughout
threefourths
three
fourths
of
the
world
as
a
principal
means
of
medicine
.
the
comments
declared
that
regulatory
authorities
in
great
britain
,
germany
,
japan
,
and
many
other
nations
have
researched
various
herbal
supplements
and
found
them
to
be
safe
when
consumed
at
the
levels
of
use
likely
to
be
contemplated
under
a
health
claim
petition
.
one
comment
also
noted
that
information
concerning
accurate
dosage
,
indications
,
contraindications
,
and
quality
control
measures
are
also
available
in
past
editions
of
the
us
.
pharmacopeias
and
national
formularies
.
these
comments
urged
fda
to
accept
all
relevant
data
on
the
safe
use
of
herbal
dietary
supplements
,
including
foreign
studies
and
monographs
that
evidence
the
safety
of
these
products
.
one
comment
declared
that
fda
is
legally
bound
to
consider
evidence
involving
herb
usage
outside
the
united
states
when
reviewing
the
safety
of
herbs
.
one
comment
asserted
that
fda
should
evaluate
the
safety
of
vitamins
and
minerals
in
terms
of
their
effect
on
the
normal
population
and
not
on
those
consumers
with
unusual
conditions
or
sensitivities
.
the
comment
acknowledged
that
such
consumers
need
clear
label
ingredient
statements
as
well
as
education
on
foods
to
deal
with
their
problems
.
the
comment
asserted
,
however
,
that
these
consumers
should
be
held
responsible
for
some
degree
of
selfprotection
self
protection
.
the
comment
maintained
that
this
approach
is
consistent
with
the
agencys
policy
on
persons
with
allergies
to
food
components
.
a
few
comments
asserted
that
the
safety
of
a
dietary
supplement
should
be
defined
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
harm
may
occur
under
the
conditions
of
use
defined
by
the
supplements
labeling
,
rather
than
in
terms
of
an
arbitrary
cutoff
such
as
the
rdi
.
the
comment
maintained
that
a
systematic
review
of
all
components
of
dietary
supplements
is
not
necessary
and
suggested
that
the
agency
undertake
safety
reviews
on
a
casebycase
case
by
case
basis
where
it
believes
a
potential
safety
concern
might
exist
.
several
comments
asserted
that
fda
is
not
equitable
in
its
concern
for
the
safety
of
dietary
supplements
as
compared
to
the
safety
of
other
products
regulated
by
the
agency
.
some
comments
asserted
that
the
safety
record
of
dietary
supplements
is
far
better
than
many
fdaapproved
fda
approved
food
additives
such
as
aspartame
,
against
which
,
according
to
the
comments
,
the
agency
receives
and
ignores
thousands
of
consumer
complaints
annually
.
other
comments
asserted
that
fdas
intense
interest
in
the
safety
of
products
would
be
better
focused
on
prescription
drugs
,
which
are
responsible
for
over
1/2
million
deaths
annually
as
compared
to
the
no
or
few
deaths
attributable
to
the
consumption
of
dietary
supplements
.
however
,
several
comments
supported
fdas
proposal
to
require
that
petitioners
for
a
health
claim
for
a
substance
in
a
dietary
supplement
demonstrate
that
the
substance
is
safe
and
lawful
.
the
comments
agreed
with
the
agency
that
such
a
requirement
is
implicit
in
the
act
,
and
that
the
labeling
law
in
no
way
diminishes
fdas
responsibility
to
ensure
the
safety
of
foods
.
fda
concludes
that
the
preliminary
requirement
that
the
safety
of
a
substance
be
demonstrated
should
apply
to
substances
in
dietary
supplements
in
the
same
manner
that
it
applies
to
substances
in
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
the
amendment
to
the
act
enacted
by
the
1990
amendments
cannot
be
implemented
independently
of
the
remaining
portions
of
the
act
(
see
section
9
of
the
1990
amendments
.
the
act
must
be
considered
as
a
whole
,
and
fdas
responsibility
for
ensuring
the
safety
of
foods
is
explicitly
provided
for
in
other
sections
of
the
act
(
see
sections
201s
,
402a1
)
and
(
2
,
and
409
of
the
act
.
as
the
agency
explained
in
the
dietary
supplement
health
claims
proposal
,
the
fact
that
the
act
contains
such
explicit
safety
authority
is
particularly
significant
because
the
agency
will
be
specifically
authorizing
the
health
claims
that
will
be
made
.
in
view
of
this
affirmative
action
,
fda
authorization
of
a
health
claim
places
the
agencys
imprimatur
on
the
claim
.
moreover
,
the
claim
will
encourage
consumption
of
the
substance
.
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
agencys
responsibility
under
the
act
to
authorize
a
health
claim
about
a
substance
,
whether
it
be
in
a
dietary
supplement
or
in
food
in
conventional
food
form
,
without
being
satisfied
that
the
use
of
the
substance
is
safe
.
certainly
,
fda
would
have
almost
no
assurance
that
it
would
be
protecting
the
public
health
if
it
permitted
,
as
some
comments
suggest
,
all
substances
except
those
that
are
actually
known
to
cause
safety
problems
to
be
the
subject
of
health
claims
.
it
would
be
a
great
and
tragic
irony
if
substances
that
were
the
subject
of
health
claims
because
of
one
effect
caused
injury
because
of
another
.
this
is
the
situation
that
congress
sought
to
avert
by
including
section
403r3aii
)
in
the
act
.
fdas
preliminary
requirement
is
fully
consistent
with
the
principles
that
underlie
that
section
.
the
fact
that
some
herbs
and
other
ingredients
of
dietary
supplements
have
been
used
for
thousands
of
years
does
not
necessarily
justify
a
conclusion
by
fda
that
their
use
under
all
conditions
is
safe
,
but
it
may
.
first
,
fda
needs
a
basis
for
concluding
that
such
use
was
in
fact
without
harmful
effect
.
second
,
fda
needs
a
basis
for
concluding
that
consumption
of
ingredients
in
a
supplement
carrying
a
health
claim
would
be
in
amounts
comparable
to
those
consumed
safely
in
the
past
.
the
proponents
of
claims
for
such
substances
are
certainly
free
to
demonstrate
that
the
use
of
those
substances
is
generally
recognized
as
safe
based
on
their
common
use
in
food
prior
to
1958
.
the
agency
notes
,
however
,
that
the
use
of
many
of
these
substances
has
been
primarily
as
a
drug
,
tonic
,
or
folk
remedy
,
rather
than
as
food
(
see
53
fr
16544
at
16545
;
05/10/1988
.
this
fact
is
confirmed
by
some
of
the
comments
summarized
above
.
as
drugs
,
the
levels
and
frequency
of
use
of
these
substances
may
have
been
significantly
different
than
the
levels
and
frequency
of
use
that
will
result
from
their
use
as
foods
.
although
the
agency
will
consider
evidence
involving
herb
usage
outside
the
united
states
,
fda
still
needs
to
review
data
on
the
identity
of
the
substance
,
the
safety
of
the
substance
,
the
use
of
the
substance
in
food
,
the
context
of
its
use
,
and
the
frequency
of
use
in
the
country
where
use
of
the
substance
occurred
(
see
50
fr
27294
at
27295
,
07/02/1985
.
evidence
that
another
country
has
studied
the
safety
of
an
herbal
supplement
and
found
it
to
be
safe
would
certainly
be
relevant
and
should
be
submitted
to
fda
.
it
is
important
,
however
,
that
as
much
of
the
evidence
that
provided
the
basis
for
the
countrys
determination
as
is
possible
be
submitted
to
fda
.
although
formal
recognition
of
safety
by
fda
admittedly
can
be
lengthy
and
expensive
,
such
formal
recognition
is
not
required
under
this
preliminary
requirement
.
in
responding
to
concerns
raised
by
comments
suggesting
that
fda
recognize
manufacturers
'
private
gras
determinations
,
the
agency
stated
in
the
health
claims
final
rule
the
following
concerning
§
101
14
)
(
58
fr
2478
at
2502
through
2503
:
fda
acknowledges
that
the
gras
affirmation
and
food
additive
listing
process
can
be
lengthy
.
thus
,
fda
designed
§
101
14
)
to
provide
flexibility
with
respect
to
the
type
of
showing
of
safety
that
is
necessary
to
make
a
substance
eligible
to
be
the
subject
of
a
health
claim
.
gras
affirmation
and
food
additive
listing
are
but
two
of
the
procedures
by
which
a
substance
may
meet
this
preliminary
requirement
.
fda
intends
to
consider
the
basis
of
manufacturers
'
independent
gras
determinations
where
such
determinations
are
submitted
with
petitions
for
health
claims
and
may

its
discretion
to
accept
,
without
formal
affirmation
,
the
independent
determination
of
gras
where
fda
believes
that
such
action
would
be
appropriate
.
as
fda
pointed
out
in
the
previous
comment
,
however
,
the
agency
would
not
be
fulfilling
its
responsibilities
under
the
act
if
it
were
to
permit
a
substance
to
be
the
subject
of
a
health
claim
without
satisfying
itself
that
the
use
of
that
substance
is
safe
.
although
fda
will
consider
all
manufacturers
'
independent
gras
determinations
where
the
basis
for
such
determinations
are
submitted
with
petitions
for
health
claims
,
the
agency
advises
that
it
will
generally
not
be
possible
for
fda
to
judge
whether
gras
determinations
based
on
complex
scientific
evidence
are
valid
within
the
short
timeframes
mandated
under
the
1990
amendments
for
health
claims
petitions
.
instead
,
agency
agreement
with
an
independent
determination
that
a
substance
is
gras
will
be
most
likely
where
the
substance
is
an
ingredient
,
or
a
component
of
a
food
ingredient
,
that
was
in
common
use
in
food
prior
to
01/01/1958
,
in
a
similar
context
.
however
,
where
such
agreement
occurs
,
the
agreement
does
not
constitute
gras
affirmation
.
instead
,
the
history
of
common
use
in
food
,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
fda
knows
of
no
reason
to
question
the
safety
of
the
food
ingredient
,
means
that
the
substance
will
be
treated
as
if
it
is
an
unlisted
gras
substance
(
as
provided
for
in
§
§
170
30
)
and
1821a
)
(
21
cfr

)
and

)
in
the
manner
provided
for
in
the
food
ingredient
list
in
21
cfr
part
182
.
(
58
fr
2478
at
2503
)
under
this
final
rule
,
this
statement
is
fully
applicable
to
substances
in
dietary
supplements
.
the
agency
believes
that
this
policy
on
independent
determinations
that
a
substance
is
gras
demonstrates
that
fda
will
be
flexible
in
assessing
conformance
with
the
safety
preliminary
requirement
.
fda
disagrees
with
assertions
that
the
agency
should
evaluate
the
safety
of
dietary
supplements
in
terms
of
only
the
normal
population
.
it
would
be
unconscionable
for
the
agency
to
adopt
a
policy
of
ignoring
adverse
effects
,
some
of
which
could
be
lifethreatening
life
threatening
,
of
any
foods
,
including
dietary
supplements
,
on
vulnerable
segments
of
the
population
.
furthermore
,
there
is
no
basis
under
the
act
for
such
a
policy
.
fda
does
attempt
,
however
,
to
find
the
most
practicable
solutions
to
assuring
consumers
of
a
safe
food
supply
.
for
example
,
the
agency
generally
does
not
base
safety
decisions
on
atypical
population
subgroups
that
will
use
the
product
.
where
there
are
subgroups
of
consumers
(
eg
,
consumers
with
certain
sensitivities
)
that
could
suffer
adverse
effects
from
consuming
the
product
,
fda
may
place
certain
restrictions
on
the
use
of
the
product
or
rely
on
labeling
solutions
(
such
as
those
the
agency
has
used
for
sulfiting
agents
and
yellow
5
)
as
a
condition
for
its
safe
use
,
rather
than
denying
the
availability
of
the
product
to
the
entire
population
.
thus
,
for
all
the
foregoing
reasons
,
fda
is
making
health
claims
for
substances
in
dietary
supplements
,
like
claims
for
any
other
food
,
subject
to
§
101

.
c
.
scientific
standard
19
.
many
comments
expressed
concern
that
fda
would
apply
the
term
`
significant
scientific
agreement
'
in
an
unreasonable
manner
by
demanding
too
much
supporting
evidence
on
substance
disease
relationships
before
approving
health
claims
.
several
comments
insisted
that
fda
is
misinterpreting
the
requirements
for
the
scientific
standard
for
food
in
conventional
food
form
as
well
as
for
dietary
supplements
.
the
comments
asserted
that
the
law
does
not
require
that
there
be
significant
scientific
agreement
that
a
nutrient
disease
relationship
has
been
conclusively
established
,
but
only
that
the
statements
made
in
a
claim
be
supported
by
the
available
evidence
.
as
an
example
,
one
of
the
comments
asserted
that
the
requirements
of
the
law
would
be
fully
met
by
a
properly
qualified
label
claim
such
as
,
`
although
no
scientific
consensus
has
been
established
,
several
clinical
studies
suggest
that
daily
consumption
of

c
as
part
of
a
wellbalanced
well
balanced
diet
may
reduce
the
frequency
of

'
a
number
of
comments
asserted
that
the
standards
for
authorizing
health
claims
on
foods
are
more
stringent
than
those
authorizing
the
use
of
drug
claims
.
several
comments
argued
that
fda
is
being
unduly
restrictive
by
requiring
that
manufacturers
perform
expensive
randomized
,
doubleblind
double
blind
,
placebocontrolled
placebo
controlled
tests
to
prove
the
validity
of
a
claim
under
the
proposed
regulations
.
these
comments
stated
that
such
requirements
would
deter
manufacturers
from
seeking
new
uses
for
herbs
and
other
substances
used
in
dietary
supplements
.
the
comments
maintained
that
a
more
lenient
standard
would
encourage
manufacturers
to
engage
in
research
to
develop
more
healthful
products
.
the
comments
further
asserted
that
the
disparate
treatment
of
foods
and
drugs
is
especially
unfair
when
the
enormous
difference
in
safety
factors
between
dietary
supplements
and
untested
prescription
drugs
is
considered
.
some
of
the
comments
asserted
that
fda
had
not
been
fair
to
date
in
its
evaluations
of
health
claims
under
this
standard
.
one
of
these
comments
asserted
that
fda
had
approved
only
four
of
the
ten
congressionallyproposed
congressionally
proposed
health
claims
,
not
seven
,
as
fda
claimed
in
the
preamble
to
the
proposed
regulations
.
some
comments
maintained
that
fda
should
not
require
a
unanimous
or
nearunanimous
near
unanimous
consensus
among
experts
in
order
to
find
that
there
is
`
significant
scientific
agreement
'
concerning
a
claim
.
a
few
of
the
comments
pointed
out
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
1990
amendments
clearly
indicates
that
such
a
level
of
agreement
is
not
to
be
required
.
other
comments
urged
that
fda
consider
the
requirement
for
`
significant
scientific
agreement
'
to
be
satisfied
as
long
as
there
is
agreement
among
a
majority
of
scientists
familiar
with
the
research
in
a
given
area
.
these
comments
noted
that
commissioner

offered
testimony
supporting
this
interpretation
before

of
representatives

on
health

other
comments
maintained
that
the
requirement
for
`
significant
scientific
agreement
'
only
requires
agreement
among
a
significant
number
of
qualified
experts
.
one
of
these
comments
requested
that
fda
include
a
provision
in
the
regulations
that
the
standard
of
`
significant
scientific
agreement
'
is
not
one
of
unanimity
to
prevent
confusion
among
manufacturers
and
consumers
.
a
few
comments
asked
that
fdas
regulations
include
a
provision
that
guarantees
that
`
significant

be
considered
to
have
been
achieved
when
a
credible
health
authority

an

,
recommends
the
consumption
of
a
nutrient
because
of
its
relationship
to
a

or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
.
one
comment
suggested
that
fda
not
use
the
phrase
`
significant
scientific
agreement
'
to
evaluate
proposed
health
claims
,
despite
its
inclusion
in
the
language
of
the
1990
amendments
,
because
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
is
ambiguous
.
the
comment
suggested
that
fda
should
simply
consider
the
totality
of
publicly
available
scientific
evidence
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
particular
health
claim
can
be
justified
.
fda
disagrees
with
assertions
that
it
is
conducting
validity
assessments
for
health
claims
in
an
unduly
restrictive
manner
.
fda
does
not

with
this

fda

fda
believes
that
these
approvals
demonstrate
that
it
is
not
conducting
validity
assessments
for
health
claims
in
an
unduly
restrictive
manner
.
fda
agrees
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
1990

makes
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
,
in
calling
for
significant
scientific
agreement
about
the
support
for
a
claim
,
to
require
that
such
agreement
represents
a
full
consensus
among

the

states
:

the

does
not
require
that
there
be
a
unanimous

instead
there
must
be
a
significant
agreement
among
experts
,
but
it
does
not
require
that
every
expert
in
the
field
approve
or
agree
with
the
claim
.
the
agency
shares
the
comments
'
concern
that
a
requirement
of
consensus
would
mean
that
some
valid
health
claims
would
not
be
authorized
and
,
by
restricting
such
claims
,
would
counter
congress
'
intent
that
health
claims
supported
by
a
significant
scientific
agreement
be
made
available
to

.
the
agency
never
intended
to
require
that
claims
be
supported
by
a
consensus
among
scientists
and
has
not
done
so
.
the

is
sensitive
to
the
comments
'
perception
that
the
scientific
standard
,
particularly
the
phrase

the

believes
,
however
,
that

derived
from

that

the
agency
believes
that
in
deciding
whether
significant

about
the
validity
of
a
claim
exists
,
it
is
necessary
to
consider
both
the
extent
of

and
the
nature
of
the
disagreement
on
a
casebycase
case

case
basis
.
the
house
report
(

.
1
)
makes
clear
that
congress
intended
the
`
significant
scientific
agreement
'
standard
to
be
a
flexible
one
by
pointing
out
that
,
in
reviewing
scientific
studies
,
fda
may
give
greater
weight
to
the
studies
that
it
finds
more
persuasive
.
the
house
report
also
clarifies
that
the
overriding
consideration
in
assessing
whether
to
authorize
a
claim
should
be
the
secretarys
level
of
comfort
about
the
validity
of
the
claim
.
the
agency
believes
that
this
clarification
provides
clear
guidance
for
the
application
of
the
standard
,
and
thus
it
is
not
incorporating
the
changes
requested
by
the
comments
in
the
codified
language
of
the
regulations
.
fda
does
not
believe
it
has
in
any
way
been
unfair
in
its
approval
of
health
claims
to
date
.
earlier
in
this
preamble
in
response
to
comment
2
,
fda
explained
why
certain
specific
health
claims
were
not
approved
.
nevertheless
,
the
agencys
statement
in
the
dietary
supplement
health
claims
proposal
that
it
had
authorized
claims
on
7
of
the
10
nutrientdisease
nutrient
disease
relationships
is
correct
.
in
the
case
of
3
of
the
relationships
,
however
,
the
claims
were
authorized
for
foods
rather
than
specific
nutrients
.
in
these
cases
,
as
explained
previously
,
although
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
attribute
certain
disease
risk
reductions
to
the
consumption
of
certain
foods
,
and
those
foods
are
marked
by
significant
levels
of
the
nutrients
in
question
,
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
attribute
any
disease
risk
reduction
directly
to
consumption
of
the
nutrients
themselves
.
fda
does
not
agree
that
it
should
define
`
significant
scientific
agreement
'
as
agreement
among
a
majority
of
scientists
familiar
with
the
issues
.
commissioner
kesslers
statements
about
significant
scientific
agreement
being
50
or
60
percent
agreement
were
intended
to
show
the
contrast
between
this
term
and
the
term
`
consensus
'
not
to
provide
a
specific
definition
of
`
significant
scientific
agreement
'
there
is
simply
no
bright
line
that
fda
can
draw
in
this
area
.
ultimately
,
the
agency
must
exercise
its
scientific
judgment
,
arrived
at
after
input
from
the
scientific
community
.
the
agency
does
not
agree
that
significant
scientific
agreement
should
be
considered
to
have
been
achieved
when
a
credible
health
authority
,
particularly
an
agency
of
the
us
.
government
,
recommends
the
consumption
of
a
nutrient
because
of
its
relationship
to
a
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
.
while
fda
recognizes
the
significance
of
such
recommendations
,
congress
charged
fda
with
the
responsibility
of
authorizing
health
claims
on
the
food
label
and
labeling
.
nonetheless
,
the
agency
is
mindful
of
the
admonition
in
section
403r4c
)
of
the
act
that
reads
:
`
if
a
petition

one
comment
stated
that
fda
should
mandate
that
dietary

bear
health
claims
for
which
they
are
eligible
in
order
to
promote
public
awareness
of
the
benefits
associated
with
those
supplements
.
fda
does
not
believe
that
it
is
appropriate
to
adopt
a
general
policy
requiring
the
inclusion
of
health
claims
on
the
labels
of
all
foods
eligible
to
bear
them
.
the
agency
notes
that
while
the
1990
amendments
provide
for
the
appearance
of
health
claims
on
the
labels
of
foods
qualified
to
bear
them
,
they
do
not
make
the
appearance
of
those
claims
mandatory
.
fda
believes
that
many
manufacturers
will
choose
to
include
health
claims
on
the
labels
of
qualified
foods
because
of
the
marketing
benefit
offered
by
their
appearance
.
because
health
claims
provide
information
regarding
the
benefits
associated
with
the
increased
or
decreased
dietary
intake
of
various
substances
in
the
product
rather
than
information
regarding
the
particular
product
itself
,
consumers
will
be
made
aware
of
the
benefits
of
consuming
other
foods
that
do
or
do
not
contain
the
particular
substance
,
even
if
a
particular
food
product
does
not
itself
bear
the

one
comment
asserted
that
fda
should
require
manufacturers
who
elect
to
craft
their
own
health
claims
,
rather
than
to
use
the
model

to
secure

the

(

states
that
this
section
`
makes
it
clear
that
the
regulations
will
not
require
premarket
review
of

they
will
only

the
claim
be
consistent
with
the
terms

the
agency
believes
that
it
is
possible
to
paraphrase
a
model
health
claim
while
remaining
consistent
with
the
terms
and
requirements
of
the
regulations
permitting
that
claim
.
this
position
is
similar
to
agency
policy
that
permits
the
use
of
terminology
other
than
that
established
in
a
final
otc
drug
monograph
in
labeling
of
an
otc
drug
product

describe
indications
for

consistent
with
that
policy
for
otc
drug
labeling
,
the
agency
believes
that
the
goal
of
ensuring
scientifically
valid
,
truthful
,
and
nonmisleading
labeling
without
inhibiting
effective
consumer
communication
does
not
require
exclusive
use
of
language
in
a
model
health
claim
.
the
model
language
along
with
other
requirements
for
a
claim
will
,
nevertheless
,
provide
the
standard
for
measuring
the
accuracy
of
alternative
language
developed
by
food
manufacturers
for
their
products
because
fda
has
included
all
mandatory
labeling
elements
of
a
health
claim
in
the
model
claim
.
of
course
,
manufacturers
should
recognize
that
a
health
claim
that
fails
to
convey
all
the
mandatory
elements
of
the
claim
will
subject
a

the

the

tentatively
concluded

was
appropriate

:
(

reflect
the
statutory
restriction
in

and
(

reduce
the
potential

there
would
be

substances
when
they
are
present
in

not
when
they
are
present

the
agency
advised
that
specific
references
to

generally
are
not
necessary

the

reviews
these

takes

the

how

the

this

stresses
the
importance
of
selecting
foods
so
that
dietary
sources
of
calories
are
coupled
with
sources
of
nutrients
.
this
approach
incorporates
established
levels
of
significance
for

and
is
based
on
the
amounts
in
foods
of
certain
nutrients
required
to
be
listed
on
the
label
as
part
of
mandatory
nutrition
labeling

as
such
,
this
approach
applies
to
food
in

fda
specifically
exempted
dietary

from
this
requirement
.
such

are
intended
only
to

they
make
no

it
would
not
be
logical
to
hold

ensure
consistency
with

accordingly

fda

make
any
change
in
the
exemption
for

fda
proposed
to
revise
the
wording

delete
the
phrase

one
comment
asserted
that
fda
should
allow
health
claims
authorized
for
use
on
dietary
supplements
to
also
appear
on
otc

products
that
provide
`
high
'
levels
of
a
particular
nutrient
,
eg
,
calciumosteoporosis
calcium
osteoporosis
claims
on
calcium
carbonate
antacid
tablets
.
fda
received
a
comment
similar
to
this
one
on
the
health
claims
proposal
.
this
comment
provides
no
basis
for
the
agency
to
provide
a
different
response
to
this
comment
than
it
did
in
the
health
claims
final
rule
.
as
explained
in
the
preamble
of
the
health
claims
final
rule
(
58
fr
2478
at
2500
,
multiple
use
products
that
are
both
foods
and
drugs
present
a
difficult
set
of
competing
concerns
for
the
agency
.
such
products
are
likely
to
be
both
an
otc
drug
and
a
dietary
supplement
.
most
otc
drug
products
are
developed
to
address
some
type
of
acute
medical
problem
that
is
expected
to
be
of
short
duration
.
if
the
problem
persists
,
it
is
important
that
the
person
with
the
problem
know
that
it
may
be
more
severe
than
he
or
she
otherwise
thought
,
and
that
he
or
she
should
seek
medical
attention
.
labeling
on
such
products
,
therefore
,
includes
instructions
to
use
the
product
for
a
limited
period
of
time
and
,
if
the
problem
persists
,
to
seek
medical
intervention
.
thus
,
the
time
limits
on
use
of
the
product
are
important
to
the
health
of
the
users
.
dietary
supplements
,
on
the
other
hand
,
are
developed
for
inclusion
in
a
daily
diet
at
levels
that
are
consistent
with
dietary
use
and
may
often
be
consumed
throughout
most
of
a
persons
lifetime
.
labeling
on
dietary
supplements
contains
no
instructions
for
seeking
medical
intervention
or
for
limiting
the
duration
of
consumption
of
the
supplement
.
rather
,
under
the
new
regulations
,
dietary
supplements
will
be
able
to
bear
nutrient
content
and
health
claims
,
which
focus
the
consumers
attention
on
the
advantages
that
consuming
the
product
will
have
in
helping
the
consumer
to
maintain
a
healthy
diet
.
moreover
,
where
the
supplement
bears
a
health
claim
,
the
claim
will
contain
information
about
how
longterm
long
term
ingestion
of
the
supplement
may
promote
health
.
where
dietary
levels
and
therapeutic
levels
differ
(
as
is
generally
the
case
and
is
in
fact
the
case
with
antacids
and
calcium
supplements
,
an
apparent
conflict
is
created
when
both
food
and
drug
labeling
appear
on
the
same
product
.
in
the
case
of
the
drug
labeling
,
consumers
are
given
directions
for
use
that
involve
high
consumption
during
a
limited
time
period
.
in
the
case
of
the
food
labeling
,
consumers
are
given
directions
for
lower
consumption
with
no
time
constraints
.
even
though
label
instructions
may
identify
those
directions
for
food
and
drug
use
in
separate
locations
,
fda
is
concerned
that
consumers
will
incorrectly
assume
that
the
therapeutic
dosage
is
appropriate
for
dietary
use
,
and
that
the
directions
for
food
use
will
undercut
the
warning
in
the
drug
labeling
to
seek
medical
care
if
the
condition
persists
.
where
the
labeling
is
not
properly
followed
,
significant
adverse
consequences
may
result
.
the
agency
knows
of
no
broad
approach
that
it
can
use
to
harmonize
a
nutrient
content
claim
or
a
health
claim
with
drug
labeling
.
a
drug
that
is
labeled
with
instructions
for
use
that
both
limit
and
do
not
limit
consumption
would
be
misbranded
under
section
502a
)
of
the
act
(
21
usc
.
352a
)
if
it
failed
to
contain
a
material
factthat
is
,
how
to
reconcile
these
conflicting
instructions
.
however
,
fda
does
not
believe
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
preclude
such
claims
under
all
circumstances
.
such
claims
may
be
permissible
if
a
firm
can
demonstrate
that
dual
claims
can
be
made
in
a
manner
that
will
neither
misbrand
the
product
nor
create
a
safety
problem
.
the
agency
suggests
that
anyone
desiring
to
make
a
health
claim
or
a
nutrient
content
claim
that
complies

403r

a
number
of
comments
urged
fda
to
streamline
its
procedures
for
approving
health
claims
in
order
that
dietary
supplement
manufacturers
may
include
the
most
current
,
reliable
information
on
their
products
.
the
comments
stated
that
the
inclusion
of
such
information
is
critically
important
to
dietary
supplements
because
,
unlike
foods
in
conventional
food
form
,
they
are
consumed
only
for
the
health
benefits
associated
with
them
.

fda

authorizing
the
requested
use
of
the
claim
no
later
than
60
days
from
the

and
will
issue
a
final
rule
no
later
than
60
days
from
the
date
of

of
the
proposed

the
comments
maintained
that
new
provision
in
paragraph
(
j4
)
would
correct
an
obvious
oversight
in
the
existing
regulations
,
ie
,
the
establishment
of
a
firm
deadline
for
a
proposed
rule
but
no
firm
deadline
for
a
final
rule
.
the
comments
also
contended
that
paragraph
(
j5
)
is
necessary
to
address
fdas
failure
to
act
promptly
to
approve
claims
that
are
based
on
the
recommendations
of
public
health
authorities
,
such
as
its
failure
to
approve
a
health
claim
for
folic
acid
in
accord
with
the
recommendations
of
phs
agencies
.
fda
advises
that
its
failure
to
specify
in
§
101
70
)
a
deadline
for
the
publication
of
a
final
rule
regarding
the
use
of
a

claim
was
not
an
oversight
.
section

)
does
not
require
that
the
agency
adhere
to
any
deadline
for
the
publication
of
a
final
rule
.
while
fda
could
establish
such
a
timeframe
by
regulation
,
it
does
not
believe
that
the
adoption
of
such
a
requirement
would
be
prudent
.
the
comment
period
following
the
publication
of
proposed
rules
is
a
critical
step
in
determining
whether
a
proposed
regulation
is
appropriate
for
adoption
.
in
the
instance
of
health
claim
regulations
,
significant
information
concerning
the
validity
of
the
substancedisease
substance
disease
relationship
underlying
the
proposed
health
claim
may
be
submitted
by
interested
parties
during
the
comment
period
.
also
,
the
comment
period
may
bring
to
light
a
previously
unforeseen
potential
for
the
use
of
a
health
claim
,
if
adopted
without
modification
,
to
be
misleading
to
consumers
or
to
create
serious
potential
threats
to
the
public
health
.
the
agency
has
no
way
to
guarantee
that
it
will
be
able
to
adequately
resolve
such
problems
within
the
suggested
timeframe
.
in
such
instances
,
if
faced
with
a
specific
timeframe
,
fda
would
be
forced
to
either
deny
an
otherwise
valid
health
claim
petition
,
or
to
approve
it
without
erecting
the
regulatory
framework
that
it
believes
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
public
health
is
safeguarded
.
therefore
,
fda
is
not
adopting
the
suggested
time
limit
on
the
issuance
of
a
final
rule
.
however
,
the
agency
advises
that
it
committed
to
issuing
final
rules
on
health
claim
petitions
as
quickly
as
possible
consistent
with
the
issues
presented
and
the
agencys
available
resources
.
with
respect
to
suggestions
for
shorter
timeframes
for
certain
petitions
,
fda
advises
that
the
agencys
ability
to
meet
timeframes
is
influenced
by
many
factors
,
such
as
work
priorities
and
availability
of
personnel
.
fda
considers
the
statutory
timeframes
for
assessing
the
validity
of
health
claims
and
for
issuing
a
proposed
regulation
to
be
extremely
short
,
given
the
need
to
evaluate
the
totality
of
available
scientific
evidence
on
a
substance
and
a
disease
or
a
healthrelated
health
related
condition
.
given
the
agencys
limited
resources
,
it
would
not
be
practicable
to
shorten
these
timeframes
further
.
however
,
fda
points
out
that
although
action
on
petitions
for
most
claims

nothing
would
prohibit
the
agency
from
acting
in
less
time
than
the
timeframes
provide
if
it
is
possible
to
do
so
.
thus
,
it
is
likely
that
a
petition
for
a

on
a
wellaccepted
well
accepted
substance

would
be
reviewed
more
expeditiously
than

a
few
comments
urged
fda
to
consider
the
limited
label
space
available
on
many
dietary
supplements
in
developing
model
health
claims
.
the
comments
stated
that
concise
model
claims
will
provide
guidance
to
manufacturers
on
how
to
convey
health
claims
in
succinct
statements
that
comply
with
all
of
fdas
requirements
and
will
thus
help
ensure
that
the
health
claims
presented
to
consumers
are
clear
and
comprehensible
.
fda
realizes
that
there
is
a
limit
to
the
amount
of
information
that
can
be
presented
on
a
food
label
.
however
,
the
agency
believes
that
it
must
ensure
that
consumers
understand
that
factors
other
than
dietary
intake
of
the
nutrient
may
bear
on
the
substancedisease
substance
disease
relationship
.
given
the
imperative
of
ensuring
consumer
understanding
of
a
message
that
must
be
presented
in
a
very
limited
space
,
the
agency
is
faced
with
the
difficult
task
of
determining
what
information
is
necessary
in
a
claim
,
and
what
information
is
not
.
fda
believes
that
its
regulations
in
subpart
e
of
21
cfr
part
101
represent
an
acceptable
balance
between
the
consumers
right
to
understand
the
full
context
of
the
claim
and
the
manufacturers
concern
over
claim
length
.
by
delineating
the
information
that
is
mandatory
and
optional
in
a
claim
,
fda
is
relieving
manufacturers
from
having
to
include
information
that
is
of
tangential
importance
but
ensuring
that
those
who
wish
to
make
a
claim
do
so
in
a
manner
that
provides
a
useful
and
understandable
message
to
consumers
.
fda
advises
that
it
will
take
a
similar
approach
when
providing
model
health
claims
in
the
future
.
fda
also
notes
that
manufacturers
who
are
not
satisfied
with
the
model
claim
are
free
to
develop
their
own
versions
of
the
claim
,
provided
that
those
versions
include
all
of
the
information
required
by
the
authorizing
regulation
.
29
.
several
comments
raised
the
issue
of
productspecific
product
specific
health
claims
by
asserting
that
many
manufacturers
will
be
dissuaded
from
undertaking
the
scientific
studies
and
other
investments
necessary
to
obtain
approval
of
new
health
claims
petitions
by
the
fact
that
approved
health
claims
will
be
allowed
for
use
on
all
qualifying
products
.
however
,
a
number
of
comments
stressed
that
in
a
health
claim
,
the
role
of
the
total
diet
should
be
emphasized
rather
than
the
role
of
a
specific
food
in
risk
reduction
.
fda
advises
that
section
403r1b
)
of
the
act
pertains
to
a
claim
about
the
relationship
between
a
nutrient
and
a
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
,
rather
than
about
particular
food
product
and
such
a
condition
.
while
the
agency
has
used
the
term
`
substance
'
in
lieu
of
the
word
`
nutrient
'
and
has
said
that
a
`
substance
'
can
be
a
food
,
in
doing
so
the
agency
was
only
trying
to
cover
circumstances
such
as
those
presented
by
fruits
,
vegetables
,
and
grain
products
in
which
it
was
not
possible
to
identify
the
specific
nutrient
in
a
broad
class
of
foods
that
was
having
the
observed
effect
on
the
risk
of
disease
.
fda
was
not
thereby
including
formulated
products
as
possible
subjects
of
health
claims
.
such
products
are
formulated
to
include
particular
substances
because
of
the
nutritional
effects
of
those
substances
.
thus
,
a
health
claim
for
such
a
product
would
appropriately
be
about
the
substance
in
the
formulated
product
and
not
about
the
product
itself
.
in
addition
,
section
403r3biii
)
of
the
act
directs
the
agency
to
require
that
health
claims
enable
the
public
to
understand
the
information
in
the
context
of
the
total
daily
diet
.
as
explained
above
,
fda
finds
that
to
effect
congress
'
intent
in
passing
the
1990
amendments
,
the
same
requirement
should
apply
to
health
claims
made
on
dietary
supplements
.
fda
believes
that
a
claim
that
refers
specifically
to
the
effects
on
a
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
resulting
from
the
consumption
of
a
certain
brand
name
of
product
would
unduly
emphasize
the
importance
of
that
product
and
not
the
importance
of
the
total
daily
diet
.
also
,
such
claims
could
imply
that
other
brands
of
the
same
food
,
as
well
as
other
foods
containing
the
substance
that
is
the
subject
of
the
claim
,
might
not
have
the
same
effect
on
the
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
and
thus
would
be
misleading
under
section
403a
)
of
the
act
.
accordingly
,
the
agency
finds
that
it
is
not
appropriate
to
approve

one
comment
suggested
that
fda
provide
regular
monthly
or
quarterly
reports
concerning
newly
approved
health
claim
petitions
for
display
in
the
supplement
section
of
stores
.
the
comment
maintained
that
such
a
list
distributed
by
fda
would
increase
consumer
confidence
in
the
claims
when
they
appear
on

labels
.
although
fda
recognizes
that
there
could
be
benefits
to
consumers
from
such
reports
,
the
agency
simply
does
not
have
the
resources
to
provide

on
an
ongoing

fda
expects
that

ultimately
be
passed

in
detail
the
first

implications
of
its
regulation
of
health

on

and
in

the

concluded
that
its

the

the

that

disputed

fda

with
the

that
asserted
that
these

unconstitutionally
suppress

the

.
indeed
,
far
from
limiting
the
dispersal
of

,
as
stated
above
,
these

,
which
implement
the
1990
amendments
to
the

,
permit
more

the

allowed
before
its

.
the

not

a
few
comments
objected
to
the
period
of
time
provided
for
public
comment
on
the
proposal
,
stating
that
it
was
too
short
.
one
of
these
comments
asserted
that
fda
had
no
reason
to
establish
such
a
short
deadline
other
than
to
curtail
public
input
on
the
proposed
regulations
.
another
of
these
comments
requested
that
fda
extend
the
period
for
public
comment
on
the
proposed
regulations
to
give
consumer
advocacy
groups
,
health
care
professionals
,
and
the
scientific
community
adequate
time
to
prepare
the
information
and
opinions
needed
to
fairly
resolve
the
issues
associated
with
the
proposal
.
as
explained
in
the
preamble
of
the
proposals
,
the
ds
act
requires
that
final
rules
implementing
the
1990
amendments
with
respect
to
dietary
supplements
be
issued
by
12/31/1993
.
to
meet
this
statutory
timeframe
,
fda
was
forced
to
limit
the
comment
period
for
the
proposed
regulations
to
60
days
.
thus
,
the
agency
reaffirms
that
it
is
unable
to
grant
any
extensions
to
the
comment
period
.
34
.
one
comment
requested
that
fda
clarify
that
the
compliance
date
is
the
date
on
which
manufacturers
of
dietary
supplements
must
begin
to
label
products
in
accordance
with
§

that

a
number
of
comments
concerned
the
requirement
in

that
states
that
all
claims
must
appear
in
one
place
,
in
the
same
type
size
,
without
intervening
material
.
the
comments
addressed
the
exception
in
this
provision
that
a
short
reference
statement
may
appear
on
the
label
,
`
see
_
_
for
information
about
the

with
the
blanks
filled
in
with
references
to
the
location
of
the

on
which
the
full
claim
appears
,
the
name
of
the
substance
,
and
the
disease
or
healthrelated
health
related
condition
.
the
comment
requested
that
fda
allow
graphic
material
constituting
an
implied
health
claim
to
appear
on
the
pdp
without
the
accompanying
referral
statement
or
full
health
claim
,
as
long
as
the
graphic
material
appeared
in
conjunction
with
the
full
health
claim
elsewhere
on
the
labeling
.
the
comment
justified
this
request
based
on
the
lack
of
sufficient
label
space
on
the
pdp
for
the
referral
statement
.
fda
does
not
believe
that
it
should
make
the
requested
revision
in
§
101
14
.
in
situations
where
graphic
material
constitutes
an
implied
health
claim
,
and
the
reference
statement
is
not
present
,
the
graphic
material
on
the
labeling
is
in
fact
a
shortened
form
of
the
health
claim
.
fda
explained
in
response
to
comment
69
in
the
health
claims
final
rule
that
shortened
health
claims
are
misleading
because
they
do
not
include
facts
that
are
material
in
light
of
the
representation
that
is
made
and
that
are
necessary
to
understand

thus
,
the

concluded
that
