of
all
the
issues
pertaining
to
7104a1
,
the
issue
of
organizational
representation
has
engendered
the
greatest
confusion
and
disagreement
among
the
lower
federal
courts
.
courts
considering
the
question
have
applied
a
variety
of
modes
of
analysis
,
either
singly
or
in
combination
.
the
department
believes
the
best
approach
is
that
adopted
by
those
courts
that
have
attempted

the
department
believes
that
the
`
control
group
'
approach
most
accurately
reflects
the
values
underlying
dr
7104a1
)
and
rule
42
.
this
approach
properly
seeks
to
identify
those
employees
who
exercise
such
sufficient
authority
within
the
organization
that
communications
with
them
should
be
regarded
as
communications
with
the
organization
itself
.
the
department
also
believes
that
the
alternative
approaches
would
impose
unacceptable
constraints
on
federal
law
enforcement
.
paragraph
(
b
:
communications
with
former
employees
;
organizational
representation
this
paragraph
authorizes
communications
with
former
employees
of
represented
organizations
.
because
former
employees
do
not
direct
the
affairs
of
the
organization
and
therefore
cannot
be
considered
members
of
the
`
control
group
'
or
any
other
controlling
entity
of
an
organization
,
communications
with
them
are
not
considered
communications
with
the
organization
for
purposes
of
the
proposed
rule
.
this
reasoning
is
consistent
with
the
conclusion
of
the
majority
of
federal
courts
that
have
held
that
dr
7104a1
)
does
not
bar
communications
with
former
employees
of
a
represented
corporate
party
