for
class
i
asbestos
work
,
osha
has
further
determined
,
based
on
its
consideration
of
the
rulemaking
record
,
that
there
are
3
exceptions
to
the
requirement
that
the
shower
facility
be
located
immediately
contiguous
to
the
work
area
.
these
include
,
outdoor
work
(
see
ex
.
721
,
799
,
7145
,
shipboard
work
(
ex
.
777
and
see
discussion
below
,
and
situations
where
the
employer
shows
such
an
arrangement
is
infeasible
.
osha
will
again
allow
in
these
limited
circumstances
the
workers
to
enter
the
equipment
room
,
remove
contamination
from
their
worksuits
using
a
portable
hepa
vacuum
or
change
to
a
clean
noncontaminated
contaminated
workclothing
,
and
then
proceed
to
the
noncontiguous
contiguous
shower
area
.
outdoor
work
affected
by
this
requirement
will
occur
mainly
in
industrial
facilities
such
as
refineries
and
electrical
power
plants
when
specified
work
practices
are
employed
and
following
outdoor
asbestos
work
.
osha
intends
that
hepavacuuming

be
performed
carefully
and
completely

than
10

or
25

(
the
thresholds
referenced
above
,
during
which
exposures
are
unlikely
to
exceed
the

for
which
there
is
a
negative

assessment
,
osha
is
allowing
less
burdensome
decontamination
procedures
which
it
believes
are
compatible
with
the
scheme
to
classify
asbestos
work
according
to
risk
potential
.
in
these
operation
,
an
equipment
room
or
area
must
be
set
up
adjacent
to
the
work
area
for
decontamination
use
.
the
floor
of
the
area
room
must
be
covered
with
an
impermeable
(
eg
,
plastic
)
dropcloth
and
be
large
enough
to
accommodate
equipment
cleaning
and
removal
of
ppe
without
spread
of
fibers

the
worker
must
hepa
vacuum
workclothing
,
hair
,

as
described
above
and
dispose
of
clothing

properly
.
thus
,
only
if
the
employer
shows
that
for
these
smaller

that
the

unlikely
to
be

may
the
decontamination
procedure
be
abbreviated

for

operations
which
are

are
likely
to

the

and
for
which
a

assessment
is
not
produced

as

or
the
donning

required
.
following
those
class
ii
,
iii
and
iv
jobs
which
the
employer
demonstrates
are
unlikely
to
exceed
the

and
for
which
a
negative

has
been
produced
,
the
worker
must
hepa
vacuum
his
clothing
on
an
impermeable
dropcloth
and
perform
other
cleanup
clean
on
the
dropcloth
avoiding
the
spread
of
any
contamination

however
,
showering
is
not
required
.
osha
is
also
concerned
that
workers
performing
cleanup
clean
(
class
iv
work
)
following
larger
abatement
work
receive
appropriate
decontamination
.
therefore
,
employees
who
perform
class
iv
work
in
a
regulated
area
must
comply
with
the
hygiene
practice
which
the
higher
classification
of
work
being
performed
in
the
regulated

requires

shipyard

standards
;
paragraph
(
i
)
in
other
comments
the
shipyards
employment
standards
advisory
committee
objected
to
the
requirement
in
the
1986
standard
that
showers
be
located
contiguous
to
the
work
area
.
they
said
that
this
was
not
a
part
of
the
general
industry
standard
and
that
they
wished
to
continue
to
provide
showers
in
fixed
facilities
on
shore
;
that
although
contiguous
showers
may
not
be
technologically
infeasible
,
it
was
impractical
.
they
further
stated
that
change
rooms
required
under
the
general
industry
asbestos
standard
cannot
be
provided
on
ships
and
that
the
worker
must
be
allowed
to
remove
contaminated
clothing
in
an
equipment
room
as
in
the
construction
standard
(
ex
.
777
.
the
committee
suggested
several
specific
steps
to
the
decontamination
process
required
of
workers
following
work
in
a
shipboard
asbestos
activity
.
according
to
these
recommendations
,
the
employer
shall
ensure
that
employees
who
work
within
regulated
area
exit
as
follows
:
remove
asbestos
from
their
protective
clothing
using
a
hepa
vacuum
as
they
move
into
the
equipment
room
;
enter
the
equipment
room
and
remove
their
decontaminated
outer
layer
of
protective
clothing
and
place
them
in
the
receptacles
provided
for
that
purpose
;
enter
the
decontamination
room
and
perform
personal
hepa
vacuuming
;
remove
respirator
after
exiting
decontamination
room
;
wash
their
face
and
hands
prior
to
eating
or
drinking
;
if
they
are
not
going
to
make
another
entry
into
the
regulated
area
that
day
,
proceed
to
the
shower
area
and
change
room
;
and
,
don
street
clothing
(
ex
.
777
.
osha
believes
these
are
reasonable
suggestions
.
the
final
standard
permits
this
approach
based
on
the
flexibility
permitted
by
the
language
.
those
who
shower
at
remote
facilities
are
required
to
decontaminate
their
protective
clothing
prior
to
proceeding
to
the
remote
showers
.
the
committee
also
recommended
that
,
for
the
sake
of
modesty
,
the
worker
must
be
allowed
to
continue
to
wear
the
underwear
which
he
had
worn
under
his
protective
clothing
during
the
process
of
decontaminating
his
clothingremoving
them
when
entering
the
shower
.
the
1986
standards
are
silent
on
this
point
and
it
seems
reasonable
that
persons
would
be
allowed
to
continue
to
wear
his
her
underwear
during
hepa
vacuuming
and
removal
of
protective
clothing
.
