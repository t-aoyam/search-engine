supplementary
information
:
the
environmental
assessment
of
this
federally

action
indicates
that
the
project
will
not
cause
significant
local
,
regional
,

,
has
determined
that
the
preparation
and
review
of
an
environmental
impact
statement
are
not
needed
for
this
project
.
a
decline
of
salmonids
(
salmon
and
steelhead
)
is
occurring
in
the
watershed
due
in
part
to
low
water
flow
,
high
temperature
,
poor
water
quality
due
to
high
water
temperatures
,
and
a
loss
of
habitat
.
loss
of
riparian
vegetation
from
grazing
and
clearing
has
reduced
stream
shade
.
the
plan
involves
land
treatment
measures
and
technical
assistance
to
enhance
the
water
quantity
and
quality
in
the
hayfork
creek
watershed
for
restoration
of
the
anadromous
fisheries
.
this
will
be
accomplished
through
(
1
)
landowner
education
and
assistance

improving
water

benefit
surface
flows
and
aquatic
habitat
and
fisheries
,
and
(

will
be
carried
out
in
cooperation
with
the
south

on
the
development
of
practices
of
irrigation
water
management
