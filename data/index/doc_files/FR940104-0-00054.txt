along
with
this
option
,
various
testing
and
recordkeeping
requirements
were
proposed
.

demonstrate

proposed
formulation
testing
requirements
for
all
surface
protection
plants
.
all
owner
operators
of
wood
surface
protection
plants
would
be
required
to
test
their
formulation
to
determine
the
concentration
of
pentachlorophenate
if
the
owner
operators
wanted
to
avoid
generating
f033
wastes
.
if
the
analysis
showed
a
concentration
at
or
below
01
ppm
,
the
owner
operator
would
be
required
to
sign
a
certification
to
that
effect
and
maintain
records
on
site
related
to
the
testing
procedure
.
this
testing
proposed
an
analysis
using
a
method
listed
within
the
epas
test
methods
for
evaluating
solid
waste
,
physical
chemical
methods
(

.
the
agency
proposed
to
add
method
4010
to
sw846
.
method
4010
is
an
immunoassay
test
for
the
presence
of
pentachlorophenol
,
which
determines
whether
a
sample
is
above
or
below
a
set
limit
(
such
as
the
01
ppm
concentration
level
proposed
.
under
the
proposal
,
if
analysis
showed
that
a
facilitys
formulation
contains
pentachlorophenate
at
levels
exceeding
01
ppm
,
then
the
wastes
generated
from
surface
protection
at
that
facility
would
be
f033
wastes
and
the
owner
operator
would
be
subject
to
additional
operating
requirements
proposed
as
subpart
t
of
parts
264
and
265
.
for
details
on
the
specific
operating
requirements
,
the
reader
should
refer
to
the
proposed
notice
(

.
a
number
of
the
constituents
of
concern
that
are
present
in
wastes
generated
from
wood
surface
protection
processes
which
use
chlorophenolic
formulations
do
not
appear
on
the
list
of
hazardous
constituents
at
40
cfr
part
261
,
appendix
viii
.
the
agency
proposed
to
add
six
hazardous
constituents
to
appendix
viii
:
sodium
pentachlorophenate
,
potassium
pentachlorophenate
,
the
sodium
salt
of
2346tetrachlorophenol
tetrachlorophenol
,
the
potassium
salt
of
2346tetrachlorophenol
tetrachlorophenol
,
octachlorodibenzopdioxin
octachlorodibenzo
p
dioxin
(
ocdd
)
and
octachlorodibenzofuran
(
ocdf
.
sodium
and
potassium
pentachlorophenate
are
the
sodium
and
potassium
salts
of
pentachlorophenol
.
these
salts
were
proposed
for
addition
to
appendix
viii
of
40
cfr
part
261
since
,
as
a
result
of
gastric
secretions
following
ingestion
,
the
sodium
and
potassium
salts
of
pentachlorophenol
and
2346tetrachlorophenol
tetrachlorophenol
are
readily
converted
to
the
corresponding
phenols
by
acidification
.
therefore
,
the
sodium
and
potassium
salts
are
reasonably
expected
to
elicit
the
same
health
effects
as
the
corresponding
phenols
.
for
this
reason
,
the
agency
proposed
to
add
these
four
compounds
to
the
list
of
hazardous
constituents
in
appendix
viii
of
40
cfr
part
261
.
the
agency
also
requested
comment
on
an
option
not
to
list
as
hazardous
wastes
generated
from
surface
protection
processes
.
the
agency
included
the
socalled
so
called
`
nolist
no
list
'
option
in
the
proposal
because
the
future
generation
of
chlorophenolic
wastes
is
expected
to
diminish
rapidly
to
zero
and
because
the
results
of
risk
analyses
show
that
the
risks
from
the
dominant
exposure
pathways
are
relatively
modest
,
assuming
the
widespread
use
of
chlorophenolic
formulations
does
not
resume
.
the
agency
believed
at
the
time
of
the
proposal
that
reintroduction
of
chlorophenolic
formulations
into
the
market
place
in
the
future
was
not
likely
to
occur
.
epa
also
noted
that
the
agency
would
always
have
the
option
of
reconsidering
the
listing
determination
should
chlorophenolic
surface
protection
formulations
be
reintroduced
in
the
future
.
