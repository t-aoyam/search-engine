reflected
the

and
the
virtual
absence

protection
.
these
baseline
exposures
were
reported
by
osha
in
its
1986
ria
and
served
to
establish
baseline
risk
estimates
for
affected
workers
prior
to
compliance
with
the
final
standard
promulgated
in
1986
.
in
its
1986
ria
,
osha
assumed
that
the
controls
implied
by

with
the
1986
standard
would
result
in
specified
rates
of
effectiveness
and
would
lead
to

in

.
in
this
final
ria
for
the
revised
asbestos
standard
,
osha
developed
an
exposure
profile
for
affected
occupational
groups
using
representative
data
from
the
1986
ria
,
from
consad
reports
[
1985
,
1990
]
and
from
the
rulemaking
record
.
for
each
affected
sector
,
osha
estimated
baseline
exposures
using
the
following
assumptions
:
(

)
where
reasonable
and
appropriate
,
engineering
controls
and
work
practices
assigned
in
the

were
assumed
to
be
in

use
;
(

where
engineering
controls
and
work
practices
were
not
sufficient
to
reduce
maximum
exposures
to

an
