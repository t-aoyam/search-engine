these

the

beneficial
to
the

in
that
its

section
112f
)
of
the
clean
air
act
specifies
that
additional
standards
may
be
required
for
a
source
category
even
after
a
mact
standard
is
promulgated
.
in
particular
,
under
section
112f
,
epa
is
required
to
promulgate
an
additional
emission
standard
for
a
source
category
within
8
years
after
promulgation
of
the
mact
standard
depending
on
the
risk
remaining
to
the
most
exposed
individual
or
to
prevent
an
adverse
environmental
effect
.
an
additional
standard
would
be
required
if
the
mact
standard
for
a
source
category
that
emits
a
pollutant
classified
as
a

,
probable
,

because
the

of
the

deals
with
the
volatile
hap
which
likely
cause
such
a
risk
or
other
adverse
environmental
effects
upfront
and
in
the
mact
standard
,
it
provides
a
possibility
that
the

would
not
be
subject

cleaning

include
cleaning
of

,
lines
conveying

,

and

from

to
the
spray

,
and

.
in
evaluating
work
practices
that
could
be
implemented
to
reduce
emissions
from
cleaning
and
washoff
operations
,
the
committee
considered
work
practices
already
in
use
by
some
facilities
in
the
source
category
.
in
addition
,
the
work
practice
work
group
explored
options
used
by
other
industries
,
in
particular
,
the
use
of
alternate
cleaning
materials
with
lower
vapor
pressure
or
hap
content
.
this
option
was
rejected
because
it
limited
the

ability
to
reuse
the
cleaning
materials
elsewhere
,
such
as
for

materials
.
