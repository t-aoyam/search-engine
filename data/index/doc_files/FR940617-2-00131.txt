we
agree
with
the
comment
regarding
the
difficulty
of
basing
a
state
allocation
formula
on
anticipated
arrivals
and
have
dropped
this
factor
from
the
formula
.
in
the
interest
of
consistency
,
we
have
changed
the
notice
to
require
states
to
allocate
fpp
funds
using
a
formula
which
reflects
arrivals
during
fy
1993
to
local
jurisdictions
,
the
same
formula
used
by
orr
to
allocate
fpp
funds
to
states
.
we
have
no
specific
guidance
regarding
the
distribution
of
administrative
costs
between
county
and
state
;
this
is
an
issue
that
should
be
resolved
between
the
county
and
the
state
.
all
costs
claimed
against
grants
must
be
in
conformity
with
hhs
grants
regulations
at
45
cfr
part
92
and
other
applicable
federal
requirements
.
in
regard
to
performance
requirements
for
the
fpp
program
,
we
have
not
added
any
new
reporting
requirements
.
as
in
fy
1993
,
states
are
required
to
provide
program
performance
information
on
the
fpp
program
consistent
with
the
reporting
requirements
contained
in
45
cfr
92
40
,
under
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
social
services
grant
awards
to
states
.
in
addition
,
we
have
simply
clarified
that
the
information
to
be
reported
must
include
the
four
items
listed
in
this
notice
.
regarding
program
outcomes
,
states
may
provide
available
outcome
data
from
individual
contracts
.
in
regard
to
suggestions
for
additional
requirements
for
fpp
projects
,
we
have
decided
not
to
consider
additional
requirements
since
this
is
the
last
year
of
the
fpp
setaside
set
aside
program
.
comment
:
five
commenters
addressed
the
issue
of
orrs
use
of
15
%
of
social
service
funds
for
orr
discretionary
grants
.
two
commenters
indicated
support
for
the
15
%
discretionary
use
,
while
two
commenters
objected
it
.
one
commenter
recommended
that
there
should
be
equitable
distribution
of
discretionary
funding
with
input
and
involvement
of
states
,
an
expansion
of
selection
panels
,
more
lead
time
to
develop
proposals
,
and
the
development
of
meaningful
evaluation
criteria
.
another
commenter
felt
that
the
notice
should
describe
the
focus
of
discretionary
funds
for
fy
1994
,
as
has
been
done
in
previous
years
.
response
:
we
continue
to
believe
that
it
is
necessary
to
maintain
a
portion
of
social
service
funds
for
discretionary
use
in
order
to
carry
out
national
initiatives
and
special
projects
that
respond
to
changing
needs
and
circumstances
in
the
refugee
program
.
regarding
the
issue
of
equitable
distribution
,
discretionary
funds
are
awarded
on
a
competitive
basis
,
based
on
the
quality
of
applications
in
relation
to
the
evaluation
criteria
,
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
a
populationbased
population
based
allocation
formula
.
therefore
,
the
geographic
distribution
of
funds
awarded
on
the
basis
of
merit
may
not
be
the
same
as
a
distribution
by
formula
.
regarding
more
state
involvement
in
discretionary
funding
,
since
states
are
frequently
competitors
for
orr
discretionary
funds
,
along
with
other
applicants
,
it
is
not
possible
to
involve
states
in
funding
decisions
without
creating
a
conflict
of
interest
,
a
violation
of
federal
grant
rules
.
we
do
not
believe
our
selection
panels
need
to
be
expanded
;
orr
selection
panels
have
traditionally
been
broadbased
broad
based
,
involving
a
varied
group
of
experts
from
the
resettlement
field
and
other
disciplines
.
we
agree
that
sufficient
lead
time
is
necessary
to
develop
proposals
;
we
are
committed
to
allowing
as
much
lead
time
as
the
grant
process
timetable
will
bear
.
we
also
agree
that
the
use
of
meaningful
evaluation
criteria
is
essential
in
the
review
of
grant
applications
;
such
evaluation
criteria
are
included
in
our
grant
announcements
.
we
have
not
included
a
description
of
our
discretionary
focus
for
fy
1994
because
we
have
been
in
the
process
of
revamping
our
discretionary
program
agenda
this
year
.
fy
1994
grant
announcements
have
recently
been
made
available
in
the
federal
register
.

comment
:
three
commenters
expressed
support
for
the
concurrent
provision
of
english
language
training
with
employment
and
employmentrelated
employment
related
services
.
one
commenter
recommended
that
the
provision
of
english
language
training
be
tied
to
the
provision
of
vocational
training
and
that
the
notice
reflect
this
emphasis
.
response
:
we
do
not
believe
that
english
language
training
should
be
tied
exclusively
to
one
type
of
employmentrelated
employment
related
service
such
as
vocational
training
.
our
intent
is
to
encourage
the
concurrent
provision
of
english
language
training
in
concert
with
other
employmentrelated
employment
related
services
to
speed
the
process
of
a
refugee
becoming
employed
and
selfsufficient
self
sufficient
.
at
the
same
time
,
we
want
to
discourage
the
provision
of
english
language
training
in
a
sequential
manner
,
as
a
prerequisite
to
receiving
other
employmentrelated
employment
related
services
.
