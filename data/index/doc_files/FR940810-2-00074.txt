this
notice
sets
forth
amended
processing
instructions
for
title
ii
and
title
vi
.
title
ii
has
over
4
years
of
operating
experience
and
title
vi
has
over
a
year
and
a
half
of
operating
experience
.
during
this
time
,
we
have
received
numerous
suggestions
and
comments
from
the
field
as
well
as
the
industry
regarding
program
changes
.
after
reviewing
these
suggestions
and
comments
,
we
have
determined
that
a
number
of
policies
and
instructions
set
forth
in
the
current
notices
and
hud
handbook
43506
should
be
revised
to
speed
the
delivery
of
the
programs
and
better
serve
our
clientele
.
in
preparing
these
instructions
,
we
were
aware
of
the
problems
some
offices
were
experiencing
coordinating
the
different
review
functions
,
which
has
in
some
cases
made
the
program
more
difficult
to
administer
.
we
have
assembled
a
combined
housing
managementhousing
management
housing
development
preservation
unit
to
work
exclusively
on
this
program
.
this
unit
has
proven
beneficial
in
understanding
and
providing
solutions
to
the
different
review
functions
.
this
notice
contains
instructions
for
both
the
production
and
asset
management
branches
.
it
is
hoped
that
combining
these
instructions
will
eliminate
some
of
the
coordination
problems
,
provide
additional
processing
tools
and
the
administrative
flexibility
needed
to
better
administer
the
program
.

the

replaces

,
the

the

may
,
at
its
option
,
request
that
it

it
should
include

.
all
reasonable
