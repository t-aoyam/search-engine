upon
reviewing
and
responding
to
comments
received
on
the
proposed
rule
,
the
agency
has
decided
not
to
list
as
hazardous
wastes
from
the
use
of
chlorophenolic
formulations
in
the
wood
surface
protection
industry
for
several
reasons
.
first
,
chlorophenolic
formulations
are
no
longer
being
produced
in
the
united
states
and
the
agency
believes
it
is
very
unlikely
they
will
be
produced
in
the
future
.
the
only
remaining
producer
of
chlorophenolics
in
the
us
,
chapman
chemicals
,
stopped
production
in
january
of
1992
and
sometime
later
applied
for
voluntary
cancellation
of
its
fifra
product
registration
.
a
notice
describing
this
action
was
published
in
the
federal
register
on
06/03/1992
(
57
fr
23401
,
and
a
final
cancellation
order
was
sent
to
chapman
chemicals
with
an
effective
date
of
09/14/1992
.
this
cancellation
notice
applies
to
the
following
products
produced
by
chapman
chemicals
:
permatox

,
10s
,
and

,

any
manufacturer
wishing
to
resume
production
of
chlorophenolics
would
have
to
obtain
a
new
fifra
registration
before
these
chemicals
could
be
reintroduced
introduced
and
made
available
for
use
in
wood
surface
protection
.
currently
,
there
remains
only
one
known
user
of
chlorophenolics
in
the
us
.
out
of
an
estimated
1000
previous
users
and
the
remaining
plants
existing
stock
is
believed
to
be
very
limited
.
a
major
element
in
the
decision
not
to
list
as
hazardous
chlorophenolic
wastes
generated
from
the
surface
protection
industry
is
the
fact
that
use
of
chlorophenolic
formulations
has
ceased
.
epa
believes
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
a
manufacturer
will
seek
reregistration
for
this
product
for
many
reasons
,
including
the
availability
of
effective
substitute
products
and
the
potentially
high
financial
and
administrative
burdens
imposed
by
the
fifra
registration
process
.
additional
justification
to
support
nonfuture
future
production
is
the
fact
that
european
countries
do
not
want
to
accept
dioxincontaining
dioxin
containing
wood
products
which
have
affected
large
export
mills
who
will
not
use
chlorophenolic
formulations
in
the
future
in
part
for
this
reason
.
use
of
chlorophenolics
for
surface
protection
has
declined
steadily
(
even
without
the
influence
of
rcra
)
from
over
1000
users
to
one
user
over
the
past
decade
.
should
a
new
registration
of
this
product
be
sought
,
epa
will
consider
this
surface
protection
risk
analysis
for
full
strength
application
when
determining
whether
a
new
listing
determination
under
rcra
should
be
initiated
.
currently
,
the
agency
is
aware
of
nine
available
substitute
products
currently
being
used
by
surface
protectors
in
place
of
chlorophenolics
.
the
substitute
products
are
for
a
large
part
satisfactory
to
their
users
(
as
mentioned
on
various
site
trips
,
and
the
agency
does
not
feel
as
though
a
switch
back
to
chlorophenolics
is
likely
.
a
second
reason
why
the
agency
has
decided
not
to
list
these
wastes
is
because
the
risk
to
human
health
and
the
environment
from
ongoing
on
going
operations
which
previously
used
chlorophenolics
is
shown
to
tail
off
quickly
because
chlorophenolic
concentrations
diminish
to
a
near
zero
concentration
within
a
short
period
of
time
following
switchover
to
an
alternate
product
.
the
agency
has
determined
that
the
use
of
fullstrength
full
strength
chlorophenolic
formulations
generates
wastes
that
result
in
unacceptable
risk
to
human
health
and
the
environment
.
as
before
mentioned
,
should
the
use
of
chlorophenolics
for
surface
protection
applications
resume
,
for
any
reason
,
the
agency
will
most
likely
reevaluate
evaluate
its
current
position
.
however
,
dealing
with
the
current
situation
,
there
remains
only
one
known
user
of
chlorophenolics
with
a
limited
supply
remaining
.
although
the
agency
believes
the
use
of
fullstrength
full
strength
chlorophenolics
will
be
phased
out
in
the
very
near
future
,
there
was
concern
at
the
time
of
proposal
that
there
may
be
unacceptable
risks
posed
by
the
use
of
substitute
products
that
become
crosscontaminated
cross
contaminated
from
previous
chlorophenolic
use
.
particularly
,
the
proposal
cited
possible
ground
water
risks
of

for
individuals
and
a
broad
but
very
low
potential
exposure
risk
due
to
surface
runoff
run
off
contributing
to
dioxin
levels
in
fish
.
the
agency
received
several
comments
addressing
these
potential
impacts
.
in
response
to
these
comments
,
the
agency
conducted
additional
groundwater
ground
water
modeling
using
new
pulse
assumptions
developed
from
commentersubmitted
commenter
submitted
information
.
the
agency
developed
what
it
believed
to
be
better
pulse
assumptions
in
an
effort
to
determine
how
long
pentachlorophenate
will
be
present
in
ongoing
on
going
operations
which
have
switched
over
from
its
past
use
.
this
new
data
was
obtained
from
performing
mass
balance
iterations
using
typical
tank
volumes
found
at
both
large
and
small
facilities
.
these
mathematical
calculations
showed
that
crosscontamination
cross
contamination
from
previous
use
of
chlorophenolics
will
be
present
in
a
substitute
products
for
only
two
to
six
years
from
the
time
a
plant
stops
using
chlorophenolics
.
the
agency
found
that
the
highest
estimated
risk
to
an
individual
from
drinking
ground
water
for
nine
years
at
peak
concentrations
in
the
two
-
or
sixyear
six
year
pulse
resulting
from
cross
contamination
,
is
significantly
diminished
and
the
broad
effect
on
dioxin
levels
in
fish
is
reduced
by
several
orders
of
magnitude
.
this
new
analysis
shows
that
the
risks
associated
with
crosscontamination
cross
contamination
do
not
justify
a
hazardous
waste
listing
to
capture
crosscontaminated
cross
contaminated
wastes
.
in
the
proposed
rule
,
epa
addressed
the
fact
that
pcp
is
no
longer
in
use
at
most
facilities
in
its
baseline
risk
estimates
,
which
have
been
revised
in
the
final
rule
to
reflect
source
concentrations
and
pulse
durations

of
the
