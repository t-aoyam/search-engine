informal
actions

the
partners

provide
the
marketing
affiliates
with
significant
advantages
,
such
as
nonpublic
public
transportation
information
.
for
example
,
if
ozark
intends
to
build
a
new
pipeline
under
part
284
of
the
commissions
regulations
,
the
partners
could
convey
that
information
to
their
marketing
affiliates
,
and
the
marketing
affiliates
would
have
an
advantage
over
nonaffiliated
marketers
in
obtaining
customers
.
likewise
,
information
with
respect
to
the
addition
of

could
be
of
significant
advantage
to

ozark
also
states
that
it
has
not
discriminated
in
the
past
and
that
no
ozark
partner
has
vetoed
any
transportation
transactions
.
ozark
asserts
that
its

structure
together
with
its

should
serve
to
successfully
rebut
a
presumption
of
control
.
but
the
partners

to
control
the
management
and

of
the

is
not
linked
to
whether
ozark
has
discriminated

past
.

the

finally
,
ozark
argues
that

provisions
of

4
of

and
therefore
will
not

that

for
acting
on
§

)
and
284

)
filings
are
illegal
.
hadson
states
that
the
commission
treats
these
filings
as
nontariff
tariff
filings
which
are
assigned
an
mg

prefix
.
hadson
states
that
according
to
§
1613j
)
the
filings
are
made
to
enable
shippers
and
the
commission
to
determine
how
the
pipeline
is
complying
with
the
substantive
standards
of
conduct
.
hadson
submits
that
the
filings
cannot
achieve
this
purpose
,
however
,
since
they
are
withheld
from
public
notice
in
the
federal
register
and
in
the
commissions
daily
orders
.
hadson
contends
that
they
are
effectively
concealed
from
public
view
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
since
shippers
and
other
interested
members
of
the
public
have
no
way
of
knowing
when
to
look
to
find
a
new
or
revised
mg
filing
.
hadson
states
that
,
moreover
,
the
commission
has
ruled
that
the
mg
filings
are
nonadversarial
adversarial
and
that
the
commission
may
therefore
rely
upon
nonpublic
public
and
offtherecord
off
the
record
communications
in
determining
whether
a
pipeline
is
in
compliance
with
the
substantive
standards
or
not
.
31
hadson
states
that
the
commission
has
further
ruled
that
no
one
may
protest
or
intervene
in
the
nonpublic
public
proceedings
.
hadson
states
that
any
attempt
to
assert
that
a
compliance
filing
is
not
in
compliance
with
the
law
will
be
redocketed
in
a
new
proceeding
and
treated
as
a
complaint
in
which
the
erstwhile
protestant
bears
the
burden
of
conducting
discovery
to
prove
that
a
pipelines
compliance
filing
is
not
in
compliance
with
the
law
,
rather
than
the
pipeline
being
responsible
for
showing
compliance

hadson
argues
that
similar

the

636
appears
to
generally
incorporate

procedures
and
relies
upon
them
to
support
the
effective
deregulation
of

.
hadson
states
that
the
basis
for
this
conclusion
is
that
order
no
.
636
appears
to
maintain
the
dichotomy
between
tariff
provisions
(
which
presumably
would
be
made
in
an
mt
or
successor
docket
)
and
procedures
(
which
filing
requirement
,
the
commission
states
,
would
be
similar
to
that
of
§
1613j
.
33
hadson
asserts
that
the
primary
difference
between
the
new
and
the
current
procedures
,
and
the
only
apparent
reason
for
not
incorporating
§
1613j
)
along
with
the
various
other
sections
which
were
incorporated
by
reference
,
is
that
the
new
rules
have
deleted
the
statement
that
the
filing
will
enable
shippers
and
the
commission
to
determine
how
a

is
complying
with
the

hadson
contends
that
the
deletion
of
the
phrase
is
apparently
not
accidental
since
it
accurately
reflects
the
fact
that
the
new

not

any

to

leave
the

hadson
asserts
that
the

here
is
whether

hadson
calls
the

procedures
of

for

of

for
