studies
of
cognitive
and
neuropsychiatric
disorders
are
beset
by
a
number
of
methodologic
problems
,
including
exposure
measures
,
the
wide
variety
of
`
standardized
'
test
instruments
used
,
and
the
inability
to
detect
or
correct
for
other
influences
on
test
results
such
as
emotional
state
,
nonneurologic
neurologic
disease
,
metabolic
conditions
,
fatigue
,
medications
,
or
style
of
the
examiner
.
because
of
their
failure
to
adequately
control
for
these
confounding
factors
,
these
studies
lack
credibility
in
assessing
the
relationship
of
herbicide
exposure
to
these
conditions
.
accordingly
,
the
secretary
has
found
that
there
is
no
credible
evidence
for
an
association
between
cognitive
and
neuropsychiatric
disorders
and
herbicide
exposure
,
and
he
has
determined
that
a
positive
association
does
not
exist
.
there
were
no
significant
studies
available
to
analyze
whether
an
association
exists
between
herbicide
exposure
and
motor
coordination
dysfunction
.
accordingly

the
secretary
has
found
that
there
is
no
credible
evidence
for
an
association
between
motor
coordination
dysfunction
and
herbicide
exposure
,
and
he

.
metabolic
and
digestive
disorders
(
diabetes

,
hepatic
enzyme
abnormality
,
lipid

and
ulcers
)
were
also
categorized
by
nas
as
health
outcomes
with
inadequate
insufficient
evidence
to
determine
whether
an
association
exists
.
although
nas
found
no
biologic
basis
to
suspect
an
association
between
herbicide
exposure
and
diabetes
,
abnormal

have
been

while
this
suggests
such
an
association
,
the
evidence
is
inconclusive
and
its
credibility
is
questionable
because
an
abnormal
glucose

test
is
not
an
absolute
indicator
of
diabetes

none
of
