for

osha
projects
that

osha
believes
,
however
,
that

not
be

severe
as
depicted

compliance

for

were
estimated
on
a
perbuilding
per
building
basis
,
rather
than
a

due

first
,
it
appears
that
there
are
few
services
that
compete
with
floor
maintenance
directly
,
and
therefore
demand
for
services
provided
by
the
industry
is
relatively
inelastic
.
secondly
,
all
floorlaying
floor
laying
establishments
are
treated
uniformly
by
the
revised
standard
.
because
no
individual
firm
faces
unfair
regulatory
treatment
by
the
revised
standard
,
cost
impacts
are
expected
across
the
majority
of
industry
.
consequently
,
most
affected
firms
should
be
able
to
pass
forward
costs
to
customers
without
significant
redistribution
of
market
share
.
as

osha
has
concluded
that
no
differential
adverse
impact
will
be
experienced
by
small
firms
in
any
construction
sector
when
compared
to
larger
firms
because
the
costs
of
compliance
are
expected
to
be
roughly
equivalent
on
a
perworker
per
worker
basis
.
routine
maintenance
in
industrial
facilities
.
in
profiling
asbestos
maintenance
activities
within
general
industry
,
osha
and
consad
have
assumed
that
the
majority
of
the
work
would
be
performed
by
plant
and
maintenance
personnel
within
the
establishment
.
under
this
assumption
,
incremental
costs
attributed
to
requirements
in
the
revised
construction
standard
that
pertain
to
these
maintenance
tasks
would
financially
impact
general
industry
.
therefore
,
economic
impacts
associated
with
routine
maintenance
in
general
industry
are
included
in
this
section
on
impacts
under
the
construction
standard
.
