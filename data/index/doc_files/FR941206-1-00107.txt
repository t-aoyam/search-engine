coating
operations
most
hap
emissions
from
coating
operations
in
this
industry
occur
outdoors
where
the
technology
for
their
capture
has
not
been
demonstrated
.
as
a
result
the
only
available
technology
for
reducing
emissions
is
to
require
use
of
coatings
with
lower
volatile
content
.
virtually
all
of
the
hap
and
voc
contained
in
marine
coatings
are
emitted
to
the
atmosphere
during
the
course
of
application
and
drying
.
thus
,
an
emission
standard
based
on
limiting
both
hap
and
voc
content
of
the
coatings
,
as
applied
,
is
appropriate
for
these
operations
,
particularly
because
any
additional
hap
and
voc
that
may
be
formed
and
emitted
during
the
curing
process
are
detected
and
measured
by
the
reference
measurement
methodology
.
as
a
result
,
the
types
of
coatings
used
by
the
industry
were
identified
and
maximum
,
nevertobeexceeded
never
to
be
exceeded
hap
limits
were
selected
for
each
of
the
several
coating
categories
.
to
allow
additional
flexibility
,
the
ability
to
average
limits
across
categories
was
also
considered
.
under
an
averaging
approach
,
any
coating
regardless
of
volatile
organic
content
,
can
be
used
as
long
as
the
volume
weighted
average
as
applied
vohap
content
,
ie
,
as
measured
by
the
reference
method
,
of
all
coatings
does
not
exceed
the
average
calculated
from
their
individual
limits
.
in
developing
the
limits
,
the
agency
considered
two
types
of
averages
:
(
1
)
separate
averages
for
coating
within
each
of
the
coating
categories
and
(
2
)
a
single
average
for
all
coatings
used
by
a
facility
.
the
option
of
establishing
limits
based
on
weighted
averages
of
various
coatings
of
different
pollution
content
was
abandoned
when
the
industry
indicated
that
time
and
effort
to
plan
,
track
,
and
demonstrate
compliance
would
be
too
burdensome
.
as
a
result
,
the
limits
are
based
on
nevertobeexceeded
never
to
be
exceeded
vohap
contents
for
23
categories
of
coatings
and
permits

for
purposes

conditions

proposed

and
