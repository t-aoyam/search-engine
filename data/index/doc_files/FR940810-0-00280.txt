crystals
which
have
different
crystal
regularity
in
two
or
three
main
directions
are
said
to
be
anisotropic
.
they
have
a
different
index
of
refraction
in
each
of
the
main
directions
.
when
such
a
crystal
is
inserted
between
the
crossed
polars
,
the
field
of
view
is
no
longer
dark
but
shows
the
crystal
in
color
.
the
color
depends
on
the
properties
of
the
crystal
.
the
light
acts
as
if
it
travels
through
the
crystal
along
the
optical
axes
.
if
a
crystal
optical
axis
were
lined
up
along
one
of
the
polarizing
directions
(
either
the
polarizer
or
the
analyzer
)
the
light
would
appear
to
travel
only
in
that
direction
,
and
it
would
blink
out
or
go
dark
.
the
difference
in
degrees
between
the
fiber
direction
and
the
angle
at
which
it
blinks
out
is
called
the
angle
of
extinction
.
when
this
angle
can
be
measured
,
it
is
useful
in
identifying
the
mineral
.
the
procedure
for
measuring
the
angle
of
extinction
is
to
first
identify
the
polarization
direction
in
the
microscope
.
a
commercial
alignment
slide
can
be
used
to
establish
the
polarization
directions
or
use
anthophyllite
or
another
suitable
mineral
.
this
mineral
has
a
zero
degree
angle
of
extinction
and
will
go
dark
to
extinction
as
it
aligns
with
the
polarization
directions
.
when
a
fiber
of
anthophyllite
has
gone
to
extinction
,
align
the
eyepiece
reticle
or
graticule
with
the
fiber
so
that
there
is
a
visual
cue
as
to
the
direction
of
polarization
in
the
field
of
view
.
tape
or
otherwise
secure
the
eyepiece
in
this
position
so
it
will
not
shift
.
after
the
polarization
direction
has
been
identified
in
the
field
of
view
,
move
the
particle
of
interest
to
the
center
of
the
field
of
view
and
align
it
with
the
polarization
direction
.
for
fibers
,
align
the
fiber
along
this
direction
.
note
the
angular
reading
of
the
rotating
stage
.
looking
at
the
particle
,
rotate
the
stage
until
the
fiber
goes
dark
or
`
blinks
out
.
again
note
the
reading
of
the
stage
.
the
difference
in
the
first
reading
and
the
second
is
an
angle
of
extinction
.
the
angle
measured
may
vary
as
the
orientation
of
the
fiber
changes
about
its
long
axis
.
tables
of
mineralogical
data
usually
report
the
maximum
angle
of
extinction
.
asbestos
forming
minerals
,
when
they
exhibit
an
angle
of
extinction
,
usually
do
show
an
angle
of
extinction
close
to
the
reported
maximum
,
or
as
appropriate
depending
on
the
substitution
chemistry
.

crossed

when
the
optical
axes
of
a
crystal
are
not
lined
up
along
one
of
the
polarizing
directions
(
either
the
polarizer
or
the
analyzer
)
part
of
the
light
travels
along
one
axis
and
part
travels
along
the
other
visible
axis
.
this
is
characteristic
of
birefringent
materials
.
the
color
depends
on
the
difference
of
the
two
visible
indices
of
refraction
and
the
thickness
of
the
crystal
.
the
maximum
difference
available
is
the
difference
between
the
and
the
axes
.
this
maximum
difference
is
usually
tabulated
as
the
birefringence
of
the
crystal
.
