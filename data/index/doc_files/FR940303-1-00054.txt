its

fsiss
tentative

intended
to
provide
a
mechanism
for
assuring
that
boneless

products
with
06
percent

is
not
an
ingredient
in
products
marketed
as
classes

address

content
(
eg
,
boneless

breasts
,
as
well
as
where
they
do
.
fsis
does
not

adopting
any
restrictions
on
the
amount
of

products
with
06
percent

that
can
be
used
in
poultry

,

products
,
in
which
it
is
a

however
,
standards
for
particular
products
may
contain
quantitative
limits
(
eg
,
the
limit
on
the
amount
of

product
ingredients
permitted
in
cooked

such
as
frankfurters
and

(

tentative
position
:
finished
poultry
products
and
meat
food
products
.
as
indicated
previously
,
fsis
is
considering
proposing
that
boneless
poultry
product
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
should
be
classified
as
`
poultry
'
or
`
poultry
meat
'
and
that
it
should
be
described
accordingly
.
although
boneless
poultry
product
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
is
finely
ground
in
form
,
it
is
expected
that
this
product
would
be
used
as
an
ingredient
in
products
which
are
,
themselves
,
categorized
as
finely
ground
in
texture
,
eg
,
frankfurters
and
bologna
.
therefore
,
fsis
is
considering
that
when
boneless
poultry
product
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
is
used
as
ingredient
in
a
poultry
or
meat
product
,
it
should
be
declared
by
terms
that
accurately
describe
it
as
a
poultry
or
poultry
meat
product
,
eg
,
`
chicken
'
and
`
turkey
meat
'
fsiss
tentative
position
is
not
to
require
special
declaration
of
calcium
and
or
cholesterol
content
on
labeling
of
a
poultry
or
meat
food
product
containing
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
because
calcium
and
cholesterol
declaration
becomes
necessary
on
the
labeling
of
most
multiingredient
ingredient
poultry
and
meat
products
upon
the
effective
date
of
fsiss
nutrition
labeling
regulations
(
58
fr
632
.
fsiss
tentative
labeling
provisions
reflect
fsiss
belief
that
nutrition
labeling
is
the
most
appropriate
place
for
calcium
and
cholesterol
content
information
by
requiring
that
the
declaration
of
calcium
and
or
cholesterol
content
appear
as
part
of
any
nutrition
labeling
that
a
poultry
product
or
meat
food
product
bears
