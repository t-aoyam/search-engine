is
amending
the

fda
also
is
retaining
the
existing

this
final
rule
will
ensure
both
that
the
minimum
quality
of

and
that
bottled

in
the

of
06/07/1991
(

,
epa
published
a
final
rule
promulgating
npdwrs
that
established
corrosion
control
treatment
technique
requirements
for
controlling
lead
and
copper
levels
in
public

systems
when
these
contaminants
exceed
levels
of

mg
l
for
lead
and
13
mg
l
for
copper
in
more
than
10
percent
of
targeted
tap
samples
.
targeted
tap
water
samples
represent
samples
collected
from
residences
most
likely
to
have
lead
problems
as
a
result
of
corrosion
in
the
distribution
systems
.
epa
established
treatment
technique
requirements
rather
than
maximum
contaminant
levels
(
mcls
)
for
lead
and
copper
in
drinking
water
because
it
believed
that
treatment
technique
requirements
are
more
appropriate
to
control
contamination
of
lead
and
copper
that
is
largely
the
result
of
circumstances
beyond
the
direct
control
of
public
water
systems
(
ie
,
corrosion
in
service
lines
not
owned
by
the
systems
and
in
the
plumbing
of
residences
and
buildings
.
in
addition
,
epa
established
maximum
contaminant
level
goals
(
mclgs
)
of
zero
for
lead
and
13
mg
l
for
copper
which
are
based
solely
on
considerations
of
protecting
the
public
from
the
adverse
health
effects
of
these
contaminants
in
drinking
water
.
in
accordance
with
section
410
of
the
act
,
fda
published
in
the
federal
register
of
01/05/1993
(
58
fr

,
a
proposal
to
amend
the
quality
standard
for
bottled
water
to
establish
an
allowable
level
of
0
005
mg
l
for
lead
and
to
retain
the
existing
allowable
level
of
1
mg
l
for
copper
.
fda
proposed
a
lower
level
of
0
005
mg
l
for
lead
in
bottled
water
than
epas
level
of
0
015
mg
l
for
lead
in
drinking
water
that
triggers
treatment
technique
requirements
.
fdas
data
showed
that
most
bottlers
do
not
normally
experience
the
significant
lead
contamination
problems
from
corrosion
of
materials
that
are
presented
by
public
water
distribution
systems
and
residential
plumbing
(
eg
,
pipes
,
faucets
,
and
solder
,
and
that
bottlers
can
produce
bottled
water
products
with
lead
levels
below
0
005
mg
l
.
furthermore
,
this
level
represents
the
lowest
level
at
which
fda
can
take
enforcement
action
because
it
corresponds
to
the
practical
quantitation
limit
(
pql
)
of
the
best
available
analytical
methods
for
determining
lead
levels
in
water
.
finally
,
fda
noted
that
establishing
the
allowable
level
for
lead
at
0
005
mg
l
would
provide
public
health
protection
at
least
equivalent
to
that
provided
by
epas
npdwr
and
would
ensure
that
bottled
water
products
are
free
of
significant
lead
contamination
.
with
respect
to
the
allowable
level
for
copper
,
the
existing
allowable
level
of
1
mg
l
in
bottled
water
is
below
epas
mclg
of
13
mg
l
and
is
equivalent
to
epas
secondary
maximum
contaminant
level
(
smcl
,
which
is
based
on
the
aesthetic
effects
of
copper
in
drinking
water
.
thus
,
fda
proposed
to
retain
the
existing
allowable
level
to
ensure
that
levels
of
copper
in
bottled
water
meet
the
safety
and
aesthetic
criteria
that
epa
has
established
for
copper
in
drinking
water
.

the

response
to
comments

.
most
comments
supported
the
proposed
allowable
levels
of
0
005
mg
l
for
lead
and
1
mg
l
for
copper
in
the
quality
standard
for
bottled
water
.
one
comment
,
however
,
stated
that
the
allowable
level
for
lead
in
bottled
water
should
not
be
any
lower
than
epas
corrosion
treatment
trigger
level
of
0
015
mg
l
for
lead
in
drinking
water
because
this
level
corresponds
to
an
average
lead
level
of
0
005
mg
l
,
the
level
which
most
bottled
waters
do
not
exceed
.
the
comment
argued
that
the
fact
that
0
005
mg
l
is
at
the
lower
limit
of
reliable
measurement
for
lead
does
not
justify
setting
a
standard
at
that
level
.
the
comment
further
argued
that
setting
a
standard
for
lead
in
bottled
water
is
not
necessary
because
lead
content
is
not
a
problem
in
bottled
water
.
the
comment
maintained
that
imposing
regulations
for
the
sake
of
regulation
is
a
problem
because
of
the
high
costs
incurred
by
diverting
fda
resources
from
significant
regulatory
concerns
.
fda
disagrees
with
this
comment
.
under
section
410
of
the
act
,
fdas
approach
has
been
to
respond
to
epas
promulgation
of
drinking
water
regulations
under
the
sdwa
by
amending
the
quality
standard
for
bottled
water
to
maintain
compatibility
with
epas
regulations
.
fda
concludes
that
amending
the
standard
for
lead
in
bottled
water
to
0
005
mg
l
is
fully
compatible
and
consistent
with
the
epa
standard
.
based
on
the
available
health
effects
information
,
epa
established
an
mclg
of
zero
for
lead
in
drinking
water
.
by
adopting
this
mclg
,
epa
was
in
effect
saying
that
if
zero
lead
in
drinking
water
can
be
achieved
,
it
should
be
achieved
.
however
,
epa
concluded
that
zero
lead
in
public
drinking
water
could
not
be
achieved
because
of
contamination
of
the
water
with
lead
from
corrosion
of
leadcontaining
lead
containing
materials
in
public
water
distribution
systems
and
in
residential
plumbing
.
to
control
this
contamination
,
epa
established
treatment
technique
requirements
which
are
triggered
when
more
than
10
percent
of
the
targeted
tap
water
samples
exceeds
0
015
mg
l
for
lead
.
bottled
water
,
however
,
generally
does
not
have
significant
lead
contamination
problems
.
fda
conducted
a
survey
of
bottled
water
in
1990
(
ref
.
1
,
and
the
findings
of
that
survey
show
that
most
bottlers
are
using
source
waters
that
are
free
of
significant
lead
contamination
and
can
readily
produce
bottled
water
products
with
lead
levels
below
0
005
mg
l
,
the
pql
for
lead
in
water
.
consequently
,
because
this
level
,
which
is
as
close
to
epas
mclg
of
zero
as
possible
,
is
achievable
in
bottled
water
,
there
is
no
reason
for
fda
to
rely
on
epas
0
015
mg
l
trigger
level
in
establishing
an
allowable
level
for
lead
in
bottled
water
.
in
fact
,
in
its
review
and
comment
on
fdas
proposal
(
before
it
published
in
the
federal
register
)
,
epa
stated
that
the
regulatory
approach
taken
by
fda
to
establish
an
allowable
level
of
0
005
mg
l
for
lead
in
bottled
water
is
consistent
with
the
intent
of
the
npdwr
for
lead
in
public
drinking
water
(

.
one
comment
asserted
that
there
is
no
safe
threshold
for
lead
in
drinking
water
and
,
because
technological
resources
and
knowledge
make
it
feasible
to
measure
lead
in
water
at
the
0
002
mg
l
level
,
fda
should
establish
the
allowable
level
for
lead
in
bottled
water
at
that
level
.
the
comment
contended
that
,
because
large
water
companies
have
been
testing
for
lead
and
reporting
lead
levels
of
0
,
0
001
,
0
002
,
0
003
,
and
0
004
mg
l
to
epa
,
the
pql
is
substantially
lower
than
0
005
mg
l
.
the
comment
stated
that
another
organization
,
which
has
limited
resources
and
is
not
in
the
business
of
supplying
water
commercially
,
uses
a
laboratory
that
has
found
the
pql
to
be
0
002
mg
l
when
testing
for
lead
in
bottled
water
.
the
comment
further
argued
that
epas
pql
concept
is
theoretically
inappropriate
for
safety
determinations
because
the
error
theory
of
laboratory
measurements
(
ie
,
the
distinction
between
the
standard
error
of
a
single
measurement
and
the
standard
error
among
a
group
of
measurements
)
upon
which
epa
bases
its
determination
of
the
pql
is
misleading
.
fda
disagrees
that
epas
pql
concept
is
inappropriate
.
epas
pql
is
set
at
the
lowest
concentration
for
a
contaminant
that
laboratories
certified
by
the
states
or
by
epa
for
water
analyses
can
reliably
measure
within
specified
limits
of
precision
and
accuracy
under
routine
laboratory
operating
conditions
.
epa
also
determines
the
pql
based
on
the
method
detection
limit
(
mdl
,
which
is
defined
as
the
lowest
concentration
of
a
substance
that
can
be
measured
with
99
percent
confidence
that
the
true
value
is
greater
than
zero
.
epa
generally
sets
the
pql
at
5
to
10
times
the
mdl
,
depending
on
the
degree
of
health
risk
posed
by
a
contaminant
(
for
contaminants
like
lead
that
pose
a
high
degree
of
health
risk
,
epa
sets
the
pql
at
5
times
the
mdl
,
and
,
if
possible
,
confirms
the
pql
by
interlaboratory
performance
evaluation
studies
.
based
on
epas
calculation
of
a
0
001
mg
l
mdl
for
lead
by
the
most
sensitive
analytical
methods
available
,
epa
set
the
pql
for
lead
at
0
005
mg
l
.
epa
confirmed
this
level
by
performance
evaluation
studies
that
evaluated
the
ability
of
epa
,
state
,
and
nonepa
epa
and
state
laboratories
to
analyze
water
samples
with
low
lead
levels

although
the
comment
stated
that
a
laboratory
used
by
another
organization
found
the
pql
to
be
0
002
mg
l
for
lead
in
bottled
water
,
it
did
not
provide
any
data
to
support
that
laboratorys
determination
.
therefore
,
this
comment
has
not
provided
an
adequate
basis
upon
which
to
call
into
question
epas
pql
.
in
summary
,
based
on
the
studies
conducted
by
epa
establishing
a
pql
of
0
005
mg
l
for
lead
in
drinking
water
,
fda
finds
that
an
allowable
level
of
0
005
mg
l
for
lead
in
the
quality
standard
for
bottled
water
is
appropriate

another
comment
stated
that
,
although
it
strongly
endorsed
the
proposed
allowable
level
for
lead
in
bottled
water
,
fda
should
review
this
standard
in
a
few
years
because
epas
1991
rule
for
lead
in
drinking
water
has
led
to
increased
analysis
for
lead
in
water
,
and
,
using
the
best
available
methodology
,
many
laboratories
can
now
routinely
measure
lead
levels
at
0
001
or
0
002
mg
l
in
water
samples
.
the
comment
maintained
that
measurement
of
lead
in
water
at
these
levels
may
soon
be
the
standard
,
`
state
of
the
art
'
technology
,
and
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
set
the
allowable
level
in
bottled
water
at
the
limit
of
detection
,
ie
,
0
005
mg
l
,
or
no
detectable
lead
,
whichever
is
less
.
fda
disagrees
that
establishing
the
allowable
level
for
lead
in

water
at
the
limit
of
detection
,
ie
,
0
005
mg

,
or
no

is
appropriate
.
as
discussed
above
,
0
005
mg
l
,
the
pql
for
lead
in

,
represents
the
lowest
concentration

can
reliably

.
fda
recognizes
that
lead
levels
in

can
be
measured
below
0

l
.
however
,
to
take
an
enforcement
action

in

,
fda
must
be
able
to

thus
,
fda
has
concluded
that
reliance
on
the
pql
as
the
allowable

fda

therefore
,
fda
agrees
with
the
comment
that
within
the
next

years
,
it
should
consult
with

about
reevaluating

moreover
,
fda
recognizes
that

fda
will
need
to
consider
whether

a
state
government
agency
and
a
majority
of
the
comments
from
industry
and
trade
associations
opposed
the
statement
in
the
proposal
that
if
the
proposal
becomes
a
final
rule
,
bottlers
will
be
required
to
test
each
lot
of
bottled
water
to
ensure
that
it
contains
less
than
0
005
mg
l
of
lead
.
the
comments
argued
that
,
because
most
bottlers
are
routinely
meeting
the
0
005
mg
l
standard
for
lead
,
a
requirement
for
testing
each
lot
of
bottled
water
for
lead
is
not
necessary
.
furthermore
,
the
majority
of
the
comments
argued
that
testing
each
lot
of
bottled
water
for
lead
would
impose
a
significant
financial
burden
on
the
bottled
water
industry
.
for
example
,
comments
from
two
trade
associations
representing
bottled
water
manufacturers
maintained
that
a
requirement
for
testing
each
lot
of
bottled
water
for
lead
would
impose
additional
annual
costs
that
they
estimated
at
$
15000
for
a
small
bottler
and
$
300000
for
a
large
bottler
.
under
the
current
good
manufacturing
practice
(
cgmp
)
regulations
for
the
processing
and
bottling
of
bottled
drinking
water
(

a
representative
sample

continuous
production

for
each
type
of
bottled

therefore
,
bottlers
will
not
be
required
to
test
each
lot
of
bottled
water
for
the
presence
of
lead
.
the
statement
that
they
would
,
which
was
inadvertently
included
in
the
economic
impact
analysis
,
was
in
error
.
however
,
fda
reminds
water
bottlers
that
each
lot
of
bottled
water
must
comply
with
the
quality
standard
for
chemical
contaminants
,
and
compliance
with
the
minimum
annual
testing
requirements
of
the
cgmp
does
not
exempt
a
firm
from

action
if
any

does
not
meet
any
provision
of
the
chemical
quality
standard

.
several
comments
recommended
that
testing
for
chemical
contaminants
(
eg
,
lead
and
copper
)
should
be
more
frequent
than
the
required
minimum
of
annual
testing
.
one
comment
noted
that
,
although
fda
has
established
quality
standards
for
bottled
water
,
it
did
not
set
any
requirements
for
monitoring
timeframes
or
submission
of
results
to
ensure
that
bottlers
meet
the
quality
standards
.
moreover
,
the
comment
objected
to
allowing
distribution
of
a
bottled
water
product
that
is
below
the
water
quality
standard
,
arguing
that
,
given
the
emphasis
on
the
quality
of
bottled
water
verses
tap
water
by
the
bottled
water
industry
,
bottlers
are
not
likely
to
print
a
`
substandard
'
statement
on
the
label
.
fda
agrees
that
bottlers
are
not
likely
to
market
bottled
water
that
would
be
required
to
bear
a
statement
of
substandard
quality
with
respect
to
lead
.
however
,
fda
notes
that
the
use
of
such
a
statement
on
the
label
of
a
food
covered
by
a
standard
of
quality
is
specifically
provided
for
by
section
403h1
)
of
the
act
(
21
usc
.
343h1
,
if
that
food
falls
below
the
prescribed
quality
standard
.
therefore
,
fda
cannot
preclude
the
use
of
the
statement
of
substandard
quality
.
nonetheless
,
§
103
35
)
provides
that
any
bottled
water
containing
a
substance
at
a
level
considered
injurious
to
health
under
section
402
of
the
act
(
21
usc
.
342
)
is
deemed
to
be
adulterated
and
may
be
subject
to
regulatory
action
,
even
if
the
bottled
water
bears
a
label
statement
of
substandard
quality
.
fda
notes
that
the
cgmp
regulations
for
processing
and
bottling
of
bottled
drinking
water
(
part
129
)
require
that
the
water
to
be
bottled
be
obtained
from
an
approved
source
properly
located
,
protected
,
and
operated
;
be
of
a
safe
,
sanitary
quality
;
and
be
in
compliance
at
all
times
with
the
applicable
laws
and
regulations
of
the
government
agency
or
agencies
having
jurisdiction
(
129
35
.
in
addition
,
§
129
35
)
requires
that
samples
of
source
water
be
analyzed
as
often
as
necessary
,
but
at
least
once
each
year
,
for
chemical
contaminants
,
and
§
129
80
)
requires
that
each
type
of
bottled
water
product
be
analyzed
at
least
annually
for
chemical
contaminants
.
moreover
,
§
129
80
)
requires
that
records
of
the
results
for
these
tests
be
maintained
at
the
plant
for
at
least
2
years
and
be
available
for
official
review
at
reasonable
times
.
fda
is
not
aware
of
any
data
or
other
information
that
suggests
that
requiring
all
bottlers
to
test
for
lead
more
frequently
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
bottled
water
is
safe
and
of
acceptable
quality
.
fda
emphasizes
that
water
bottlers
are
responsible
for
ensuring
,
through
appropriate
manufacturing
techniques
and
sufficient
quality
control
procedures
,
that
all
bottled
water
products
introduced
or
delivered
for
introduction
into
interstate
commerce
are
safe
,
wholesome
,
and
truthfully
labeled
,
and
that
they
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
quality
standard
.
therefore
,
should
any
bottler
encounter
circumstances
that
would
warrant
testing
for
lead
more
frequently
than
once
per
year
,
the
bottler
is
required
to
do
such
testing
to
ensure
the
safety
and
quality
of
the
bottled
water
.
for
the
reasons
stated
above
,
fda
concludes
that
the
testing
requirements
for
contaminants
in
bottled
water
contained
in
the
cgmp
regulations
(
part
129
)
are
appropriate
and
sufficient
to
ensure
the
quality
and
safety
of
bottled
water
products
.
thus
,
the
agency
finds
that
revision
of
the
cgmp
regulations
to
require
more
frequent
testing
for
chemical
contaminants
in
bottled
water
is
not
necessary
at
this
time
.

a
majority
of
responses
from
industry
opposed
the
exemption
of
mineral
water
from
the
lead
standard
for
bottled
water
.
another
comment
stated
that
the
lead
standard
should
apply
to
other
types
of
bottled
beverages
,
including
mineral
water
,
soda

,
and
seltzer

under
the
provisions

the
definition
of

excludes
mineral
water

any
type
of
soft

consequently

these

are
exempt

the

will
apply
to

even
if
the
agency
does
not
adopt
this
change
,
because
of
the
health
concerns
raised
by

,
the
agency
is
likely
to
take
some
action
to
regulate
the
level
of

one
comment
from
a
trade
association
representing
public
water
supply
agencies
recommended
that
fda
review
the
latest
epa
analytical
techniques
for
determining
lead
and
copper
with
respect
to
the
use
of

and
incorporate
this
procedure
as
applicable
.
in
accordance
with
fdas
responsibilities
pursuant
to
section
410
of
the
act
,
fda
consulted
with
epa
by
requesting
epas
review
and
comment
on
the
proposal
to
amend
the
quality
standard
for
lead
and
copper
in
bottled
water
.
in
response
,
epa
stated
that

regulatory
approach
for

is
consistent
with
the
intent

conclusions
the
agency
is
adopting
the
provisions
concerning
lead
and
copper
in
the
quality
standard
for
bottled
water
as
proposed
(
58
fr
389
,
01/05/1993
.
the
majority
of
the
comments
that
the
agency
received
supported
the
proposal
.
furthermore
,
after
carefully
considering
the
comments
that
the
agency
received
that
suggested
modifications
to
,
or
were
opposed
to
,
aspects
of
the
proposal
,
the
agency
has
determined
that
no
changes
are
warranted
.
therefore
,
upon
the
effective
date
of
this
rule
,
11/21/1994
,
any
bottled
water
that
contains
an
amount
of
lead
or
copper
that
exceeds
the
allowable
levels
will
be
misbranded
under
section
403h1
)
of
the
act
unless
the
bottled
water
bears
a
statement
of
substandard
quality
as
provided
by
§
103
35
.
fda
has
made
one
minor
change
concerning
the
analytical
methods
for
the
determination
of
lead
and
copper
cited
in
new
§
103
35
.
the
sources
for
these
methods
will
be

national
technical
information
services
rather
than
epa
.
this
change
is
consistent
with
the
agencys
practice
of
relying
on
readily
available
commercial
sources
for
incorporated
materials
when
possible
.
iv
.
environmental
impact
the
agency
previously
considered
the
environmental
effects
of
this
rule
,
as
announced
in
the
proposed
rule
(
58
fr
389
,
01/05/1993
.
at
that
time
,
the
agency
concluded
that
the
action
would
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
human
environment
,
and
that
an
environmental
impact
statement
is
not
required
.
the
agencys
environmental
assessment
and
finding
of
no
significant
impact
for
the
proposal
were
displayed
at
the
dockets
management
branch
at
the
time
of
the
proposal
.
fda
has
received
no
new
information
or
comments
that
would
affect
the
agencys
previous
determination
that
there
is
no
significant
impact
on
the
human
environment
,
and
that
an
environmental
impact
statement
is
not
required
.
v
.
analysis
of
impacts
fda
has
examined
the
impacts
of
the
final
rule
under
executive
order
12866
and
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
(
pub
.
l

.
executive
order
12866
directs
agencies
to
assess
all
costs
and
benefits
of
available
regulatory
alternatives
and
,
when
regulation
is
necessary
,
to
select
regulatory
approaches
that
maximize
net
benefits
(
including
potential
economic
,
environmental
,
public
health
and
safety
,
and
other
advantages
;
distributive
impacts
;
and
equity
.
the
agency
believes
that
this
final
rule
is
consistent
with
the
regulatory
philosophy
and
principles
identified
in
the
executive
order
.
in
addition
,
the
final
rule
is
not
a
significant
regulatory
action
as
defined
by
the
executive
order
and
so
is
not
subject
to
review
under
the
executive
order
.
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
requires
agencies
to
analyze
regulatory
options
that
would
minimize
any
significant
impact
of
a
rule
on
small
entities
.
because
fda
has
received
no
new
information
or
comments
that
would
alter
its
tentative
finding
in
the
proposal
that
there
is
no
substantive
economic
issue
,
the
agency
certifies
that
the
final
rule
will
not
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
.
therefore
,
under
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
,
no
further
analysis
is
required
