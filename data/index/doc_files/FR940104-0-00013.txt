examined
in
this
light
,
the
commission
now
believes
that
standard
(

)
should
be
narrowed
to
affect
only
the
disclosure
of
information
related
to
the
transportation
of
gas
.
historically
,
the
pipeline
collected
and
maintained
extensive
data
on
natural
gas
supply
and
markets

as
the
primaryif
not

of
natural

,
pipelines
had
all
of
the
data
on
production

consumption
and
markets
for
the
areas
they
served
.
however
,
pipelines
today
are
not
the
dominant
sellers
of
natural
gas
they
were
a
decade
ago
.
about
80
percent
of
the

gas

.
pipelines
will
be
afforded
substantially
less
information
about
these
types
of
transactions
than
traditionally
required
.
for
these
transactions
pipelines
know
where
the
gas
is
entering
their

,
and
where
it
is
redelivered
,
but
may
know
nothing

,
or

often
the

does
not
even
know
the
identity

.
indeed
the
theory
underlying

636
is
that
shippers
would
have
more
access
to
producers
and
marketers
to
make
their
decisions
.
but
just
as
important
is
the
fact
that
other

and

will
know
where

is
entering
and
being
redelivered

636
requires
that
this
type
of

and
through

required

to
the
extent
that
a
pipeline
collects
sales
and
marketing
information
from
public
sources
,
or
from
sources
outside
its
transportation
role
,
release
of
this
information
to
its
marketing
affiliate
generally
does
not
in
any
way
relate
to
the
pipelines
monopoly
power
over
transportation
.
unnecessary
interference
with
communications
between
a
pipeline
and
its
marketing
affiliates
would
actually
reduce
competition
,
by
inhibiting
one
segment
of
the
industry
from
vigorously
competing
with
other
natural
gas
sellers
.
to
do
otherwise
would
create
an
unlevel
playing
field
tilted
against
pipeline
merchant
service
units
or
marketing
affiliates
and
towards
producers
,
nonaffiliated
marketers
,
local
distribution
companies
(
ldcs
,
and
others
.
rather
than
a
balanced
approach
,
this
tilted
playing
field
would
give
an
unfair
advantage
to
nonpipeline
pipeline
merchants
.
the
pipeline
obtains
sales
and
marketing
information
from
the
public
domain
,
its
bundled
merchant
function
or
its
transportation
activities
.
the
public

information
should
not
trigger

following
the
tenneco
courts
reasoning
.
the
bundled
merchant
information
is
outdated
and
does
not
meet
the
current
information
standard
mentioned
by
the
court
.
and
finally
,
the

transportation
generated
sales

since

the
