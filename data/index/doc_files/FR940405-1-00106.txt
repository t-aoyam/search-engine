iaq
operation
and
maintenance
program
.
the
proposed
standard
requires
maintenance
and
inspection
of
the
building
system
components
that
directly
affect
iaq
.
specifically
,
the
hvac
system
should
provide
at
least
the
outside
air
ventilation
rate
based
on
actual
occupancy
,
building
code
,
mechanical
code
or
ventilation
code
and
that
carbon
dioxide
concentration
does
not
exceed
800
parts
per
million
.
in
approximately
500
indoor
air
quality
investigations
,
niosh
found
that
the
primary
cause
of
indoor
air
quality
problems
is
inadequate
ventilation
(
52
percent
.
other
actions
required
include
:
(
1
)
control
of
humidity
in
buildings
with
mechanical
cooling
systems
,
(
2
)
implementing
the
use
of
general
or
local
exhaust
ventilation
where
maintenance
and
housekeeping
activities
involve
use
of
equipment
or
products
which
emit
air
contaminants
in
other
areas
of
the
facility
,
(
3
)
maintain
mechanical
equipment
rooms
and
any
nonducted
ducted
air
plenums
or
chases
in
a
clean
condition
.
osha
recognizes
that
not
every
building
will
have
to
make
all
recommended
changes
to
improve
operation
and
maintenance
of
the
hvac
system
.
in
the
majority
of
the
cases
,
some
improvements
can
be
accomplished
by
changing
the
setting
on
a
control
device
or
centralized
control
system
.
depending
on
the
condition
of
the
hvac
equipment
,
inspection
and
maintenance
may
include
simple
housekeeping
of
equipment
and
air
transport
pathways
and
or
catastrophic
failure
maintenance
to
repair
replace
failed
equipment
.
also
,
there
may
be
cases
where
a
number
of
buildings
will
require
major
changes
in
the
hvac
system
such
as
enlarging
the
size
of
the
outside
air
intake
.
