cost
of
implementation
comment
:
a
commenter
disagreed
with
our
statement
in
the
impact
analysis
of
the
proposed
rule
that
hospitals
would
not
be
significantly
affected
by
electronic
cost
reporting
.
the
commenter
stated
that
some
hospitals
had
to
make
expensive
changes
in
personnel
or
software
to
comply
with
the
regulations
and
that
the
cost
of
maintaining
the
required
software
was
an
additional
burden
on
providers
.
the
commenter
suggested
that
hcfa
pay
providers
for
the
cost
of
implementing
the
electronic
cost
reporting
requirement
including
the
cost
of
equipment
,
software
,
additional
personnel
,
external
consultants
,
and
any
related
overhead
costs
.
response
:
section
1886f1b
)
of
the
act
does
not
authorize
hcfa
to
subsidize
any
of
the
costs
hospitals
incur
in
implementing
electronic
cost
reporting
.
however
,
it
does
authorize
the
waiver
or
delay
of
the
implementation
of
the
electronic
format
in
cases
of
financial
hardship
.
as
discussed
above
,
if
computer
support
required
for
electronic
cost
reporting
will
cause
financial
hardship
,
the
hospital
may
request
a
waiver
from
electronic
filing
.
v
.
provisions
of
the
final
regulations
in
this
final
rule
with
comment
,
we
are
revising
the
provisions
set
forth
in
the
proposed
rule
.
based
on
public
comment
,
we
are
eliminating
the
requirement
that
providers
file
a
hard
copy
cost
report
in
addition
to
the
electronic
file
.
also
based
on
public
comment
,
we
are
adding
a
new
paragraph
(
iii
)
to
§
413
24
)
to
provide
that
in
addition
to
the
electronic
file
,
a
hospital
must
submit
hard
copies
of
a
settlement
summary
,
a
statement
of
certain
worksheet
totals
found
in
the
electronic
file
,
and
a
signed
statement
certifying
the
accuracy
of
the
electronic
file
or
the
manually
prepared
cost
report
.
in
addition
to
the
changes
made
based
on
public
comment
,
we
are
adding
a
new
paragraph
(
ii
)
to
§
413
24
)
to
provide
the
following
:
&
bullall
cost
reporting
software
must
be
able
to
disclose
that
changes
have
been
made
to
the
electronic
file
after
the
provider
has
submitted
its
cost
report
to
the
intermediary
.
&
bullthe
intermediary
may
not
alter
the
cost
report
once
it
has
been
filed
by
the
provider
.
&
bullthe
intermediary
rejects
any
cost
report
that
does
not
pass
all
specified
edits
and
returns
it
to
the
provider
for
correction
.
as
a
result
of
the
above
changes
to
the
regulations
text
,
proposed
§

)
has
been
redesignated
as
§

.
vi
.
collection
of
information
requirements
section
413
24
of
this
final
rule
with
comment
contains
information
collection
and
recordkeeping
requirements
that
are
subject
to
review
by
the
office
of
management
and
budget
(
omb
)
under
the
paperwork
reduction
act
of
1980
(
44
usc
.
3501
et
seq
.
these
information
collection
and
recordkeeping
requirements
are
not
effective
until
they
have
been
approved
by
omb
.
we
have
submitted
a
copy
of
this
final
rule
with
comment
to
omb
for
review
of
the
information
collection
requirements
.
approximately
90
percent
of
hospitals
participating
in
medicare
have
filed
electronic
cost
reports
before
the
effective
date
of
this
regulation
,
that
is
with
cost
reporting
periods
beginning
on
or
after
10/01/1989
.
these
providers
will
now
have
to
file
a
diskette
containing
the
required
cost
report
data
in
a
standard
format
.
this
diskette
will
contain
input
data
only
.
we
believe
that
minimal
time
would
be
needed
for
hospitals
to
become
familiar
with
the
revised
software
furnished
by
their
cost
reporting
vendor
.
the
remaining
10
percent
of
the
hospitals
previously
filed
manually
prepared
cost
reports
.
while
these
hospitals
will
initially
experience
an
additional
reporting
burden
,
we
believe
that
once
they
are
familiar
with
electronic
reporting
,
there
will
no
longer
be
an
additional
burden
and
there
may
even
be
a
decrease
in
burden
since
the
time
needed
to
compute
the
cost
report
will
no
longer
be
required
.
