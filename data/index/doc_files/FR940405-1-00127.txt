conduct
and
nature
of
hearing
the
hearing
will
commence
at
930
am
.
on
the
first
day
.
at
that
time
,
any
procedural
matters
relating
to
the
proceeding
will
be
resolved
.
the
nature
of
an
informal
rulemaking
hearing
is
established
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
6
of
the
osh
act
and
is
reflected
by
oshas
rules
of
procedure
for
hearings
(
29
cfr
1911
15
.
although
the
presiding
officer
is
an
administrative
law
judge
and
questioning
by
interested
persons
is
allowed
on
crucial
issues
,
the
proceeding
is
informal
and
legislative
in
type
.
the
agencys
intent
,
in
essence
,
is
to
provide
interested
persons
with
an
opportunity
to
make
effective
oral
presentations
which
can
proceed
expeditiously
in
the
absence
of
procedural
restraints
which
impede
or
protract
the
rulemaking
process
.
additionally
,
since
the
hearing
is
primarily
for
information
gathering
and
clarification
,
it
is
an
informal
administrative
proceeding
rather
than
an
adjudicative
one
.
the
technical
rules
of
evidence
,
for
example
do
not
apply
.
the
regulations
that
govern
hearings
and
the
prehearing
hearing
guidelines
to
be
issued
for
this
hearing
will
ensure
fairness
and
due
process
and
also
facilitate
the
development
of
a
clear
,
accurate
and
complete
record
.
those
rules
and
guidelines
will
be
interpreted
in
a
manner
that
furthers
that
development
.
thus
,
questions
of
relevance
,
procedure
and
participation
generally
will
be
decided
so
as
to
favor
development
of
the
record
.
the
hearing
will
be
conducted
in
accordance
with
29
cfr
part
1911
.
it
should
be
noted
that
§
19114
specifies
the
assistant
secretary
may
upon
reasonable
notice
issue
alternatives
procedures
to
expedite
proceedings
or
for
other
good
cause
.
the
hearing
will
be
presided
over
by
an
administrative
law
judge
who
makes
no
decision
or
recommendation
on
the
merits
of
oshas
proposal
.
the
responsibility
of
the
administrative
law
judge
is
to
ensure
that
the
hearing
proceeds
at
a
reasonable
pace
and
in
an
orderly
manner
.
the
administrative
law
judge
,
therefore
,
will
have
all
the
powers
necessary
and
appropriate
to
conduct
a
full
and
fair
informal
hearing
as
provided
in
29
cfr
part
1911
including
the
powers
:
1
.
to
regulate
the
course
of
the
proceedings
;
2
.
to
dispose
of
procedural
requests
,
objections
and
comparable
matters
;
3
.
to
confine
the
presentations
to
the
matters
pertinent
to
the
issues
raised
;
4
.
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
those
present
at
the
hearing
by
appropriate
means
;
5
.
in
the
judges
discretion
,
to
question
and
permit
the
questioning
of
any
witness
and
to
limit
the
time
for
questioning
;
and
6
.
in
the
judges
discretion
,
to
keep
the
record
open
for
a
reasonable
,
stated
time
(
known
as
the
posthearing
hearing
comment
period
)
to
receive
written
information
and
additional
data
,
views
and
arguments
from
any
person
who
has
participated
in
the
oral
proceedings
.
osha
recognizes
that
there
may
be
interested
persons
or
organizations
who
,
through
their
knowledge
of
the
subject
matter
or
their
experience
in
the
field
,
would
wish
to
endorse
or
support
the
whole
proposal
or
certain
provisions
of
the
proposal
.
osha
welcomes
such
supportive
comments
,
including
any
pertinent
data
and
cost
information
which
may
be
available
,
in
order
that
the
record
of
this
rulemaking
will
present
a
balanced
picture
of
the
public
response
on
the
issues
involved
.
