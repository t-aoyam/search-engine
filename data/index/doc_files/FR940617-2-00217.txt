how
and
when
will
i
be
notified
about
the
status
of
my
proposal
?
headquarters
and
each
regional
office
set
up
their
own
processes
for
notifying
applicants
about
the
status
of
their
proposals
.
our
goal
is
to
keep
applicants
informed
as
much
as
possible
about
the
status
of
their
proposals
and
to
assist
those
applicants
who
do
not
receive
funding
to
successfully
compete
in
future
years
.
to
this
end
,
all
applicants
will
be
notified
(
in
mid12/19/1994
mid
)
after
their
preapplications
applications
have
been
received
and
entered
into
a
computerized
data
base
,
and
again
(
in
late
april
to
early
05/19/1995
)
after
awards
have
been
announced
.
to
the
extent
possible
,
epa
will
also
provide
applicants
with
feedback
on
those
proposals
which
were
screened
out
of
the
process
early
and
on
how
proposals
were
evaluated
.
the
degree
to
which
epa
can
provide
such
feedback
will
vary
among
epa
offices
depending
upon
the
availability
of
resources
to
conduct
these
activities
.

where

obtain
more
information
on
possible
sources
of

this
program

the
large
number
of
preapplications
applications
epa
received
in
fiscal
years
1992
,
1993
,
and
1994
demonstrates
the
strong
demand
for
funding
environmental
education
projects
.
epa
expects
an
equally
large
demand
for
funding
for
fiscal
year
1995
.
unfortunately
,
epa
alone
cannot
meet
this
demand
.
thus
,
in
cooperation
with
epa
,
the
north
american
association
for
environmental
education
(
naaee
)
has
developed
a
publication
called
`
grant
funding
for
your
environmental
education
program
'
which
provides
strategies
for
identifying
potential
sources
of
funding
.
