background
:
based
on
the
encouraging
response
to
the
announcement
for
public
information
and
community
awareness
grants
for
family
violence
prevention
in
federal
fiscal
years
1992
and
1993
,
acf
plans
to
again
make
these
grants
available
in
fy
1994
.
the
public
information
community
awareness
grant
awards
have
spawned
very
effective
informational
activities
at
the
local
levels
.
these
grants
have
assisted
community
organizations
to
focus
on
and
emphasize
prevention
,
helped
to
make
available
public
service
announcements
and
legal
brochures
in
several
different
languages
,
including
russian
and
vietnamese
,
and
have
assisted
in
the
implementation
of
conflict
resolution
activities
in
elementary
,
middle
and
high
school
curricula
.
the
goal
of
this
priority
area
is
to
continue
to
add
credible
and
persuasive
information
to
the
arsenal
of
weapons
necessary
and
available
to
community
organizations
to
help
break
the
socalled
so
called
`
cycle
of
family
violence
'
the
continuation
of
these
efforts
will
help
assure
that
individuals
,
particularly
within
minority
communities
,
are
aware
of
available
resources
and
alternative
responses
for
the
resolution
and
the
prevention
of
violence
.
the
proposed
grant
awards
will
provide
support
for
a
model
that
provides
for
a
more
informed
individual
and
thus
,
more
effective
prevention
strategies
on
the
part
of
that
individual
.
the
focus
of
this
priority
area
requires
the
development
and
implementation
of
an
innovative
public
information
campaign
model
that
may
be
used
,
for
example
,
by
public
and
private
agencies
,
schools
,
churches
,
boys
and
girls
clubs
,
community
organizations
,
and
individuals
.
the
acf
support
for
the
continued
increase
of
information
on
services
and
other
alternatives
for
the
prevention
of
family
violence
promotes
the
concepts
that
this
behavior
is
unacceptable
and
that
victims
,
their
dependents
,
and
perpetrators
need
to
be
provided
with
remedial
and
service
options
for
their
particular
situations
.
accurate
information
is
critical
to
any
community
awareness
strategy
and
activity
.
how
information
is
communicated
must
be
modified
where
communication
barriers
may
exist
because
of
perceived
or
real
language
differences
and
cultural
insensitivities
.
