whereas
,
the
goal
of
the
fia
is
to
develop
a
program
with
the
insurance
industry
where
,
over
time
,
some
riskbearing
risk
bearing
role
for
the
industry
will
evolve
as
intended
by
the
congress
(
section
1304
of
the
act
;
and
whereas
,
the
program
,
as
presently
constituted
and
implemented
,
is
subsidized
,
and
the
insurer
(
hereinafter
the
`
company
)
under
this
arrangement
shall
charge
rates
established
by
the
fia
;
and
whereas
,
this
arrangement
will
subsidize
all
flood
policy
losses
by
the
company
;
and
whereas
,
this
financial
assistance
subsidy
arrangement
has
been
developed
to
involve
individual
companies
in
the
program
,
the
initial
step
of
which
is
to
explore
ways
in
which
any
interested
insurer
may
be
able
to
write
flood
insurance
under
its
own
name
;
and
whereas
,
one
of
the
primary
objectives
of
the
program
is
to
provide
coverage
to
the
maximum
number
of
structures
at
risk
and
because
the
insurance
industry
has
marketing
access
through
its
existing
facilities
not
directly
available
to
the
fia
,
it
has
been
concluded
that
coverage
will
be
extended
to
those
who
would
not
otherwise
be
insured
under
the
program
;
and
whereas
,
flood
insurance
policies
issued
subject
to
this
arrangement
shall
be
only
that
insurance
written
by
the
company
in
its
own
name
pursuant
to
the
act
;
and
whereas
,
over
time
,
the
program
is
designed
to
increase
industry
participation
,
and
,
accordingly
,
reduce
or
eliminate
government
as
the
principal
vehicle
for
delivering
flood
insurance
to
the
public
;
and
whereas
,
the
direct
beneficiaries
of
this
arrangement
will
be
those
company
policyholders
and
applicants
for
flood
insurance
who
otherwise
would
not
be
covered
against
the
peril
of
flood
.
