mr

with
others
in

osha
has
accepted
these
suggestions
and
has
issued
a
separate

final
standard
for
shipyards
.
its
specific
provisions
are
discussed
in
appropriate
places

training
must
be
given
to
virtually
all
employees
who
are
actively
exposed
to
asbestos
,
ie
.
whose
exposure
is
the
result
of
performing
class
i
through
iv
work
,
or
who
install
new
asbestos
products

under

along

become

,
at

time
of

:

inspectors

in
addition
,
asbestos

contractors

must
take

and
asbestos

workers
are
required
to
take

pursuant

under

the
length
of

now
must
take
a
4day

rather
than

,
the

for
example
,
for
abatement
workers
14
hours
of

hands
on

must
be
included
in
the
4day
day

course

the
training
provisions
in
the
new
standard
correspond
to
the
class
of
work
performed
.
for
class
i
and
ii
work
,
employers
must
provide
employees
with
a
training
course

is
the
equivalent

osha
asked
for
comment
on
whether
osha
should
provide

certification
for

and
on
whether
and
how
