section
112
of
the
act
specifies
that
the
mact
floor
for
new
sources
shall
be
no
less
stringent
than
the
level
of
control
that
is
achieved
in
practice
by
the
best
controlled
similar
source
.
the
committee
determined
the
mact
floor
for
new
sources
using
an
approach
similar
to
that
for
existing
sources
;
that
is
,
one
that
represents
the
multiple
industry
segments
within
the
source
category
.
for
new
sources
,
the
mact
floor
was
calculated
by
determining
the
hap
limit
of
the
best
performing
source
in
each
industry
segment
that
comprised
the
existing
source
mact
floor
(
kitchen
cabinets
,
residential
furniture
,
radio
tv
cabinets
,
office
furniture
.
then
,
a
weighted
average
(
weighted
by
the
relative
coating
usage
of
each
industry
segment
)
was
calculated
to
determine
the
hap
limit
for
new
sources
.
this
hap
limit
was
calculated
to
be
08
lb
vhap

(
08

,
as
applied
,
and
is

for

for
all

segments

mact
floor
for
gluing
operations
.
the
proposed
standards
would
only
regulate
the
hap
content
of
contact
adhesives
.
hot
melts
are
not
sources
of
hap
emissions
,
there
are
no
lower
emitting
alternatives
for
pva
adhesives
,
and
regulation
of
formaldehyde
based
adhesives
is
being
deferred
to
later
rulemaking
.
as
discussed
in
section
ii
,
contact
adhesives
are
used
primarily
for
laminating
and
for
upholstery
operations
.
contact
adhesives
used
for
upholstery
operations
are
also
referred
to
as
foam
adhesives
.
the
emission
limit
for
contact
adhesives
is
expressed
as
a
hap
limit
,
in
pounds
of
vhap
per
pound
of
solids
,
as
applied
.
the
mact
floor
for
contact
adhesives
was
determined
as
an
average
(
equivalent
to
the
mean
)
of
the
hap
limit
achieved
by
the
best
performing
12
percent
of
contact
adhesives
used
by
major
sources
in
quantities
greater
than
200
gallons
per
year
;
this
limit
was
calculated
as
1
lb
vhap
lb
solids
(
1
kg
vhap
kg
solids
,
as
applied
.
the
hap
limit
for
each
contact
adhesive
was
determined
from
data
provided
by
the
adhesive
supplier
for
each
major
source
in
the
epas
data
base
using
contact
adhesives
.
the
hap
limit
for
the
lowest
emitting
contact
adhesive
is
02
lb
vhap
lb
solids
,
as
applied
.
thus
,
the
mact
floor
for
contact
adhesives
used
by
new
sources
is
a
hap
content
of
no
more
than
02
lb
hap
lb
solids
(
02
kg
vhap
kg
solids
,
as
applied
.

.
selection
of
mact
the
committee
proposed
that
mact
for
finishing
operations
should
be
set
at
the
same
level
as
the
mact
floor
.
this
proposal
was
supported
by
review
of
the
data
on
which
the
mact
floor
is
based
.
the
committee
determined
that
hap
emission
limits
substantially
lower
than
the
mact
floor
were
not
being
met
,
nor
could
they
be
met
by
most
facilities
in
the
industry
segments
comprising
the
mact
floor
.
it
is
expected
that
most
sources
will
comply
with
the
proposed
standards
by
reformulating
existing
coatings
.
control
devices
are
not
widely
used
by
sources
covered
by
the
proposed
rule
to
control
emissions
from
finishing
operations
.
in
addition
,
state
rules
do
not
require
this
level
of
control
,
and
the
committee
did
not
favor
a
proposal
that
would
mandate
the
use
of
control
devices
.
thus
,
more
stringent
control
could
only
be
achieved
in
most
cases
by
the
exclusive
use
of
coatings
with
a
very
low
-
or
zerohap
zero
hap
content
.
currently
,
finishing
materials
with
a
very
low
or
zerohap
zero
hap
content
have
not
been
demonstrated
to
be
feasible
for
all
industry
segments
.
another
factor
that
the
committee
evaluated
in
selecting
mact
was
the
impact
of
the
proposed
rule
when
the
work
practice
standards
are
considered
.
these
standards
will
result
in
additional
reduction
in
hap
emissions
.
because
numerical
limits
are
not
assigned
to
all
work
practice
standards
,
the
total
reduction
in
emissions
that
results
from
implementing
such
standards
is
not
quantified
.
given
that
an
emission
limit
more
stringent
than
the
mact
floor
could
not
be
achieved
by
all
segments
of
the
industry
and
the
fact
that
work
practices
will
further
reduce
hap
emissions
,
the
committee
favored
setting
the
finishing
material
emission
limits
based
on
the
mact
floor
.
in
selecting
mact
,
the
industry
members
of
the
committee
raised
the
possibility
that
epa
might
,
at
some
future
time
,
conduct
rulemaking
activities
to
expand
or
reduce
the
current
hap
list
.
the
emission
limits
calculated
for
the
wood
furniture
neshap
were
based
on
the
list
of
189
hazardous
air
pollutants
published
in
the
1990
clean
air
act
and
were
not
intended
to
apply
to
any
changes
that
may
be
made
to
the
list
in
the
future
.
in
the
event
the
list
is
changed
,
either
by
the
addition
or
deletion
of
vhap
,
the
committee
recommended
that
epa
reexamine
examine
the
wood
furniture
emission
limits
and
determine
whether
it
should
be
adjusted
to
account
for
the
change
.
