osha
responded
in
1990
,
by
proposing
a
new
provision
to
require
employers
to
notify
osha
in
writing
prior
to
engaging
in
demolition
,
renovation
,
and
removal
operations
which
are

oshas
proposed
notice
requirement
shared
many
core
elements
with
epas
then
current
and
proposed
notification
requirements
under
neshaps
.
osha
noted
that
`
the
proposed
notification
is
modeled
after
the
notification
requirement
concerning
asbestos
abatement
projects
that
occur
in
conjunction
with
building
demolition
and
renovation
operations
.
osha
noted
further
that
`
employers
can
satisfy
the
osha
(
proposed
)
notification
requirement
simply
by
forwarding
a
copy
of
the
epa
form
to
the
osha
area
office
when
complying
with
epas

neshap

both
epas
and
oshas
proposed
,
notification
requirements
would
exempt
less
extensive
operations
.
in
oshas
case
,
the
exemption
would

.
osha
noted
that
many
asbestos
jobs
would
meet
the
notification
requirements
of
both
agencies
,
however
there
would
be
an
indeterminate
,
yet
significant
number
for
which
epa
notification
would
not
be
called
for
,
but
oshas
proposed
requirement
would
apply
.
most
public
comment
opposed
the
requirement
.
the
major
objection
was
the
burden
on
the
employer
from
completing
and
mailing
the
notification
form
.
further
,
some
commenters
questioned
the
overall
usefulness
of
the
notification
requirement
in
promoting
compliance
(

comments
of

)
bctd
continued
to
argue
for
extensive
reporting
requirements
for
the
reasons
stated
above
.
a
few
other
commenters
supported
its
position
.

osha
has
carefully
reviewed
all
the
comments
.
based
on
the
review
and
subsequent
developments
,
the
final
regulation
scales
down
oshas
proposed
notice
requirements
.
osha
is
now
requiring
advance
notification
of
class
i
(
mainly
largescale
large
scale
removals
)
only
when
the
employer
intends
to
utilize
controls
other
than
a
negative
pressure
enclosure
which
meets
the
requirements
of
paragraph
(
g
)
of
this
standard
,
and
in
some
circumstances
,
where
modifications
of
glove
bag
systems
,
glove
box
systems
and
other
control
systems
described
in
paragraph
(
g
)
are
made
.
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
for
oshas
decisions
.
osha
believes
that
the
potential
benefits
in
direct
risk
reduction
from
a
separate
osha
reporting
requirement
are
unlikely
.
there
are
already
extensive
epa
and
state
reporting
requirements
which
osha
requirements
would
partly
duplicate
.
the
epa
and
state
requirements
already
create
any
incentive
to
comply
that
such
reports
could
create
.
similar
osha
reports
would
not
increase
this
benefit
.
information
which
may
be
useful
to
osha
in
targeting
inspections
can
be
retrieved
by
informationsharing
information
sharing
with
the
epa
while
avoiding
overlapping
reports
.
osha
notes
that
the
paperwork
reduction
act
requires
that
federal
agencies
avoid
clearly
duplicative
reporting
requirements
.
various
comments
challenge
the
value
of
duplicative
requirements
(
eg
,
ex
.

,
720
,

,

.
thus
,
although
oshas
and
epas
reporting
requirements
are
only
partially
duplicative
,
these
considerations
have
influenced
oshas
decision
not
to
require
extensive
prejob
job
reporting
.
osha
is
concerned
that
in
reviewing
the
volume
of
reports
which
may
be
spawned
by
a
separate
osha
requirement
which
exceeded
the
epa
requirements
would
strain
osha
area
offices
enforcement
resources
and
drain
such
resources
from
other
enforcement
efforts
.
however
,
osha
finds
that
advance
reporting
is
appropriate
where
information
is
related
to
new
or
modified
control
methods
for
class
i
work
.
in
such
cases
,
heightened
attention
to
the
data
supporting
their
use
will
result
from
the
requirement
to
send
them
to
osha
.
bctds
contrary
view
that
compliance
would
be
enhanced
was
based
in
part
on
its
contractors
report
,
submitted
after
the
1984
hearing
.
the
report
estimated
that
an
advance
reporting
requirement
would
reduce
`
the
number
of
workers
with
twa
exposures
over
01
f
cc
'
up
to
30
%
in
drywall
removal
and
demolition
,
and
lesser
amounts
in
other
construction
work
.
these
estimates
were
based
on
the
opinions
of
a
seven
person
`
focus
group
'
which
included
three
representatives
of
member
unions
of
bctd
.
no
methodology
was
presented
for
deriving
these
quantitative
estimates
,
and
no
supporting
data
has
been
submitted
in
either
rulemaking
(
see
brief
ex
.
143
at
198
.
the
court
referred
to
the
report
in
its
decision
as
uncontradicted
,
but
that
was
because
it
was
submitted
late
in
the
rulemaking
procedures
.
the
agency
believes
based
on
its
experience
that
these
estimates
of
specific
quantifiable
benefits
are
speculative
.
but
more
importantly
,
the
nowexisting
now
existing
epa
and
state
reporting
requirements
and
oshas
use
of
that
data
for
targeting
inspections
will
achieve
those
benefits
without
duplicative
reporting
requirements
.
further
,
osha
made
various
changes
to
the
final
standard
which
will
also
achieve
some
of
these
benefits
.
these
include
the
expanded
provisions
on
hazard
communication
,
which
will
alert
employees
in
all
asbestos
renovation
,
removal
and
maintenance
work
that
presumed
asbestos
containing
material
is
present
;
that
require
competent
persons
to
evaluate
the
work
site
before
work
is
begun
,
by
informing
employers
that
osha
is
setting
up
information
sharing
systems
with
epa
to
access
employer
notices
sent
to
that
agency
,
and
that
require
employers
who
use
new
and
modified
control
systems
to
notify
osha
.
help
for
osha
in
targeting
inspections
from
the
submission
of
advance
reports
is
the
other
claimed
benefit
from
a
reporting
requirement
.
some
participants
claimed
that
because
prejob
job
reporting
was
helpful
to
epa
in
targeting
its
inspections
for
compliance
with
neshap
requirements
,
an
osha
prejob
job
reporting
would
similarly
benefit
this
agency
.
epa
did
not
testify
at
the
hearing
,
but
available
information
shows
that
its
reporting
system
provides
useful
information
to
that
agencys
enforcement
program
.
neshaps
reporting
is
made
mostly
to
45
state
agencies
,
delegated
by
epa
to
implement
the
asbestos
neshap
.
reporting
in
epa
region
ii
,
is
directly
to
the
regional
office
.
these
reports
are
the
source
of
two
data
bases
:
the
national
asbestos
registry
system
(
nars
,
which
develops
a
historical
record
of
asbestos
contractors
,
updated
quarterly
:
and
the
acts
system
,
which
is
a
local
data
base
on
the
compliance
history
of
each
contractor
.
osha
is
informed
that
acts
is
a
tool
that
delegated
agencies
may
use
for
daytoday
day
to
day
tracking
of
asbestos
activities
.
epas
evaluation
of
the
reports
submitted
to
it
and
other
information
used
in
its
neshap
enforcement
effort
constitute
a
valuable
resource
for
osha
.
