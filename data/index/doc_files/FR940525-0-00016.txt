of

standard

to
permit
the
use
of
any
form
of
marine

that
has
been
affirmed
as

or
approved
as
a
food

for
this
use
as
an

or

in

.
interested
persons
were
given
until
10/29/1990
,
to
submit
comments
.
ii
.
the
tentative
final
rule
the
nfmoa
petition
was
filed
under
section
701e
)
of
the
federal
food
,
drug
,
and
cosmetic
act
(
the
act
)
(
21
usc
.
371e
,
which
requires
formal
rulemaking
in
any
action
for
the
amendment
of
a
food
standard
.
however
,
in
11/19/1990
,
the
nutrition
labeling
and
education
act
of
1990
(
pub
.
l
.
101535
)
was
signed
into
law
,
and
it
removed
food
standard
rulemaking
proceedings
,
except
for
actions
for
the
amendment
or
repeal
of
food
standards
of
identity
for
dairy
products
or
maple
sirup
,
from
the
formal
rulemaking
proceedings
of
section
701e
)
of
the
act
.
therefore
,
further
action
on
the
nfmoa
petition
would
be
subject
to
the
informal
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
proceedings
of
section
701a
)
of
the
act
.
thus
,
the
agency
published
a
tentative
final
rule
in
the
federal
register
of
08/17/1993
(
58
fr
43580
,
under
those
procedures
.
because
there
had
been
an
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
proposal
when
it
was
published
in
1990
,
the
comment
period
on
that
tentative
final
rule
was
30
days
.
iii
.
comments
fda
received
one
comment
in
response
to
the
tentative
final
rule
.
this
comment
,
submitted
by
the
petitioner
,
expressed
support
for
the
rule
and
urged
the
agency
to
finalize
the
rule
as
soon
as
possible
.
nfmoa
also
stated
that
it
would
like
to
make
clear
for
the
record
that
its
petition
did
not
ask
fda
to
approve
the
use
of
any
form
of
marine
oil
but
was
instead
restricted
to
`
any
safe
and
suitable
form
of
menhaden
oil
'
the
comment
stated
that
,
nevertheless
,
it
had
no
objection
to
fdas
enlargement
of
the
range
of
oils
to
be
permitted
by
the
amended
regulation
,
from
menhaden
oil
to
marine
oil
,
provided
that
this
change
does
not
result
in
any
further
delay
in
the
rulemaking
proceeding
.
the
agency
acknowledges
that
the
petitioner
only
sought
to
provide
for
safe
and
suitable
forms
of
menhaden
oil
in
margarine
.
however
,
fda
believes
that
it
is
appropriate
to
provide
for
oil
of
any
marine
species
where
such
oil
has
been
affirmed
as
gras
or
approved
as
a
food
additive
for
this
use
.
the
broader
provision
in
the
standard
of
identity
will
eliminate
the
need
to
amend
the
standard
of
identity
for
margarine
should
other
oils
of
marine
species
be
found
to
be
safe
and
suitable
for
use
in
this
food
.
fda
also
notes
that
ingredient
labeling
will
inform
consumers
of
the
presence
of
such
oils
when
used
in
margarine
.
therefore
,
having
received
no
adverse
comments
,
the
agency
is
revising
the
margarine
standard
as
proposed
in
the
tentative
final
rule
.
the
agency
believes
that
providing
for
optional
oils
of
marine
species
that
have
been
affirmed
as
gras
or
listed
as
a
food
additive
for
this
use
will
increase
manufacturers
'
options
in
the
selection
of
oil
ingredients
for
margarine
and
will
provide
for
a
wider
variety
of
margarine
products
in
the
marketplace
.
thus
,
the
agency
concludes
that
the
proposed
change
in
the
standard
of
identity
for
margarine
will
promote
honesty
and
fair
dealing
in
the
interest
of
consumers
.
accordingly
,
after
consideration
of
the
comments
,
the
agency
is
issuing
this
final
rule
to
amend
the
standard
of
identity
for
margarine
in
§
166
110
as
set
forth
below

the

proposal
that
this
action
would
not
result
in
a
significant
economic
impact
on

may
continue

using

.
thus
,
no
changes
are
required
in

unless
manufacturers
wish
to
reformulate
their
products
.
fda
has
received
no
new
information
or
comments
that
would
alter
its
tentative
finding
that
there
is
no
substantive
economic
issue
in

concludes

not

nor

in

the

certifies
that

environmental
impact
in
the
preamble
to
the
08/30/1990
,
proposed
rule
,
fda
reported
its
finding
that
this
action
qualified
for
categorical
exclusion
under
21
cfr
25

)
and
that
neither
an
environmental
assessment
(
ea
)
nor
an
environmental
impact
statement
was
required
.
as
noted
in
the
tentative
final
rule
,
fda
received
one
comment
on
the
proposed
rule
that
claimed
that
this
action
would
result
in
increased
fishing
pressure
that
could
adversely
affect
the
menhaden
fishery
,
and
that
the
agency
had
not
considered
this
potential
impact
prior
to
issuing
the
proposed
rule
.
although
the
comment
did
not
provide
evidence
to
support
the
contention
that
the
menhaden
fishery
would
be
adversely
affected
,
fda
requested
an
ea
from
the
petitioner
.
the
decision
to
ask
for
an
ea
takes
into
consideration
the
agencys
assessment
of
this
issue
as
part
of
its
previous
action
to
affirm
partially
hydrogenated
menhaden
oil
and
hydrogenated
menhaden
oil
as
gras
for
use
as
edible
fats
or
oils
(
54
fr
38219
,
09/15/1989
.
the
agency
also
has
information
indicating
that
the
market
for
menhaden
oil
as
a
component
of
margarine
is
large
,
approximately
40
million
pounds
per
year
.
based
on
information
in
the
petitioners
ea
submitted
for
the
current
action
and
on
the
agencys
analysis
of
the
reports
on
the
menhaden
fisheries
issued
subsequent
to
fda
approval
of
gras
petition
(
grasp

(
54
fr
38219
,
fda
concluded
in
the
08/17/1993
,
tentative
final
rule
that
the
proposed
action
would
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
menhaden
fishery
.
amending
the
margarine
standard
of
identity
will
not
increase
the
volume
of
crude
menhaden
oil
that
is
produced
.
the
only
change
will
be
that
crude
menhaden
oil
will
more
often
be
retained
in
the
united
states
for
further
processing
into
food
grade
products
,
instead
of
being
shipped
to
europe
and
elsewhere
for
this
same
use
.
thus
,
fda
carefully
considered
the
potential
environmental
effects
of
this
action
,
including
the
effects
on
the
menhaden
fishery
and
concluded
that
the
action
will
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
human
environment
,
and
that
an
environmental
impact
statement
is
not
