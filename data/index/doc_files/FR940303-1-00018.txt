there
are
two
especially
important
provisions
that
should
be
addressed
.
first
,
§
913
240
prohibits
a
government
attorney
from
communicating
with
a
person
known
to
be
represented
by
counsel
who
the
government
attorney
knows
is
a
target
of
a
federal
criminal
or
civil
enforcement
investigation
.
the
manual
provides
several
exceptions
to
this
general
prohibition
,
including
the
following
:
when
the
communication
is
initiated
by
the
target
;
when
the
communication
occurs
at
the
time
of
arrest
and
the
represented
person
has
waived
his
or
her
constitutional
rights
;
when
the
government
attorney
believes
the
contact
is
necessary
to
protect
against
a
risk
to
human
life
or
safety
;
or
when
a
senior
department
official
determines
that
exigent
circumstances
exist
,
making
the
communication
necessary
for
effective
law
enforcement
.
in
addition
,
§
913
220
provides
an
exception
to
the
general
prohibition
if
the
communication
is
made
in
the
course
of
an
undercover
investigation
.
`
target
'
is
defined
as
a
`
person
as
to
whom
the
attorney
for
the
government
has
substantial
evidence
linking
that
person
to
the
commission
of
a
crime
or
to
other
wrongful
conduct
and
as
to
whom
the
attorney
for
the
government
anticipates
seeking
an
indictment
or
naming
as
a
defendant
in
a
civil
law
enforcement
proceeding
'
because
an
individual
who
is
a
target
of
a
federal
investigation
is
typically
in
a
clearly
adversarial
relationship
with
the
federal
government
,
the
department
believes
that
the
principles
underlying
dr
7104
and
rule
42
are
implicated
and
an
extension
of
the
prohibition
contained
in
the
rule
is
appropriate
.
in
its
enforcement
of
this
provision
,
the
department
intends
to
give
substantial
deference
to
a
federal
attorneys
good
faith
judgment
regarding
the
likelihood
that
a
particular
person
will
ultimately
become
a
defendant
.
even
if
the
attorney
for
the
government
believes
that
an
individual
will
probably
be
named
as
a
defendant
,
that
individual
is
not
considered
a
target
until
the
government
has
actually
obtained
substantial
evidence
linking
that
individual
to
the
commission
of
a
crime
or
to
unlawful
conduct
.
the
government
attorneys
uncorroborated
belief
that
an
individual
will
ultimately
be
named
as
a
defendant
is
not
enough
.
thus
,
an
individual
is
not
considered
a
target
under
this
rule
until
both
the
attorney
for
the
government
believes
that
he
or
she
will
probably
be
named
as
a
defendant
and
substantial
evidence
has
been
obtained
.
the
second
provision
that
should
be
noted
is
the
approval
procedure
provided
in
§
913
250
.
under
that
provision
,
before
an
attorney
for
the
government
communicates
with
any
represented
party
or
target
,
the
government
attorney
should
obtain
the
approval
of
the
united
states
attorney
if
the
attorney
is
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
,
or
the
approval
of
another
appropriate
supervisor
.
the
provision
also
permits
contacts
when
prior
approval
is
not
feasible
,
and
requires
postcontact
contact
documentation
.
additions
to
the
united
states
attorneys
'
manual
the
entire
text
of
the
planned
additions
to
the
manual
follows
:
the
following
new
section
is
added
to
title
9
,
chapter
13
.
913
200

210
generally
28
cfr
part
77
generally
governs
communications
with
represented
persons
in
law
enforcement
investigations
and
proceedings
.
this
section
sets
forth
several
additional
departmental
policies
and
procedures
with
regard
to
such
communications
.
department
of
justice
attorneys
should
recognize
that
communications
with
represented
persons
at
any
stage
may
present
the
potential
for
undue
interference
with
attorneyclient
attorney
client
relationships
and
should
undertake
any
such
communications
with
great
circumspection
and
care
.
this
department
as
a
matter
of
policy
will
respect
bona
fide
attorneyclient
attorney
client
relationships
whenever
possible
,
consistent
with
our
law
enforcement
responsibilities
and
duties
.
the
rules
set
forth
in
28
cfr
part
77
are
intended
,
among
other
things
,
to
clarify
the
circumstances
under
which
government
attorneys
may
communicate
with
represented
persons
.
they
are
not
intended
to
create
any
presumption
that
communications
are
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
course
of
any
particular
investigation
or
proceeding
.
whether
such
a
communication
is
appropriate
in
a
particular
situation
is
to
be
determined
by
the
government
attorney
(
and
,
when
appropriate
,
his
or
her
supervisors
)
in
the
exercise
of
his
or
her
discretion
,
based
on
the
specific
circumstances
of
the
individual
case
.
furthermore
,
the
application
of
this
section
,
like
the
application
of
28
cfr
part
77
,
is
limited
to
communications
between
department
of
justice
attorneys
and
persons
known
to
be
represented
by
counsel
during
criminal
investigations
and
proceedings
or
civil
law
enforcement
investigations
and
proceedings
.
these
provisions
do
not
apply
to
department
attorneys
engaged
in
civil
suits
in
which
the
united
states
is
not
acting
under
its
police
or
regulatory
powers
.
thus
,
state
bar
rules
and
not
these
provisions
will
generally
apply
in
civil
suits
when
the
government
is
a
defendant
or
a
claimant
.
attorneys
for
the
government
are
strongly
encouraged
to
consult
with
appropriate
officials
in
the
department
of
justice
when
the
application
or
interpretation
of
28
cfr
part
77
may
be
doubtful
or
uncertain
.
the
primary
points
of
contact
at
the
department
of
justice
on
questions
regarding
28
cfr
part
77
and
this
section
are
the
assistant
attorneys
general
of
the
criminal
and
civil
divisions
,
or
their
designees
.
913
220

the
presence
of

that
are
intended
to
obtain
factual
information
in
the
course
of
