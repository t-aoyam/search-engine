in
04/19/1992
,
fws
applied
for
a
modification
to
its
scientific
research
permit
in
order
to
initiate
a
captive
breeding
program
using
about
1000
juveniles
that
remained
from
the
hatchery
propagation
effort
in
1991
.
a
primary
objective
of
this
program
was
to
provide
insurance
against
extinction
or
loss
of
unique
genetic
variability
until
the
wild
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
population
began
to
recover
.
the
goal
of
the
program
is
to
produce
about
200
mature
broodstock
for
each
of
three
consecutive
years
beginning
in
1994
.
the
fws
transferred
approximately
750
of
the
juveniles
produced
from
adults
captured
during
the
1991
spawning
run
to
the
university
of
californias
bodega
marine
laboratory
in
09/19/1992
for
extended
captive
rearing
.
a
small
number
of
these
juveniles
(
approximately
50
)
were
subsequently
transferred
to
steinhart
aquarium
in
san
francisco
during
03/19/1993
for
further
rearing
and
display
.
additional
juveniles
produced
from
adults
collected
and
spawned
in
1992
were
transferred
from
the
hatchery
to
bodega
marine
laboratory
for
extended
rearing
in
02/19/1993
.
as
of
09/19/1993
,
the
bodega
marine
lab
was
rearing
approximately
425
fish
from
the
1991
broodyear
and
approximately
640
fish
from
the
1992
broodyear
.
a
portion
of
the
surviving
adults
produced
from
the
1991
and
1992
broodyears
may
eventually
be
returned
to
the
hatchery
for
use
as
broodstock
.
however
,
these
captively
reared
adults
will
not
be
used
in
any
matings
nor
can
their
progeny
be
released
into
the
wild
until
after
nmfs
and
fws
have
concluded
the
ongoing
section
7
consultation
that
is
addressing
the
potential
adverse
effects
of
the
captive
broodstock
program
on
wild
fish
,
and
nmfs
has
amended
the
fwss
existing
esa

.
disease
or
predation
the
magnitude
and
extent
of
predation
on
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
in
the
sacramento
river
and
sacramentosan
sacramento
san
joaquin
delta
are
poorly
known
.
however
,
studies
by
the
fws
have
found
that
predation
at
red
bluff
diversion
dam
,
primarily
by
squawfish
,
significantly
contributes
to
the
mortality
of
downstream
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
migrants
.
the
fws
has
undertaken
periodic
electrofishing
below
the
dam
which
may
be
useful
in
developing
a
relative
squawfish
abundance
index
.
all
of
the
fisheries
agencies
believe
that
before
squawfish
control
is
possible
,
more
must
be
learned
about
their
life
history
.
in
1992
,
the
fws
conducted
limited
studies
of
predation
at
the
fish
bypass
outfall
as
part
of
its
continuing
evaluation
of
the
dam
and
the
new
screens
that
were
installed
in
1990
.
nmfs
has
addressed
this
problem
,
in
part
,
by
requiring
the
bureau
,
through
the
1993
biological
opinion
on
longterm
long
term
operations
of
the
central
valley
project
,
to
maintain
the
red
bluff
diversion
dam
gates
in
the
raised
position
during
most
of
the
outmigration
period
.
this
action
is
expected
to
reduce
substantially
the
adverse
effects
of
predation
at
the
dam
on
juvenile
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
the
potential
for
high
levels
of
predation
on
juvenile
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
also
exist
at
the
glencolusa
glen
colusa
irrigation
district
(
gcid
)
diversion
facility
and
other
manmade
structures
such
as
the
california
department
of
water
resources
suisun
marsh
salinity
control
structure
and
clifton
court
forebay
in
the
southern
delta
.
predation
studies
conducted
by
the
cdfg
in
forebay
indicate
that
the
prescreening
screening
mortality
of
marked
salmonids
,
primarily
due
to
predation
by
striped
bass
,
is
approximately
75
percent
.
squawfish
and
striped
bass
predation
has
also
been
observed
on
juvenile
salmonids
released
back
into
the
sacramento
river
from
salvage
operations
conducted
by
the
cdfg
at
state
and
federal
fish
protection
facilities
in
the
lower
sacramentosan
sacramento
san
joaquin
delta
.
