the
epa
also
evaluated
the
potential
of
addon
add
on
voc
control
devices
(
ie
,
carbon
adsorbers
and
incinerators
.
although
no
cases
are
known
where
addon
add
on
controls
are
used
for
outdoor
painting
at
shipyards
,
they
have
been
used
to
reduce
spraybooth
emissions
by
many
other
industries
.
most
coating
operations
at
shipyards
take
place
outdoors
,
primarily
because
of
the
size
of
parts
painted
.
this
makes
capture
of
emissions
difficult
and
expensive
.
use
of
addon
add
on
controls
for
outdoor
painting
was
not
selected
as
the
basis
for
mact
for
these
reasons
.
it
should
be
noted
,
however
,
that
a
portable
enclosure
that
will
contain
particulate
and
voc
during
abrasive
blasting
and
coating
of
ships
'
hulls
is
under
commercial
development
.
should
these
enclosures
prove
technically
and
economically
feasible
,
their
performance
should
be
considered
by
any
state
or
the
federal
government
in
developing
future
rules
for
this
industry
.
two
types
of
coating
operations
at
shipyards
where
emissions
are
more
available
to
capture
were
examined
more
closely
for
the
feasibility
of
addon
add
on
controls
:
indoor
coating
operations
and
painting
inside
of
ships
tanks
or
other
internal
enclosed
spaces
.
based
on
a
brief
screening
analyses
,
using
the
limited
available
data
that
assumes
all
spray
areas
are
continually
drafted
to
the
control
device
(
whether
painting
operations
are
underway
in
all
areas
or
not
,
addon
add
on
control
was
estimated
to
be
on
the
order
of
$
150000/mg
of
vohap
removed
.
the
epa
believes
that
this
cost
is
not
reasonable
for
this
source
category
.
as
a
result
,
addon
add
on
controls
were
not
investigated
further
nor
selected
as
the
basis
for
mact
.
in
reality
,
the
amount
of
voc
and
hap
controlled
at
a
site
is
dependent
on
the
rate
of
paint
application
,
the
concentration
of
these
compounds
in
the
exhaust
air
stream
during
the
painting
operation
,
the
flow
rate
of
the
air
stream
flowing
into
the
addon
add
on
control
unit
and
a
host
of
other
factors
.
the
suitability
of
addon
add
on
controls
can
only
be
determined
on
a
casebycase
case
by
case
basis
.
after
review
of
alternatives
more
stringent
than
the
mact
floor
,
the
epa
is
proposing
to
set
the
mact
standard
at
the
floor
based
on
the
california
marine
coatings
rule
which
is
for
both
new
and
existing
sources
.
the
costs
of
the
control
option
for
new
and
existing
sources
is
expected
to
be
the
same
.
the
agency
solicits
comments
on
this
determination
.
`
models
'
of
shipyards
were
developed
to
help
determine
the
need
to
differentiate
among
classes
of
shipyards
in
identifying
the
mact
'
models
were
developed
for
classes
of
yards
based
on
market
segment
(
yards
that
construct
ships
versus
those
that
only
repair
)
and
size
(
large
versus
medium
.
the
epa
concluded
there
is
no
basis
for
differentiating
among
classes
of
major
source
shipyards
,
but
specifically
solicits
comments
on
whether
this
category
should
be
subcategorized

handling
,
transfer
,
and
storage
of
vohap
containing
material
based
on
information
received
from
industry
,
a
variety
of
`
work
practice
'
measures
are
used
to
reduce
evaporative
losses
of
voc
from
transfer
,
handling
,
and
storage
of
solvent
and
paint
wastes
.
these
include
spill
minimization
techniques
(
use
of
spouts
,
funnels
,
or
catch
basins
during
transfer
of
liquids
from
one
container
to
another
,
the
use
of
normally
closed
containers
or
piping
to
transport
liquids
,
and
the
use
of
closefitting
close
fitting
or
tight
covers
on
containers
for
solvent
,
wet
rags
,
and
waste
.
many
more
than
five
facilities
employ
some
type
of
work
practice
measures
.
facilities
in
california
are
subject
to
regulations
to
minimize
evaporative
emissions
;
other
facilities
employ
such
measures
to
decrease
solvent
usage
or
to
minimize
exposure
of
workers
.
however
,
data
to
quantify
accurately
the
emission
reductions
achievable
by
different
work
practice
measures
is
unavailable
.
the
beneficial
effect
of
a
specific
change
is
largely
a
function
of
the
previous
plant
practice
being
remedied
.
as
a
result
,
even
though
such
activities
obviously
reduce
emissions
,
there
is
no
way
to
distinguish
between
the
`
best
controlled
source
'
and
the
`
best
performing
five
existing
sources
'
therefore
,
the
epa
has
designated
the
same
select
work
practice
measures
as
the
mact
floor
for
control
of
emissions
from
handling
and
transfer
of
vohap
containing
material
at
both
new
and
existing
facilities
.
for
emissions
from
storage
containers
,
the
mact
floor
is
use
of
tightfitting
tight
fitting
covers
that
must
be
normally
closed
;
that
is
,
in
place
except
when
materials
are
being
added
to
or
withdrawn
.
the
agency
believes
that
this
is
a
reasonable
approach
.
because
work
practice
measures
typically
entail
negligible
cost
,
any
emission
reduction
that
is
achieved
is
believed
to
be
worthwhile
.
the
epa
specifically
solicits
comments
on
this
determination
