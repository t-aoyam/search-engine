in
response
,
the
secretary
argues
that
hudson
applies
only
to
cases
remanded
pursuant
to
sentence
six
of
section
405g
,
where
there
is
no
final
judgment
and
the
clock
does
not
begin
to
run
.
the
difficulty
with
that
,
schaefer
contends
,
is
that
hudson
itself
clearly
involved
a
sentencefour
sentence

remand
.
on
the
last
point
,
schaefer
is
right
.
given
the
facts
recited
by
the
court
in
hudson
,
,
the
remand
order
there
could
have
been
authorized
only
under
sentence
four

however
,
the
facts
in
hudson
also
show
that
the
district
court
had
not
terminated
the
case
,
but
had
retained
jurisdiction
during
the
remand
.
and
that
was
a
central
element
in
our
decision
,
as
the
penultimate
sentence
of
the
opinion
shows
:
we
conclude
that
where
a
court
orders
a
remand
to
the
secretary
in
a
benefits
litigation
and
retains
continuing
jurisdiction
over
the
case
pending
a
decision
from
the
secretary
which
will
determine
the
claimants
entitlement
to
benefits
,
the
proceedings
on
remand
are
an
integral
part
of
the
`
civil
action
'
for
judicial
review
,
and
thus
attorneys
fees
for
representation
on
remand
are
available
subject
to
the
other
limitations
in
the
eaja
