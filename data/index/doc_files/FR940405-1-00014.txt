the
fdics
board
of
directors
has
concluded
that
the
proposed
amendment
,
if
adopted
,
will
not
impose
a
significant
economic
hardship
on
small
institutions
.
the
proposal
does
not
establish
any
recordkeeping
or
reporting
requirements
that
necessitate
the
expertise
of
specialized
accountants
,
lawyers
or
managers
.
the
proposal
would
,
in
fact
,
reduce
the
reporting
requirements
to
which
banks
are
presently
subject
.
rescinding
the
rapid
growth
rule
will
afford
some
insured
banks
the
opportunity
to
conduct
activities
previously
prohibited
unless
notice
were
given
in
accordance
with
the
rule
(
for
instance
,
the
solicitation
of
fully
insured
deposits
outside
a
banks
normal
trade
area
,
or
the
acquisition
of
secured
borrowings
,
including
repurchase
agreements
,
such
that
one
or
a
combination
of
both
activities
were
designed
to
increase
the
banks
assets
by
more
than
75
percent
during
any
consecutive
threemonth

period

the
fdics
board
of
directors
therefore
certifies
pursuant
to
section
605
of
the
regulatory
flexibility

(

)
that
the
proposal
,
if
adopted
,
will
not
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
