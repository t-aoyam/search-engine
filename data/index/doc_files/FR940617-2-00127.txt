in

of
the
increasingly
diverse

refugee

will
need

to
a
changing
ethnic
population

to
the
maximum
extent

during

refugee
social

when

believes

coalitionbuilding

section

of
the

provides
that
:
the

this

the

the

with

for

the

does
not
contain
provisions
for
the
allocation
of
additional
social

funds
beyond
the
amounts
established
in

.
therefore
a
state
which
may
wish
to
consider
carrying
out
such
a
project
should
take
note
of
this
in
planning
its
use

being
allocated
under
