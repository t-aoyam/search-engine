light
light
is
electromagnetic
energy
.
it
travels
from
its
source
in
packets
called
quanta
.
it
is
instructive
to
consider
light
as
a
plane
wave
.
the
light
has
a
direction
of
travel
.
perpendicular
to
this
and
mutually
perpendicular
to
each
other
,
are
two
vector
components
.
one
is
the
magnetic
vector
and
the
other
is
the
electric
vector
.
we
shall
only
be
concerned
with
the
electric
vector
.
in
this
description
,
the
interaction
of
the
vector
and
the
mineral
will
describe
all
the
observable
phenomena
.
from
a
light
source
such
a
microscope
illuminator
,
light
travels
in
all
different
direction
from
the
filament
.
in
any
given
direction
away
from
the
filament
,
the
electric
vector
is
perpendicular
to
the
direction
of
travel
of
a
light
ray
.
while
perpendicular
,
its
orientation
is
random
about
the
travel
axis
.
if
the
electric
vectors
from
all
the
light
rays
were
lined
up
by
passing
the
light
through
a
filter
that
would
only
let
light
rays
with
electric
vectors
oriented
in
one
direction
pass
,
the
light
would
then
be
polarized
.
.
polarized
light
interacts
with
matter
in
the
direction
of
the
electric
vector
.
this
is
the
polarization
direction
.
using
this
property
it
is
possible
to
use
polarized
light
to
probe
different
materials
and
identify
them
by
how
they
interact
with
light
.
the
speed
of
light
in
a
vacuum
is
a
constant
at
about
2
99
m
s
.
when
light
travels
in
different
materials
such
as
air
,
water
,
minerals
or
oil
,
it
does
not
travel
at
this
speed
.
it
travels
slower
.
this
slowing
is
a
function
of
both
the
material
through
which
the
light
is
traveling
and
the
wavelength
or
frequency
of
the
light
.
in
general
,
the
more
dense
the
material
,
the
slower
the
light
travels
.
also
,
generally
,
the
higher
the
frequency
,
the
slower
the
light
will
travel
.
the
ratio
of
the
speed
of
light
in
a
vacuum
to
that
in
a
material
is
called
the
index
of
refraction
(
n
.
it
is
usually
measured
at
589
nm
(
the
sodium
d
line
.
if
white
light
(
light
containing
all
the
visible
wavelengths
)
travels
through
a
material
,
rays
of
longer
wavelengths
will
travel
faster
than
those
of
shorter
wavelengths
,
this
separation
is
called
dispersion
.
dispersion
is
used
as
an
identifier
of
materials
as
described
in
section
46
.
42
.
material
properties
materials
are
either
amorphous
or
crystalline
.
the
difference
between
these
two
descriptions
depends
on
the
positions
of
the
atoms
in
them
.
the
atoms
in
amorphous
materials
are
randomly
arranged
with
no
long
range
order
.
an
example
of
an
amorphous
material
is
glass
.
the
atoms
in
crystalline
materials
,
on
the
other
hand
,
are
in
regular
arrays
and
have
long
range
order
.
most
of
the
atoms
can
be
found
in
highly
predictable
locations
.
examples
of
crystalline
material
are
salt
,
gold
,
and
the
asbestos
minerals
.
it
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
method
to
describe
the
different
types
of
crystalline
materials
that
can
be
found
,
or
the
full
description
of
the
classes
into
which
they
can
fall
.
however
,
some
general
crystallography
is
provided
below
to
give
a
foundation
to
the
procedures
described
.
with
the
exception
of
anthophyllite
,
all
the
asbestos
minerals
belong
to
the
monoclinic
crystal
type
.
the
unit
cell
is
the
basic
repeating
unit
of
the
crystal
and
for
monoclinic
crystals
can
be
described
as
having
three
unequal
sides
,
two
90
&
cir
;
angles
and
one
angle
not
equal
to
90
&
cir
.
the
orthorhombic
group
,
of
which
anthophyllite
is
a
member
has
three
unequal
sides
and
three
90
&
cir
;
angles
.
the
unequal
sides
are
a
consequence
of
the
complexity
of
fitting
the
different
atoms
into
the
unit
cell
.
although
the
atoms
are
in
a
regular
array
,
that
array
is
not
symmetrical
in
all
directions
.
there
is
long
range
order
in
the
three
major
directions
of
the
crystal
.
however
,
the
order
is
different
in
each
of
the
three
directions
.
this
has
the
effect
that
the
index
of
refraction
is
different
in
each
of
the
three
directions
.
using
polarized
light
,
we
can
investigate
the
index
of
refraction
in
each
of
the
directions
and
identify
the
mineral
or
material
under
investigation
.
the
indices
,
,
,
,
and
are
used
to
identify
the
lowest
,
middle
,
and
highest
index
of
refraction
respectively
.
the
x
direction
,
associated
with
is
called
the
fast
axis
.
conversely
,
the
z
direction
is
associated
with
and
is
the
slow
direction
.
crocidolite
has

the
fiber
length

it
`

.
the
remainder
of
the
asbestos
minerals
have
the
axis
along
the
fiber
length
.
they
are
called
`

.
this
orientation
to
fiber
length
is
used
to
aid
in
the
identification
of

.

polarized
light
technique
polarized
light
microscopy
as
described
in
this
section
uses
the
phasepolar
phase
polar
microscope
described
in
section
32
.
a
phase
contrast
microscope
is
fitted
with
two
polarizing
elements
,
one
below
and
one
above
the
sample
.
the
polarizers
have
their
polarization
directions
at
right
angles
to
each
other
.
depending
on
the
tests
performed
,
there
may
be
a
compensator
between
these
two
polarizing
elements
.
a
compensator
is
a
piece
of
mineral
with
known
properties
that
`
compensates
'
for
some
deficiency
in
the
optical
train
.
light
emerging
from
a
polarizing
element
has
its
electric
vector
pointing
in
the
polarization
direction
of
the
element
.
the
light
will
not
be
subsequently
transmitted
through
a
second
element
set
at
a
right
angle
to
the
first
element
.
unless
the
light
is
altered
as
it
passes
from
one
element
to
the
other
,
there
is
no
transmission
of
light
