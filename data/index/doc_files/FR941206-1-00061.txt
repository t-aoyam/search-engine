directs
the
agency
to
use
this
pollutant
list
to
develop
and
publish
a
list
of
source
categories
for
which
neshap
will
be
developed
;
this
list
was
published
in
the
federal

on

the

must
list
all
known
categories
and
subcategories
of
`
major
sources
'
that
emit
one
or
more
of
the
listed
hap
.
a
major
source
is
defined
in
section

as
any
stationary
source
or
group
of
stationary
sources
located
within
a
contiguous
area

under

criteria
for
development
of
neshap
the
neshap
are
to
be
developed
to
control
hap
emissions
from
both
new
and
existing
sources
according
to
the
statutory
directives
set
out
in
section
112d
)
of
the
act
.
the
statute
requires
the
standards
to
reflect
the
maximum
degree
of
reduction
in
emissions
of
hap
that
is
achievable
for
new
and
existing
sources
.
this
control
level
is
referred
to
as
the
`
maximum
achievable
control
technology
'
(
mact
.
the
selection
of
mact
must
reflect
consideration
of
the
cost
of
achieving
the
emission
reduction
,
any
nonair
quality
health
and
environmental
impacts
,
and
energy
requirements
for
control
levels
more
stringent
than
the
mact
floors
.
the
mact
floor
is
the
least
stringent
level
for
mact
standards
.
for
new
sources
,
the
standards
for
a
source
category
or
subcategory
`
shall
not
be
less
stringent
than
the
emission
control
that
is
achieved
in
practice
by
the
best
controlled
similar
source
,
as
determined
by
the
administrator
'
[
section
112d3
.
existing
source
standards
should
be
no
less
stringent
than
the
average
emission
limitation
achieved
by
the
best
performing
12
percent
of
the
existing
sources
for
categories
and
subcategories
with
30
or
more
sources
or
the
best
performing
5
sources
for
categories
or
subcategories
with
fewer
than
30
sources

although
neshap
are
normally
structured
in
terms
of
numerical
emission
limits
,
alternative
approaches
are
sometimes
necessary
.
in
some
cases
,
physically
measuring
emissions
from
a
source
may
be
impossible
or
at
least
impracticable
because
of
technological
and
economic
limitations
.

authorizes
the
administrator
to
promulgate
a

,
or
operational
standard

or
combination
thereof

in
those
cases
where
it
is
not
feasible
to

selection
of
pollutants
the
specific
pollutants
regulated
by
the
proposed
standards
are
those
compounds
that
are
listed
as
hap
in
section
112b
)
of
the
act
.
in
the
wood

(
surface
coating

source
category
,
hap
are
emitted
from
finishing
,
gluing
,
cleaning
,
and
washoff
operations
.
the
hap
most
commonly
used
by
the
wood
furniture
industry
are
vocs
used
as
solvents
in
the
finishing
materials
and
include
toluene
,
xylenes
,
methanol
,
methyl
ethyl
ketone
(
mek
,
and
methyl
isobutyl
ketone
(
mibk
.
another
material
used
in
finishing
operations
in
this
industry
is
thinner
,
which
is
used
to
dilute
finishing
materials
purchased
from
an
outside
source
.
thinners
contain
one
or
several
of
the
hap
previously
noted
and
,
therefore
,
are
a
source
of
hap
emissions
.
nonvolatile
hap
that
are
contained
in
the
finishing
materials
used
by
wood
furniture
manufacturers
are
typically
in
the
pigments
and
include
chromium
,
cobalt
,
and
manganese
.
