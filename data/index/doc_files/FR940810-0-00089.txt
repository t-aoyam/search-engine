osha
believes
that
some
of
these
potential
problems
attributable
to
negative
pressure
enclosures
may
be
averted
.
however
,
the
record
also
indicates
that
the
use
of
this
control
technique
shares
with
other
asbestos
control
methods
,
a
primary
reliance
upon
the
skill
and
training
of
designers
and
workers
to
assure
its
effectiveness
.
in
addition
,
under
some
circumstances
even
the
proper
use
of
negative
pressure
enclosures
can
introduce
additional
hazards
into
the
workplace
.
one
feature
of
some
negative
pressure
enclosure
systems
,
negative
air
ventilation
,
was
singled
out
by
some
participants
as
the
primary
means
of
reducing
exposures
to
employees
working
within
them
.
osha
notes
however
,
that
the
requirement
for
npes
as
adopted
in
the
1986
rule
,
did
not
contain
any
criteria
for
such
ventilation
,
and
that
the
rationale
for
requiring
npes
did
not
rest
on
the
capability
of
ventilation
to
reduce
employee
exposure
.
therefore
,
osha
regards
the
recommendation
for
requiring
special
ventilation
as
a
new
claim
,
to
be
supported
by
evidence
and
testimony
submitted
to
this
record
.
one
of
the
main
characteristics
of
the
negative
pressure
enclosure
system
is
that
the
air
pressure
inside
the
enclosure
is
less
than
outside
the
enclosure
.
this
pressure
difference
is
created
by
a
fan
exhausting
air
,
through
a
filter
,
from
inside
the
enclosure
to
outside
the
enclosure
.
under
negative
pressure
,
any
leaks
in
the
walls
of
the
enclosure
will
result
in
clean
air
coming
into
the
enclosure
,
rather
than
contaminated
air
leaking
to
the
outside
.
the
system
is
primarily
designed
to
keep
asbestos
from
contaminating
the
building
.
as
stated
earlier
,
this
approach
does
not
appear
to
improve
working
conditions
inside
the
enclosure
.
negative
air
ventilation
draws
clean
air
from
outside
the
enclosure
at
sufficient
quantities
and
at
strategic
locations
,
so
as
to
provide
clean
air
in
the
workers
breathing
zone
.
support
for
negative
air
ventilation
was
submitted
by
numerous
participants
.
for
example
,
mr
.
dangelo
testified
that
`
negative
air
ventilation
is
the
single
most
effective
engineering
control
reducing
worker
exposure
as
well
as
reducing
the
risk
to
adjacent
bystanders
or
other
operations
'
further
,
he
recommended
a
minimum
of
8
and
up
to
20
air
changes
per
hour
to
assure
appropriate
ventilation
is
maintained

this
process
,
`
which
has
expanded
on
the
negative
pressure
enclosure
,
(
is
)
called
air
flush
methodology
'
(

.

.
other
participants
also
supported
the
use
of
`
air
flushing
'
techniques
,
or

makeup
make
air
.
chip
dangelo
,
an
asbestos
abatement
consultant
described
the
principle
as
moving
airborne
fibers
out
of
the
work
area
with
air
velocity
,
thereby
`
flushing
'
the
area
by
bringing
in
air
from
sources
outside
the
enclosure
additional
to
that
brought
through
the
decontamination
chamber
.
he
further
described
moving
the
air
away
from
the
worker
and
toward
the
negative
air
filtration
machines
and
directing
the
moving
air
to
`
dead
spots
'
in
the
enclosure
by
use
of
baffles
and
flexiducts

mr

,
president
of

suggested
adding
to
the
definition
of

enclosure
,
the
phrase
`

that

that

although
`
air
flushing
'
is
the
ventilation
approach
most
recommended
for
use
within
negative
pressure
systems
,
actual
data
showing
its
success
is
limited
.
in
recognition
of
the
support
from
engineers
who
have
utilized
these
systems
,
osha
is
requiring
a
performance
based
version
of
`
air
flushing
'
as
a
component
of
the
negative
pressure
enclosure
system
.
osha
is
also
requiring
ventilation

`
directs
the
air

exposed
employees

when
other
controls
are
used
for

where
no
there
is
insufficient

'
participants
also
argued
that
the
use
of
negative
pressure
systems
under
stated
circumstances
was
unnecessary
and
would
not
contribute
to
employee
protection
against
asbestos
exposure
.
working

was
one
such
circumstance

submitted

95

indicated
very

however
,
the
following
work
practices
were
also
used
:

use
of
