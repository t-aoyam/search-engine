the

which
include
among
their
objectives
the
identification
of

for

in

fsis
is
proposing
to
require
that
meat
derived
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
recovery
systems
be
produced
under
an
approved
quality

program
.
fsis
believes
quality
control
is
necessary
to
assure
that
establishments
manufacture
meat
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
recovery
systems
that
complies
with
the
provisions
of
the
proposed
amendment
of
the
definition
of
meat
.
utilization
of
such
a
quality
control
program
in
producing
this
product
would
be
prerequisite
for
the
approval
of
labels
for
products
consisting
of
or
containing
meat
from
advanced
recovery
systems
.
in
other
words
,
an
approved
quality
control
program
would
be
necessary
prior
to
the
production
of
meat
using
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
recovery
systems
.
the
function
of
a
quality
control
program
would
be
to
restrict
potential
deviations
from
the
prescribed
definition
of
meat
by
controlling
the
factors
that
can
affect
conformance
with
the
definition
.
thus
,
it
is
proposed
to
require
that
the
quality
control
program
provide
the
controls
and
information
necessary
to
assure
that
the
meat
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
and
recovery
systems
will
meet
each
of
the
requirements
of
the
regulations
and
will
enable
establishment
personnel
and
fsis
to
monitor
it
for
effectiveness
.
fsis
is
focusing
on
methods
that
will
maintain
the
uniformity
of
starting
materials
and
control
the
handling
and
processing
of
starting
materials
and
resulting
product
.
the
methods
of
analysis
for
calcium
and
protein
quality
that
are
permitted
and
are
intended
to
be
used
should
be
identified
in
the
quality
control
system
.
under
the
proposal
,
the
owner
or
operator
of
an
establishment
that
intends
to
manufacture
meat
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
recovery
systems
would
request
the
administrator
of
fsis
to
approve
the
establishments
quality
control
program
.
the
procedures
and
criteria
for
receiving
such
requests
and
assessing
the
adequacy
of
programs
for
quality
control
,
as
well
as
for
terminating
approval
,
would
be
those
set
forth
in
9
cfr
3184
.
these
provisions
provide
guidance
on
the
development
and
maintenance
of
appropriate
quality
control
programs
.
fsis
believes
that
with
a
quality
control
approach
to
preventing
noncompliance
from
occurring
,
the
need
for
testing
the
resulting
product
to
assure
compliance
can
be
reduced
and
,
consequently
,
the
costs
of
production
kept
down
.
moreover
,
the
proposed
quality
control
requirement
builds
on
the
control
and
information
programs
that
processors
use
to
predict
and
minimize
the
likelihood
of
manufacturing
products
that
are
inconsistent
and
of
varying
quality
,
and
do
not
comply
with
regulatory
requirements
.
proposing
to
rely
on
a
approved
quality
control
program
,
rather
than
continual
testing
by
processors
,
is
a
means
for
assuring
that
operations
achieve
compliance
with
the
applicable
proposed
requirements
and
,
thereby
,
prevents
misbranding
and
adulteration
of
the
resulting
meat
.
the
goal
of
preventing
misbranding
and
adulteration
are
key
issues
with
regard
to
meat
products
produced
by
mechanical
meat
bone
separation
,
and
can
be
achieved
effectively
and
efficiently
where
a
program
for
quality
control
incorporates
appropriate
methods
and
monitoring
techniques
,
and
adheres
to
good
manufacturing
practices
.
fsis
believes
that
product
exceeding
the
calcium
limit
should
not
be
classified
as
meat
because
if
it
exceeds
the
proposed
calcium
limits
,
it
would
reflect
unacceptable
incorporation
of
bone
in
the
product
during
processing
.
to
ensure
that
product
satisfies
the
calcium
requirement
,
fsis
is
proposing
that
a
sample
of
at
least
one
pound
from
each
lot
of
production
would
be
taken
and
analyzed
for
calcium
.
a
lot
would
consist
of
the
meat
derived
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
recovery
systems
,
designated
as
such
by
the
operator
of
the
establishment
or
his
or
her
agent
,
from
the
product
produced
from
a
single
species
of
livestock
in
no
more
than
one
continuous
shift
of
up
to
12
hours
.
the
results
from
chemical
analyses
would
be
compared
to
the
requirement
of
150
mg/100
gm
of
product
within
a
tolerance
of
0
03
percent
or
30
mg
.
if
statistical
evidence
exists
that
product
may
not
be
in
compliance
,
then
further
sampling
of
the
product
will
be
required
to
demonstrate
that
the
product
is
in
compliance
with
requirements
for
meat
derived
from
meat
bone
separation
and
recovery
systems
.
it
is
proposed
that
statistical
evidence
of
noncompliance
compliance
exists
when
an
individual
analytical
result
is
more
than
0
03
percent
(
ie
,
30
mg
)
above
the
requirement
,
ie
,
greater
than
0
18
percent
(
ie
,
180
mg
.
(
this
tolerance
is
derived
by
equating
it
to
three
times
the
expected
standard
deviation
(
ie
,
01
percent
)
of
the
analytical
procedure
used
by
fsis
to
measure
the
calcium
contents
in
