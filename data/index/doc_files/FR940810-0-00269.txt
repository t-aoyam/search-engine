toxicology
clinical
evidence
of
the
adverse
effects
associated
with
exposure
to
asbestos
is
present
in
the
form
of
several
well
-
conducted
epidemiological
studies
of
occupationally
exposed
workers
,
family
contacts
of
workers
,
and
persons
living
near
asbestos
mines
.
these
studies
have
shown
a
definite
association
between
exposure
to
asbestos
and
an
increased
incidence
of
lung
cancer
,
pleural
and
peritoneal
mesothelioma
,
gastrointestinal
cancer
,
and
asbestosis
.
the
latter
is
a
disabling
fibrotic
lung
disease
that
is
caused
only
by
exposure
to
asbestos
.
exposure
to
asbestos
has
also
been
associated
with
an
increased
incidence
of
esophageal
,
kidney
,
laryngeal
,
pharyngeal
,
and
buccal
cavity
cancers
.
as
with
other
known
chronic
occupational
diseases
,
disease
associated
with
asbestos
generally
appears
about
20
years
following
the
first
occurrence
of
exposure
:
there
are
no
known
acute
effects
associated
with
exposure
to
asbestos
.
epidemiological
studies
indicate
that
the
risk
of
lung
cancer
among
exposed
workers
who
smoke
cigarettes
is
greatly
increased
over
the
risk
of
lung
cancer
among
nonexposed
exposed
smokers
or
exposed
nonsmokers
.
these
studies
suggest
that
cessation
of
smoking
will
reduce
the
risk
of
lung
cancer
for
a
person
exposed
to
asbestos
but
will
not
reduce
it
to
the
same
level
of
risk
as
that
existing
for
an
exposed
worker
who
has
never
smoked
.
iii
.
signs
and
symptoms
of
exposure
related
disease
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
lung
cancer
or
gastrointestinal
cancer
induced
by
exposure
to
asbestos
are
not
unique
,
except
that
a
chest
xray
x
ray
of
an
exposed
patient
with
lung
cancer
may
show
pleural
plaques
,
pleural
calcification
,
or
pleural
fibrosis
.
symptoms
characteristic
of
mesothelioma
include
shortness
of
breath
,
pain
in
the
walls
of
the
chest
,
or
abdominal
pain
.
mesothelioma
has
a
much
longer
latency
period
compared
with
lung
cancer
(
40
years
versus
1520
years
,
and
mesothelioma
is
therefore
more
likely
to
be
found
among
workers
who
were
first
exposed
to
asbestos
at
an
early
age
.
mesothelioma
is
always
fatal
.
asbestosis
is
pulmonary
fibrosis
caused
by
the
accumulation
of
asbestos
fibers
in
the
lungs
.
symptoms
include
shortness
of
breath
,
coughing
,
fatigue
,
and
vague
feelings
of
sickness
.
when
the
fibrosis
worsens
,
shortness
of
breath
occurs
even
at
rest
.
the
diagnosis
of
asbestosis
is
based
on
a
history
of
exposure
to
asbestos
,
the
presence
of
characteristics
radiologic
changes
,
endinspiratory
end
inspiratory
crackles
(
rales
,
and
other
clinical
features
of
fibrosing
lung
disease
.
pleural
plaques
and
thickening
are
observed
on
xrays
x
rays
taken
during
the
early
sates
of
the
disease
.
asbestosis
is
often
a
progressive
disease
even
in
the
absence
of
continued
exposure
,
although
this
appears
to
be
a
highly
individualized
characteristic
.
in
severe
cases
,
death
may
be
caused
by
respiratory
or
cardiac
failure
.
iv
.
surveillance
and
preventive
considerations
as
noted
above
,
exposure
to
asbestos
have
been
linked
to
an
increased
risk
of
lung
cancer
,
mesothelioma
,
gastrointestinal
cancer
,
and
asbestosis
among
occupationally
exposed
workers
.
adequate
screening
tests
to
determine
an
employees
potential
for
developing
serious
chronic
diseases
,
such
as
a
cancer
,
from
exposure
to
asbestos
do
not
presently
exist
.
however
,
some
tests
,
particularly
chest
xrays
x
rays
and
pulmonary
function
tests
,
may
indicate
that
an
employee
has
been
overexposed
to
asbestos
increasing
his
or
her
risk
of
developing
exposure
related
chronic
diseases
.
it
is
important
for
the
physician
to
become
familiar
with
the
operating
conditions
in
which
occupational
exposure
to
asbestos
is
likely
to
occur
.
this
is
particularly
important
in
evaluating
medical
and
work
histories
and
in
conducting
physical
examinations
.
when
an
active
employee
has
been
identified
as
having
been
overexposed
to
asbestos
measures
taken
by
the
employer
to
eliminate
or
mitigate
further
exposure
should
also
lower
the
risk
of
serious
longterm
long
term
consequences
.
