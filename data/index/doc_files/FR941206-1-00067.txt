the
agency
proposes
that
mact
for
contact
adhesives
should
also
be
set
at
the
same
level
as
the
mact
floor
.
(
the
committee
was
not
involved
in
selecting
mact
for
gluing
operations
)
based
upon
discussions
with
industry
,
the
agency
decided
that
an
emission
limitation
more
stringent
than
the
mact
floor
was
not
feasible
for
contact
adhesives
.
the
agency
proposes
that
mact
for
contact
adhesives
used
for
upholstery
operations
(
referred
to
here
as
foam
adhesives
)
be
set
at
a
different

many
of
the
products
manufactured
with
foam
adhesives
must
meet
standards
for
flammability
.
however
,
industry
,
including
furniture
manufacturers
and
adhesive
suppliers
,
have
stated
that
products
manufactured
with
waterborne
foam
adhesives
may
fail
these
flammability
tests
.
therefore
,
the
epa
has
decided
that
foam
adhesives
used
in
products
manufactured
by
existing
sources
that
meet
the
flammability
standards
do
not
have
to
meet
the

for
foam
adhesives
used
in
products
manufactured
by
existing
sources
that
do
not
meet
the
flammability
standards
,
the
epa
is
proposing
that
mact
for
existing

be
set
at

,
that
is
,
1

(

as

the
agency
believes
that
hap
emissions
from
foam
adhesives
used
in
products
manufactured
by
existing
sources
can
be
reduced
.
in
order
to
establish
a
limit
for
these
adhesives
,
the
epa
elected
to
set
a
limit
equivalent
to
that
of
the
lowest
emitting
solventborne
foam
adhesive
used
in
quantities
greater
than
200
gallons
per
year
.
this
adhesive
has
a
hap
content
of
18

therefore
,
the
epa
is
proposing

some

these

not

.
manufacturers
have
also
requested
an
exemption
for
aerosol
adhesives
.
these
adhesives
are
typically
used
by
small
businesses
and
by
larger
businesses
for
touchup
touch
and
repair
.
according
to
manufacturers
,
they
are
highly
specialized
systems
and
reformulation
involves
complex
problems
that
affect
not
only
the
adhesive
but
the
delivery
system
as
well
.
rather
than
allow
the
exemptions
at
this
time
,
the
agency
has
decided
to
request
comment
on
whether
the
exemptions
should
be
allowed
and
any
data
that
would
support
or
refute
the
need
for
these
exemptions
.
additionally
,
the
agency
specifically
requests
comments
on
the
approach
used
for
establishing
mact
for
contact
adhesives
for
existing
sources
including
comment
on
the
following
issues
:

the
appropriateness
