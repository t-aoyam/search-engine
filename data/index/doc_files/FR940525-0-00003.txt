the
purpose
of
the
rfa
is
to
fit
regulatory
actions
to
the
scale
of
business
subject
to
such
actions
in
order
that
small
businesses
will
not
be
unduly
or
disproportionately
burdened
.
marketing
orders
issued
pursuant
to
the
act
,
and
rules
issued
thereunder
,
are
unique
in
that
they
are
brought
about
through
group
action
of
essentially
small
entities
acting
on
their
own
behalf
.
thus
,
both
statutes
have
small
entity
orientation
and
compatibility
.
there
are
about
100
florida
citrus
handlers
subject
to
regulation
under
the
marketing
order
covering
oranges
,
grapefruit
,
tangerines
,
and
tangelos
grown
in
florida
,
and
about
11000
growers
of
these
citrus
fruits
in
florida
.
small
agricultural
service
firms
have
been
defined
by
the
small
business
administration
(
13
cfr
121
601
)
as
those
having
annual
receipts
of
less
than
$
5000000
,
and
small
agricultural
growers
are
defined
as
those
whose
annual
receipts
are
less
than
$
500000
.
a
minority
of
these
handlers
and
a
majority
of
the
growers
may
be
classified
as
small
entities
.
the
marketing
order
for
florida
citrus
provides
for
the
establishment
of
minimum
grade
and
size
requirements
.
the
minimum
grade
and
size
requirements
are
designed
to
provide
fresh
markets
with
fruit
of
acceptable
quality
,
thereby
maintaining
consumer
confidence
for
fresh
florida
citrus
.
this
helps
create
buyer
confidence
and
contributes
to
stable
marketing
conditions
.
this
is
in
the
interest
of
producers
,
packers
,
and
consumers
,
and
is
designed
to
increase
returns
to
florida
citrus
growers
.
the
cultural
practices
of
producers
of
organically
grown
citrus
differ
from
normal
industry
practices
.
because
of
these
differences
,
organically
grown
fruit
is
usually
required
to
meet
a
different
grade
standard
under
the
marketing
order
.
this
grade
standard
pertains
only
to
the
external
characteristics
of
the
fruit
,
not
the
internal
quality
.
the
different
grade
standard
is
needed
to
facilitate
the
marketing
of
organic
citrus
.
there
are
indications
that
organically
grown
citrus
,
from
a
marketing
standpoint
,
are
a
different
commodity
than
conventionally
grown
citrus
.
organic
citrus
generally
has
higher
external
damage
.
organic
fruit
for
the
most
part
is
marketed
differently
,
is
not
mixed
with
nonorganic
organic
fruit
,
appeals
only
to
certain
consumers
,
and
is
in
many
respects
,
a
specialized
commodity
.
this
action
invites
comments
on
changes
to
the
administrative
rules
and
regulations
prescribed
under
the
florida
citrus
marketing
order
.
this
rule
more
precisely
defines
organic
fruit
,
and
the
type
of
market
outlets
which
organically
grown
fruit
may
be
sold
in
,
free
from
certain
requirements
imposed
under
the
order
.
these
changes
were
unanimously
recommended
by
the
committee
at
its
11/16/1993
meeting
.
