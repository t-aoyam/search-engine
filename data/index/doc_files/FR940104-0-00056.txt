comments
regarding
risk
assessment
five
commenters
responded
to
the
risk
assessment
presented
in
the
proposed
rule
.
one
commenter
stated
that
the
epa
incorrectly
converted
units
of
measurement
in
the
record
sampling
data
used
for
the
risk
assessment
causing
the
overestimation
of
incremental
risk
for
the
fish
shellfish
consumption
and
soil
ingestion
pathways
by
a
1000fold
fold
.
the
epa
agrees
with
the
commenter
.
the
dioxin
concentrations
in
the
formulation
at
one
of
the
affected
facilities
(
aquasco
,
md
)
were
reported
in
the
wrong
units
,
causing
a
1000fold
fold
error
to
be
incorporated
into
the
risk
estimates
for
the
fish
and
shellfish
ingestion
and
soil
ingestion
scenarios
.
when
this
error
is
corrected
,

(

cross

from

)
and
used
in
the
lifetime
individual
risk
estimates
for
the
soil
ingestion
scenario
and
fish
and
shellfish
ingestion
scenario
were
reduced
by
a
1000fold
fold
.

the
estimated
risk
to
any
one
individual
using
the
corrected
values
are
1000fold
fold
lower
than
the
risk
estimated
in
the
proposed
rule
from

cross

due
to
past
use
.
in
this
case
for
the
typically
exposed
individual
in
the
general
population
,
the
incremental
risk
of
developing
cancer
is
a
chance
of
08
in

(

;
in
the

the
risk
of
developing

is
increased
by

.
the
estimated
incremental

is
also
reduced
,
after
correction
,
approximately
by
a
1000fold
fold
,
to
0

cases/70
years
for
the

increase
in
the

of

as
a
result
of

to

of

with

from
