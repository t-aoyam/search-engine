in
the
court
of
appeals
litigation
,
aia
challenged
oshas
use
of
the
pel
to
calculate
the
residual
risk
remaining
after
the
standard
is
implemented
.
aia
contended
that
workers
would
actually
be
exposed
to
average
levels
significantly
below
the
pel
because
employers
would
be
required
to
engineer
down
to
levels
well
below
the
pel
to
assure
that
random
fluctuations
would
not
result
in
an
osha
compliance
officer
measuring
an
exposure
level
over
the
pel
during
a
routine
inspection
.
therefore
,
aia
contended
,
in
calculating
residual
risk
,
osha
should
assume
that
employees
will
be
exposed
to
average
levels
that
are
between
onehalf
one
half
and
onequarter
one
quarter
of
the
pel
.
the
court
implied
that
such
an
argument
might
have
merit
if
factually
supported
and
suggested
that
osha
should
make
its
own
calculations
of
the
relation
between
permissible
exposure
limit
and
the
actual
exposures
such
a
limit
would
produce
.
(

at

)
having
carefully
considered
the
issue
,
osha
concludes
it
would
be
unrealistic
to
base
its
risk
assessment
on
the
assumption
that
employers
will
engineer
to
levels
significantly
below
the
pel
.
first
,
as
discussed
below
,
the
pel
of
01
f
cc
is
at
the
limit
of
feasibility
for
those
workplaces
in
which
asbestos
levels
are
most
difficult
to
control
,
and
an
assumption
that
average
exposures
will
be
substantially
below
the
pel
will
clearly
be
unrealistic
for
such
workplaces
.
second
,
osha
found
in
issuing
the
1986
standard
that
aias
argument
about
uncontrollable
fluctuations
was
exaggerated
because
such
fluctuations
could
be
minimized
through
proper
inspection
and
maintenance
of
engineering
controls
and
through
proper
training
and
supervision
of
employees
whose
work
practices
affected
exposure
levels
.

third
,
oshas
enforcement
policy
gives
employers
the
opportunity
to
show
that
a
compliance
officers
measurement
over
the
pel
is
unrepresentatively
high
and
does
not
justify
a
citation
,
thus
alleviating
any
concern
employers
might
have
that
they
will
be
cited
on
the
basis
of
a
single
measurement
that
results
from
uncontrollable
fluctuations
.
fourth
,
even
if
some
employers
are
sufficiently
riskaverse
risk
averse
to
engineer
down
to
well
below
the
pel
to
avoid
a
slight
risk
of
citation
,
osha
cannot
base
a
realistic
risk
assessment
on
the
assumption
that
most
employers
will
do
so
.
the
01
f
cc
level
leaves
a
remaining
significant
risk
.
however
as
discussed
below
,
and
in
earlier
documents
,
osha
believes
this
is
the
practical
lower
limit
of
feasibility
for
measuring
asbestos
levels
reliably
.
however
the
work
practices
and
engineering
controls
specified
below
for
specific
operations
and
required
respirator
use
will
in
oshas
view
further
reduce
the
risk
.
as
discussed
below
,
osha
has
carefully
reviewed
all
the
public
suggestions
to
further
reduce
significant
risk
and
has
adopted
those
which
have
merit
.
after
osha
has
determined
that
a
significant
risk
exists
and
that
such
risk
can
be
reduced
or
eliminated
by
the
proposed
standard
,
it
must
set
the
standard
`
which
most
adequately
assures
,
to
the
extent
feasible
on
the

of

the

has
interpreted
this
section
to
mean
that
osha
must
enact
the
most
protective
standard
necessary
to
eliminate
a

the

osha

explained
its
decisions
not
to
adopt
certain
regulatory
provisions
recommended
by
participants
in
that
rulemaking
.

the
court
of

held
that
it

the
court
noted
that
osha
need
not
justify
its
failure
to
adopt
all
suggested
provisions
:
rather
,
the
agency
must
defend
not
adopting

those

the

further
explained
,
`
naturally
the
force

evidence
