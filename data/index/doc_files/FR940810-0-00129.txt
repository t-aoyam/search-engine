that

reasons
for
this
were

as
:
oshas
earlier

are
inadequate
;
that
`
ahera
has
proved
successful
,

and
that

be
improved

as
noted
above
,
it
recently
issued
improved
model
curricula
,
increasing
the
training
requirements

in

,
the

contains
specific
`

training
requirements
in

including
those

epa
also
increased
the
number
of
training
hours
and
now
requires
4day
day
training

workers
,
and
5day
day
training
of
supervisors
.
other
disciplines
of
the
ahera
program
also
have
increased
training
requirements
.
osha
has
reviewed
recommendations
carefully
and
has
concluded
that
requiring
osha
to
certify
training
courses
and
trainers
would
consume
a
disproportionate
share
of
oshas
resources
.
further
,
establishing
another
system
for
certifying
asbestos
trainers
and
workers
when
another
agency
has
a
similar
program
in
place
would
be
duplicative
of
effort
as
well
.
oshas
concerns
regarding
duplication
of
effort
is
also
addressed

in

it
