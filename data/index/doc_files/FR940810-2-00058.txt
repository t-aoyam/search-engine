brom
70/30
is
a
fumigant
product
used
to
control
nematodes
and
soil
fungi
as
well
as
several
other
soilborne
soil
borne
pathogens
on
strawberries
,
tomatoes
,
seed
beds
,
and
floral
and
nursery
crops
.
this
product
contains
13dichloropropene
dichloropropene
and
methyl
bromide
,
and
epa
has
recently
taken
action
affecting
the
regulatory
status
of
both
of
these
active
ingredients
.
13dichloropropene
dichloropropene
is
registered
by
dowelanco
and
is
marketed
as
telone
and
telone
c17
.
in
addition
to
selling
telone
as
an
enduse
end
use
product
,
dowelanco
also
sells
telone
to
reformulators
such
as
soil
chemicals
corp
,
who
add
other
active
ingredients
for
specialized
pesticidal
needs
.
13dichloropropene
dichloropropene
was
placed
in
epas
special
review
in
1986
based
on
cancer
concerns
for
applicators
and
loaders
.
groundwater
contamination
and
possible
residues
in
food
were
also
noted
.
several
studies
were
required
through
the
pesticide
reregistration
program
to
further
define
human
exposure
and
potential
ground
water
contamination
.
on
10/07/1992
,
epa
and
dowelanco
entered
into
an
agreement
to
modify
the
registrations
and
labels
of
its
13dichloropropene
dichloropropene
products
to
reflect
riskreduction
risk
reduction
measures
.
the
risk
reduction
measures
were
sought
both
through
use
reduction
and
through
13dichloropropenespecific
dichloropropene
technology
to
reduce
the
amount
of
the
chemical
that
escapes
into
the
atmosphere
.
in
addition
,
timeframes
were
set
for
all
remaining
studies
,
and
dowelanco
revised
its
product
stewardship
program
to
reflect
the
label
changes
.
the
agreement
also
specified
that
a
clause
be
added
to
the
telone
labels
requiring
that
any
product
reformulated
from
or
containing
the
telone
product
bear
an
epaapproved
epa
approved
label
containing
all
of
the
required
changes
in
the
timeframes
specified
in
the
agreement
.
epa
sent
copies
of
the
agreement
to
all
registrants
of
products
containing
telone
with
instructions
as
to
how
and
when
to
respond
.
on
05/24/1993
,
soil
chemicals
corp
.
submitted
labels
for
the
first
label
changes
from
the
10/19/1992
agreement
,
which
were
to
take
effect
06/30/1993
.
soil
chemicals
corp
.
submitted
labels
for
its
13dichloropropene/chloropicrin
dichloropropene
products
,
as
well
as
the
brom
70/30
product
.
these
labels
were
rejected
because
new
uses
had
been
added
to
the
revised
labels
without
proper
compensation
agreements
,
as
well
as
for
other
deficiencies
.
soil
chemicals
corp
.
resubmitted
corrected
revised
labels
for
the
products
containing
13dichloropropene
dichloropropene
and
chloropicrin
,
but
none
for
brom
70/30
.
because
the
brom
70/30
label
does
not
contain
the
required
changes
for
13dichloropropene
dichloropropene
,
this
product
is
now
misbranded
under
fifra
section
12a1e
)
and
subject
to
enforcement
action
.
in
addition
,
epa
issued
its
final
regulation
for
the
worker
protection
standard
(
wps
)
on
08/21/1992
.
the
wps
provides
basic
information
and
protective
measures
for
all
persons
involved
in
the
handling
of
pesticides
both
during
and
after
application
.
epa
decided
to
issue
guidance
for
each
fumigant
separately
since
the
chemical
properties
,
and
thus
protective
requirements
,
of
each
fumigant
differ
greatly
.
due
to
13dichloropropenes
dichloropropene
small
molecular
size
and
high
volatility
,
epa
requires
tightfitting
tight
fitting
protection
,
such
as
respirators
,
gloves
,
and
facesealing
face
sealing
goggles
.
for
methyl
bromide
,
however
,
its
corrosivity
demands
loosefitting
loose
fitting
protective
clothing
.
if
tightfitting
tight
fitting
clothing
were
also
worn
during
methyl
bromide
use
,
the
trapped
chemical
could
cause
serious
skin
damage
.
because
of
the
conflicting
wps
requirements
and
noncompliance
with
the
label
requirements
arising
from
the
october
1992
agreement
,
epa
issued
a
letter
to
soil
chemicals
corp
.
on
03/07/1994
,
outlining
the
issues
as
discussed
above
,
and
explaining
regulatory
options
to
address
the
noncompliance
compliance
with
both
the
telone
label
and
the
wps
.
ii
.
request
for
voluntary
cancellation
in
a
letter
dated
03/21/1994
,
soil
chemicals
corp
.
requested
voluntary
cancellation
of
brom
70/30
.
the
company
noted
in
the
letter
that
it
had
not
sold
the
product
for
the
past
2
years
and
,
further
,
claimed
that
neither
the
company
nor
supplemental
distributors
have
any
product
under
their
custody
.
this
claim
is
supported
by
results
of
a
1990
data
callin
call
in
that
was
issued
to
collect
information
on
use
,
usage
,
and

noncompliance

that
standard
mandates
that
any
product
sold
after
april
21
,
1994
must
bear
language
from
the
wps
.
because
soil
chemicals

is
out
of
