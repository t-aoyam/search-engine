and

interpretation
.
the
purpose
of
the
interpretation
is
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
public
offering
system
by
ensuring
that
members
make
a
bona
fide
public
distribution
of
`
hot
issue
'
securities
and
do
not
withhold
such
securities
for
their
own
benefit
or
use
the
securities
to
reward
other
persons
who
are
in
a
position
to
direct
future
business
to
the
member
.
hot
issues
are
defined
by
the
interpretation
as
securities
of
a
public
offering
while
trade
at
a
premium
in
the
secondary
market
whenever
such
trading
commences
.
the
interpretation
prohibits
members
from
retaining
the
securities
of
hot
issues
in
their
own
accounts
and
prohibits
members
from
using
sales
of
such
securities
to
directors
,
officers
,
employees
and
associated
persons
of
members
and
other
broker
dealers
.
it
also
restricts
member

of
`

'
securities
to
the

of
specified
categories
of

advisory

and
other
persons
within
such
organizations
whose
activities
influence
or
include
the
buying
or

.
these
basic
prohibitions
and
restrictions
are
also
made
applicable
to
sales
by
members
of

to
accounts
in
which
any
such

may
have
a

,
the
board
of
governors
appointed
a
special
committee
(
the
`
committee
)
to
examine
the
interpretation
to
determine
if
the
interpretations
restrictions
,
definitions
and
obligations
are
relevant
in
todays
securities
markets
.
the
committee
was
comprised
of
representatives
of
the
associations

business

,
corporate
financing
and
insurance
affiliated
members
committees
as
well
as
members
of
the
nasd
board
of
governors
.
the
board
also
asked
the
committee
to
examine
various
interpretative
issues
that
had
been
raised
with
the
nasd
.
the
committee
met
numerous
times
from
05/19/1992
until
04/19/1993
and
received
input
and
suggestions
,
both
in
writing
and
in
person
,
from
members
,
issuers
,
law
firms
,
the
nasds
legal
advisory
board
,
and
the
staff
of
various
nasd
departments
.
in
06/19/1993
,
the
nasd
published
for
comment
proposed
modifications
to
the
interpretation
based
on
its
review
and
suggestions
received
.
the
nasd
received
36
comment
letters
on
the
proposed
modifications
.
the
committee
considered
the
comments
and
made
final
recommendations
to
the
national
business
conduct
committee
(
nbcc
)
in
11/19/1993
.
the
board
considered
and
approved
the
nbccs
recommendations
on
11/14/1993
.
the
proposed
rule
change
includes
language
clarifications
to
facilitate
understanding
of
the
interpretations
application
,
as
well
as
substantive
modifications
.
the
following
discusses
the
substantive
modifications
proposed
.
(
c
)
substantive
proposed
modifications
.
.
the
nasd
is
proposing
several
substantive
modifications
to
the
interpretation
,
including
changes
in
connection
with
limited
business
broker
dealers
,
investment
partnerships
and
corporations
,
standby
stand
by
arrangements
,
venture
capital
investors
,
securities
offerings
covered
by
the
interpretation
,
and
issuerdirected
issuer
directed
securities
.
the
nasd
believes
that
the
proposed
substantive
changes
clarify
the
scope
of
the
interpretation
and
remedy
certain
unintended
effects
the
interpretation
has
had
in
its
present
form
.
specifically
,
the
nasd
believes
that
the
interpretation
has
prohibited
transactions
which
do
not
implicate
the
interpretations
objective
of
a
bona
fide
distribution
of
hot
issue
securities
to
the
public
,
and
may
have
created
unduly
burdensome
restrictions
and
expense
for
nasd
members
and
their
customers
.
thus
,
the
nasd
believes
that
the
proposed
changes
,
described
further
below
,
appropriately
restrict
prohibited
persons
from
receiving
hot
issues
without
engendering
unintended
restrictions
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
interpretation
.
