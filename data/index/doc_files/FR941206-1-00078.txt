several
of
the
above
practices
were
not
proposed
by
the
committee
because
the
committee
believed
that
by
requiring
them
,
the
proposed
rule
would
be
dictating
specific
manufacturing
techniques
that
may
not
be
appropriate
for
all
situations
.
specifically
,
the
committee
believed
that
this
eliminated
options
2
,
4
,
6
,
7
,
8
,
9
,
and
10
.
also
,
options
such
as
2
,
4
,
8
,
9
,
and
10
are
cost
savings
techniques
that
would
likely
be
implemented
by
a
facility
if
they
were
technically
feasible
.
the
committee
decided
that
,
for
the
most
part
,
options
6
and
7
were
not
feasible
for
this
industry
because
the
manufacturing
schedule
is
highly
dependent
on
the
furniture
order
that
is
received
in
a
given
week
,
month
,
etc
.
manufacturers
that
consistently
produce
the
same
item
are
most
likely
using
these
more
efficient
techniques
.
options
1
and
11
would
require
sources
to
develop
more
broadbased
broad
based
plans
and
accounting
systems
to
track
not
only
cleaning
solvent
usage
but
,
specifically
in
the
case
of
option
1
,
a
plan
to
address
wastes
from
other
media
.
the
committee
considered
that
the
proposed
rule
required
tracking
finishing
material
usage
(
to
demonstrate
compliance
with
the
emission
limits
,
cleaning
solvent
usage
,
and
washoff
solvent
usage
;
the
committee
believed
that
these
requirements
were
good
foundations
to
any
multimedia
,
pollution
prevention
plan
.
therefore
,
the
committee
did
not
recommend
that
additional
plans
be
required
.
option
3
was
not
considered
necessary
by
the
committee
because
the
emission
limits
address
the
addition
of
thinner
to
coatings
.
finally
,
option
5
,
the
use
of
recycling
gun
washers
,
was
not
proposed
because
the
work
practice
work
group
did
not
have
data
on
these
systems
that
indicated
they
were
more
efficient
than
other
methods
of
spray
gun
cleaning
.
because
there
are
no
data
on
the
effectiveness
of
these
units
,
the
committee
concluded
that
industry
should
not
be
required
to
purchase
them
,
especially
because
the
proposed
work
practices
already
require
flushing
solvent
used
for
gun
cleaning
into
normally
closed
containers
.
the
committee
recognized
that
many
work
practices
are
proposed
for
this
rule
and
implementation
and
compliance
could
become
complicated
.
however
,
looking
at
other
control
techniques
feasible
for
this
industry
,
the
committee
concluded
that
work
practices
would
be
the
most
technically
feasible
and
least
costly
.
the
epa
specifically
requests
comments
on
the
work
practice
standards
:
(
1
)
do
the
work
practices
(
in
conjunction
with
the
emission
limits
)
adequately
reduce
hap
emissions
;
and
(
2
)
are
the
work
practices
overly
burdensome
to
implement
or
should
additional
work
practices
be
considered
?
the
epa
requests
data
to
support
or
refute
a
proposed
work
practice
or
,
for
additional
work
practices
that
are
suggested
,
evidence
of
its
effectiveness
in
reducing
emissions
.
