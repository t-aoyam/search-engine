executive
order
12866
these
final
regulations
have
been
reviewed
in
accordance
with
executive
order
12866
.
under
the
terms
of
the
order
,
the
secretary
has
assessed
the
potential
costs
and
benefits
of
this
regulatory
action
.
the
potential
benefits
associated
with
these
regulations
are
clear
.
rather
than
continuing
to
operate
multiple
assessment
systems
for
federal
and
state
purposes
,
some
states
may
use
their
state
systems
to
evaluate
their
chapter
1
and
mep
programs
.
moreover
,
the
potential
costs
associated
with
these
regulations
are
negligible
.
because
the
regulations
permit
states
to
use
their
own
assessment
systems
,
states
will
incur
few
,
if
any
,
additional
costs
.
to
the
contrary
,
these
regulations
will
result
in
reduced
costs
for
states
that
might
otherwise
have
had
to
operate
multiple
assessment
systems
.
the
secretary
has
also
determined
that
this
regulatory
action
does
not
unduly
interfere
with
state
,
local
,
and
tribal
governments
in
the
exercise
of
their
governmental
functions
.

these
