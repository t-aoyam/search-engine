osha
is
making
no
changes
in
the
protective
clothing
provisions
for

industry
.
paragraph
(
i
)
construction
and
shipyard
standards
.
there
are
several
protective
clothing
issues
in
this
rulemaking
.
the
first
issue
involves
the
impact
of
the
class
system
on
the
personal
protective
clothing
provisions
.
the
existing
standard
requires
that
protective
clothing
be
provided
and
worn
when
exposures
exceed
the
pel
.
the
revised
standards
maintain
this
requirement
.
in
addition
,
the
revised
standards
require
the
use
of
personal
protective
clothing
when
class
i
work
is
performed
and
when
class
iii
work
involving
tsi
and
surfacing
acm
is
performed
in
the
absence
of
a
negative
exposure
assessment
.
osha
believes
that
this
change
brings
the
standard
in
line
with
oshas
1986
intentions
wherein
the
agency
believed
that
removal
of
thermal
insulation
and
surfacing
materials
would
result
in
exposures
that
exceed
the
pel
.
this
rulemaking
record
shows
that
some
employers
have
developed
control
strategies
that
can
reduce
exposures
below
the
pels
,
for
most
of
the
time
.
however
,
as
previously
discussed
,
work
with
highrisk
high
risk
materials
has
substantial
potential
for
overexposure
exposure
.
furthermore
,
studies
have
documented
that
in
the
past
workers
have
brought
asbestos
contaminated
clothing
home
with
them
and
thereby
caused
exposure
and
asbestosrelated
asbestos
related
disease
among
family
members
.
osha
believes
that
this
standard
must
prevent
such
conditions
,
and
the
nature
of
class
i
work
and
class
iii
work
with
high
risk
materials
merits
special
consideration
.
nearly
all
rulemaking
participants
agree
on
this
point
.
osha
notes
however
,
that
the
judgment
to
require
protective
clothing
for
asbestos
work
is
a
subjective
one
,
to
some
extent
,
requiring
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
competent
person
.
the
hazard
from
asbestos
is
associated
with
inhalation
of
fibers
that
are
in
the
air
,
not
from
asbestos
that
comes
in
contact
with
the
skin
,
like
some
other
chemical
that
osha
has
regulated
(
such
as
methylenedianiline
and
benzene
,
which
are
absorbed
through
the
skin
and
are
systemic
toxins
.
asbestos
fibers
that
are
on
clothing
can
become
airborne
,
so
osha
continues
to
believe
that
situations
where
airborne
fiber
levels
are
high
are
also
those
which
are
likely
to
contaminate
clothing
.
therefore
,
the
regulation
continues
the
requirement
for
protective
clothing
and
its
proper
disposal
cleaning
.
osha
does
not
believe
,
however
,
that
protective
clothing
is
required
for
every
operation
involving
asbestos
.
in
the
1986
standards
osha
did
not
require
that
protective
clothing
be
impermeable
;
in
fact
,
osha
responded
to
concerns
that
disposable
clothing
which
was
impermeable
not
be
permitted
because
it
was
claimed
to
contribute
to
heat
stress
(
see
discussion
at
51
fr
22722
.
although
the
issue
was
not
remanded
to
osha
by
the
court
,
several
participants
in
the
current
rulemaking
focussed
comment
on
the
issue
of
whether
osha
should
require
work
clothing
during
asbestos
work
be
impermeable
to
asbestos
fibers
in
each
of
its
asbestos
standards
.
most
of
those
who
addressed
the
issue
expressed
support
for
having
such
a
requirement
(

it
should
also
be
noted
that
several
of
these
commenters
were
manufacturers
of
such
fabric
or
clothing
.
they
also
encouraged
osha
to
set
a
requirement
that
all
garments
meet
the
requirements
of
the
ansi
standard

.

which
indicated
that
neither
shampooing

hair
nor
showering
following
simulated
asbestos
exposure
completely
removed
fibers
from

or
skin
(
ex

)
to
support
their
request
for
an
impermeable
clothing
requirement
.
in
response
to
questioning
about
heat
stress
,
he
stated
that
:
weve
had
projects
for
years
on
improving
the
breathability
of
tyvek
and
in
fact
we
have
some
material
that
exhibits
improved
breathability
and
the
problem
you
always
get
when
you
get
more
breathability
,
you
get
more
asbestos
.

but

osha
continues
to
believe
that
heat
stress
is
also
a
concern
in
use
of
protective
clothing
made
of
impervious
fabric
.
it
should
again
be
noted
that
the
route
of
exposure
of
asbestos
fibers
which
creates
a
health
hazard
is
inhalation
,
not
skin
absorption
.
the
agency
reiterates
its
belief
that
nondisposable
disposable
work
clothes
provide
sufficient
protection
provided
they
are
properly
cleaned
after
work
and
laundered
.
the
agency
agrees
that

osha
is
changing
the
decontamination
requirements
in
minor
details
to
correspond
to
its
new
system
of
categorizing
asbestos
work
according
to
its
potential
risk
.
the
primary
requirement
that
asbestos
abatement
workers
be
decontaminated
following
their
work
using
a
3part
part
systeman
equipment
room
,
a
shower
room
,
and
a
clean
room
,
is
retained
.
thus
,
most
workers
performing
class
i
work
,
removing
tsi
or
surfacing
acm
or
pacm
,
as
before
,
must
use
a
shower
adjacent
to
and
connected
with
the
work
area
.
with
the
introduction
of
new
provisions
identifying
4
classes
of
asbestos
work
,
it
is
necessary
that
osha
modify
its
requirement
for
hygiene
facilities
and
practices
to
reflect
these
changes
.
osha
continues
in
its
belief
that
the
requirements
must
be
proportional
to
the
magnitude
and
likelihood
of
asbestos
exposure
.
therefore
the
most
hazardous

consisting
of

which
workers
must
enter

exit

as
required
in
the
1986
standard
