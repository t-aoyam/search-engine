by
far
the
most
significant
parameters
in
the
models
are
those
describing
the
absorption
,
metabolism
,
and
clearance
of
nicotine
and
cotinine
.
the
robinson
model
uses
reported
human
hepatic
and
renal
clearance
values
for
nicotine
and
cotinine
.
the
sensitivity
of
this
model
to
these
input
parameters
was
investigated
by
varying
them
within
the
range
of
reported
clearance
values
from
infusion
studies
in
humans
.
the
resulting
model
predictions
for
postinfusion
infusion
blood
levels
,
urinary
output
,
and
the
elimination
halflives
half
lives
of
both
nicotine
and
cotinine
were
found
to
be
well
within
the
ranges
of
those
observed
in
human
studies
.
thus
the
model
structure
does
not
produce
an
exaggerated
response
to
variation
of
the
input
parameters
,
and
reflects
the
natural
interaction
between
measures
of
clearance
,
volume
of
distribution
,
and
rates
of
elimination
.
in
the
case
of
the
physiological
parameters
,
variability
dominates
over
uncertainty
,
while
for
the
distributional
parameters
,
uncertainty
dominates
.
in
the
case
of
the
kinetic
parameters
describing
clearance
,
it
appears
that
variability
again
dominates
.
for
example
,
the
mean
values
for
the
terminal
halflife
half
life
of
cotinine
reported
in
different
studies
range
from
12
to
21

the
coefficient

in
these

a
measure
of
interindividual

ranges
from

,
and
the
coefficient
