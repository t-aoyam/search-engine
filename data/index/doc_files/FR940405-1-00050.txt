concern
over
the
carcinogenic
effects
of
ets
was
expressed
in
many
comments
submitted
to
the
docket

such

,
and

.
the
results
of
epidemiological
and
experimental
studies
indicate
that
exposure
to
ets
is
causally
associated
with
cancer
of
the
lung
in

discussion

this

evidence

_
the
results
of
epidemiological
studies
taken
in
the
aggregate
suggest
that
nonsmoker
exposure
to
ets
is

causally

the

evidence
of

of
effect
is
provided
by
active

studies
that
report
a
causal
association
with

cancer
[

it
was
therefore
logical
to
examine
nonsmokers
with
passive
exposure
to
tobacco
smoke
,
since
the
chemicals
found
in
passive
smoke
are
qualitatively
similar
to
those
in
mainstream
smoke
.

smoking

.
the
results
of
lung
cancer
studies
that
examined
the
variation
in
tumor
cell
type
induced
by
ets
exposure
indicate
that
mostly
adenocarcinomas
and
squamous
cell
carcinomas
are
produced
by
ets
exposure
.
some
studies
have
reported
an
excess
of
adenocarcinomas
,
while
others
have
reported
excesses
in
squamous
cell
and
smallcell
small
cell
carcinomas
.
from
this
information
,
it
is
apparent
that
similar
tumor
cell
types
are
induced
by
ets
exposure
as
are
induced
by
active
smoking
.
the
unequivocal
causal
association
between
active
tobacco
smoking
and
lung
cancer
in
humans
,
as
well
as
the
corroborative
evidence
of
the
carcinogenicity
of
tobacco
smoke
provided
by
animal
bioassays
and
in
vitro
studies
and
the
chemical
similarity
between
mainstream
smoke
and
ets
,
clearly
establish
the
plausibility
that
ets
is
also
a
human
lung
carcinogen
(

in

biomarker

verify
that
ets

results
in
