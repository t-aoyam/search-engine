as
noted
above
in

discussion
,
osha
is
requiring
job
by
job
evaluation
of
each
class
ii
job
,
including
transite
panel
removal
projects
,
by
a
competent
person
,
as
part
of
the
requirements
to
perform
an
initial
exposure
assessment
.
as
detailed
above
,
the
data
submitted
to
the
record
show
that
transite
panel
removal
without
cutting
usually
results
in
very
low
exposure
levels
.
building
and
facility
records
of
past
removals
of
similar
material
will
alert
onsite
on
site
competent
persons
to
the
exposure
potential
of
the
panels
in
their
facilities
.
for
rare
cases
,
when
the
evaluation
of
material
,
condition
,
crew
and
past
exposure
data
do
not
support
a
`
negative
exposure
assessment
'
(
ie
,
that
excessive
exposures
may
be
expected
,
additional
precautions
are
required
by
the
standard
,
including
critical
barriers
,
and
respirator
use
.
osha
believes
that
these
provisions
will
protect
employees
against
significant
exposures
,
are
feasible
,
and
are
supported
by
the
record
.
in
particular
osha
finds
that
quantity
limitations
on
transite
panel
removal
would
not
tend
to
reduce
risk
,
and
in
some
cases
may
increase
fiber
levels
.
for
example
,
richard
olson
of
dow

.
pointed
out
that
if
transite
panel
removal
were
to
be
exempted
from
the
negative
pressure
enclosure
requirement
and
the
cutoff
remained
at
9
square
feet
as
proposed
,
it
would
be
necessary
to
cut
nearly
every
piece
of
material
removed
or
always
use
a

the
removal
of
cementitious

asbestos
containing

is
a
class
ii
activity
.
osha
is
requiring
the
same
work
practices
for
shingle
removal
as
for
transite
panel
removal
.
osha
did
not
propose
specific
work
practices
for
removal
of
cacs
,
either
to
exempt
this
activity
from
the
negative

requirement
or
to
qualify

however
,
many
participants
representing
a
wide
spectrum
of
interests
,
including
states
,

agencies
,
and

,
recommended
that

osha
agrees
and
believes
that
the
methods
required
by
the
standard
will
reduce
risk
significantly
for
exposed
workers
.
results
of
this
study
and
others
show
that
cacs
removal
can
be
performed
using
work
practices
which
minimize
exposure
to
workers
and
that
containment
in
npes
is
neither
necessary
or
appropriate
in
most
cases
to
protect
the
workers
performing
the
removals
or
working
nearby
.
however
,
it
is
clear
that
class
ii
work
practices
are
necessary
to
keep
exposures
low
.
osha
has
coupled
cacs
removal
with
transite
panel
removal
in
the
regulatory
provisions
establishing
mandatory
work
practices
for
the
removal
of
these
materials
.
roofing
operations
the
final
construction
standard
classifies
removal
of
roofing
material
which
contains
asbestos
as
a
class
ii
operation
.
as
such
,
specific
exposure
assessment
and
work
practices
must
be
performed
.
the
record
shows
that
these
work
practices
can
be
feasibly
implemented
and
are
necessary
to
effectively
reduce
airborne
asbestos
levels
from
roofing
removal
projects
.
they
consist
of
continual
misting
of
cutting
machines
during
use
,
keeping
roofing
materials
intact
during
removal
,
using
wet
methods
,
immediately
lowering
unwrapped
or
unbagged
roofing
material
to
a
covered
receptacle
using
a
dusttight
dust
tight

,
or
immediately
wrapping

material
