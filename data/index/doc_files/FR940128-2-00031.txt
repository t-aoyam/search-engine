posix2
contains
a
number
of
features
that
are
labelled
obsolescent
.
these
features
violate
the
general
syntactic
guidelines
of
posix2
.
they
were
included
in
posix2
to
provide
upward
compatibility
of
existing
applications
,
and
may
be
deleted
from
posix2
at
some
future

the
posix2
standard
requires
that
strictly
conforming
applications
do
not
use
any
of
these
features
.
it
is
strongly
recommended
that
agencies
that
require
the
posix2
fips
prohibit
users
from
using
these
features
.
therefore
,
the
following
obsolescent
features
are
not
required

be
compliant
with
the
posix2
fips
