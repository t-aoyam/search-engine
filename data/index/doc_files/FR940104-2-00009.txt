supplementary
information
:
the
national
institute
of
standards
and
technology
seeks
industrial
and
academic
parties
interested
in
entering
into
a
cooperative
research
consortium
on
the
development
of
open
systems
technology
for
virtual
libraries
and
electronic
document
interchange
.
nist
wishes
to
pursue
interoperable
and
portable
open
systems
that
will
improve
the
use
of
information
technology
in
conducting
government
programs
and
in
providing
services
to
the
public
,
and
,
in
particular
,
improve
the
use
and
exchange
of
electronic
documents
in
many
forms
as
an
aid
to
the
performance
of
daily
business
activities
and
research
activities
.
the
open
information
systems
movement
is
gaining
momentum
because
many
researchers
and
users
realize
that
no
single
vendor
can
supply
all
the
needs
for
an
informationbased
information
based
society
.
open
systems
are
needed
to
provide
for
interoperability
of
software
,
hardware
,
and
communications
systems
products
,
and
for
portability
of
data
and
applications
across
heterogeneous
computing
environments
.
while
there
is
a
strong
movement
to
standards
for
interconnecting
hardware
,
software
and
network
systems
,
there
are
many
proprietary
products
and
systems
in
use
.
nist
has
developed
the
application
portability
profile
(
app
,
the
us
.
governments
open
system
environment
profile
,
which
integrates
standards
and
other
specifications
to
address
a
broad
range
of
information
technology
requirements
.
the
purpose
of
this
consortium
is
to
develop
technology
that
will
promote
the
exchange
of
electronic
documents
and
improve
user
access
to
information
in
various
forms
and
locations
.
this
technology
will
fit
into
the
app
framework
.
this
program
is
being
undertaken
within
the
scope
