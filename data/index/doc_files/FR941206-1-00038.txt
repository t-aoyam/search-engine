section
182d1a
)
of
the
act
requires
the
state
to
offset
any
growth
in
emissions
from
growth
in
vmt
.
as
discussed
in
the
general
preamble
,
the
purpose
is
to
prevent
growth
in
motor
vehicle
emissions
from
canceling
out
the
emission
reduction
benefits
of
the
federally
mandated
programs
in
the
act
.
the
usepa
interprets
this
provision
to
require
that
sufficient
measures
be
adopted
so
that
projected
motor
vehicle
volatile
organic
compound
(
voc
)
emissions
will
never
be
higher
during
the
ozone
season
in
one
year
than
during
the
ozone
season
in
the
year
before
.
when
growth
in
vmt
and
vehicle
trips
would
otherwise
cause
a
motor
vehicle
emissions
upturn
,
this
upturn
must
be
prevented
.
the
emissions
level
at
the
point
of
upturn
becomes
a
ceiling
on
motor
vehicle
emissions
.
this
requirement
applies
to
projected
emissions
in
the
years
between
the
submission
of
the
sip
revision
and
the
attainment
deadline
and
is
above
and
beyond
the
separate
requirements
for
the
rfp
and
the
attainment
demonstrations
.
the
ceiling
level
is
defined
therefore
,
up
to
the
point
of
upturn
,
as
motor
vehicle
emissions
that
would
occur
in
the
ozone
season
of
that
year
,
with
vmt
growth
,
if
all
measures
for
that
area
in
that
year
were
implemented
as
required
by
the
act
.
when
this
curve
begins
to
turn
up
due
to
growth
in
vmt
or
vehicle
trips
,
the
ceiling
becomes
a
fixed
value
.
the
ceiling
line
would
include
the
effects
of
federal
measures
such
as
new
motor
vehicle
standards
,
phase
ii
rvp
controls
,
and
reformulated
gasoline
,
as
well
as
the
act
mandated
sip
requirements
.
the
state
of
illinois
has
demonstrated
in
its
submittal
of
07/14/1994
,
that
the
predicted
growth
in
vmt
in
the
chicago
,
illinois
nonattainment
area
is
not
expected
to
result
in
a
growth
in
motor
vehicle
emissions
that
will
negate
the
effects
of
the
reductions
mandated
by
the
act
.
further
,
illinois
has
projected
motor
vehicle
emissions
to
the
year
2007
and
has
not
predicted
an
upturn
in
motor
vehicle
emissions
.
the
nonattainment
area
includes
the
counties
of
cook
,
dupage
,
kane
,
lake
,
mchenry
,
will
and
the
townships
of
aux
sable
and
goose
lake
in
grundy
county
and
oswego
in
kendall
county
.
the
mobile5a
model
was
used
to
calculate
fleetwide
onhighway
on
highway
motor
vehicle
emission
factors
for
future
years
.
the
average
summer
weekday
vmt
for
1990
has
been
estimated
to
be
140
35
million
miles
for
the
baseline
inventory
.
for
the
years
1990
to
1996
,
illinois
used
a
vmt
growth
rate
of
27
percent
per
year
for
the
chicago
nonattainment
area
.
there
are
indications
that
vmt
growth
may
be
slowing
.
since
the
future
vmt
growth
can
be
difficult
to
predict
,
illinois
used
three
different
possible
vmt
growth
rates
to
project
mobile
source
emissions
and
demonstrate
compliance
.
illinois
estimated
mobile
source
emissions
at
a
vmt
growth
rate
of
1
percent
,
2
percent
and
27
percent
per
year
for
1996
to
2007
.
the
07/14/1994
,
submittal
lists
the
predicted
average
summer
weekday
vmt
for
the
years
1990
,
1996
,
1999
,
2004
and
2007
at
each
of
the
three
vmt
growth
rates
.
the
mobile5a
model
was
used
to
estimate
motor
vehicle
emission
rates
for
the
specified
years
as
mandatory
control
measures
become
effective
.
the
control
measures
whose
effects
were
modeled
were
:
the
federal
motor
vehicle
control
program
;
volatility
controls
for
gasoline
and
reformulated
gasoline
;
and
the
inspection
and
maintenance
program
(
both
the
current
program
to
1996
and
the
enhanced
program
from
1996
to
2007
.
there
were
no
benefits
taken
for
the
employee
commute
options
program
.
even
at
the
27
percent
per
year
vmt
growth
rate
,
no
upturn
in
mobile
source
emissions
is
predicted
.
the
07/14/1994
,
submittal
demonstrates
that
emissions
will
continue
to
decline
through
the
year
2010
.
this
demonstration
meets
the
first
requirement
of
the
3
part
submittal
.
on
11/15/1993
,
illinois
submitted
the
15
percent
reasonable
further
progress
plan
.
this
submittal
relies
on
a
2
ton
per
day
credit
from
transportation
control
measures
(
tcms
)
to
meet
the
15
percent
reduction
.
a
listing
of
tcms
was
submitted
with
the
sip
submittal
.
on
12/09/1993
,
the
chicago
area
transportation
studys
policy
committee
officially
adopted
this
package
of
tcms
as
a
component
of
the
illinois
15
percent
plan
.
many
of
the
tcms
have
already
been
implemented
and
all
of
the
tcms
have
been
included
in
the
chicago
areas
transportation
improvement
program
.
the
usepa
requires
further
documentation
on
these
tcms
before
the
second
element
can
be
fully
approved
.
the
further
requirements
for
illinois
'
tcm
package
are
discussed
in
a
05/20/1994
,
letter
from
the
usepa
regional
administrator
to
the
director
of
the
illinois
environmental
protection
agency
.
at
this
time
,
illinois
has
met
the
vmt
offset
requirement
by
using
tcms
as
necessary
in
the
15
percent
plan
.
the
usepa
is
proposing
to
approve
the
second
element
when
a
favorable
finding
of
completeness
on
the
15
percent
plan
is
made
.
the
attainment
demonstration
and
the
post1996
post
rfp
sips
are
due
on
11/15/1994
.
illinois
will
address
any
necessary
tcms
to
reach
attainment
and
meet
the
post1996
post
rfp
in
those
sip
submittals
.
