fsis
believes
that
potential
bacterial
hazards
are
diminished
as
long
as
handling
accords
with
good
manufacturing
practices
.
fsis
is
,
therefore
,
considering
that
processing
and
storage
requirements
are
warranted
for
the
raw
materials
used
to
make
the
product
and
for
the

itself
.
fsis
is
considering
proposing
handling
requirements
that
would
provide
that

to
be
processed
into
boneless

products
produced
by
mechanical

with
06

or
less

from
the
time
it
is
separated
from

within
2
hours
of
the
mechanical
deboning
operation
,
fsis
is
also
considering
proposing
that
boneless
poultry
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
be
chilled
to
40

(

frozen
to

or
cooked
.
fsis
is
further
considering
proposing
that
boneless
poultry
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
be
used
as
an
ingredient
in
a
poultry
or
meat
food
product
directly
after
being
processed

except
that
it
may
be
held
prior
to
such

fsis
wishes
to
receive
comments
on
whether
specific
handling
requirements
other
than
those
being
considered
are
appropriate
for
specific
types
of

materials
.
in

,
in
order
to
avoid
confusion
about
the

state
of

fsis
intends
to
provide
a
definition
of
`
poultry
carcasses

'
the
terms
`
poultry

'
or

fsis
is

that

there

tentative

on
amending
the
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
with
06
percent

covers
such

prepared

it
is
not

fsiss
intention
to
permit
use
of
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
as
an
ingredient
in
any
given
poultry
product
regardless
of
the
kind
of
poultry
from
which
it
is
made
.
such
action
would
be
inconsistent
with
existing
regulatory
requirements
and
interpretations
and
could
,
among
other
things
,
result
in
false
or
misleading
labeling
.
fsis
intends
to
provide
that
when
a
poultry
product
is
required
to
be
prepared
from
a
particular
kind
of
kinds
of
poultry
(
eg
,
chickens
,
use
of
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
of
any
other
kind
(
eg
,
poultry
product
made
from
turkey
)
should
not
be
permitted
.
this
provision
would
assure
that
boneless
poultry
product
made
from
a
different
kind
of
poultry
is
not
used
in
a
poultry
product
represented
as
containing
ingredients
from
a
particular
kind
or
kinds
of
poultry
.
(

)
tentative
position
:
limitation
on
product
made
from
fowl
.
in
the
past
,
the
agency
has
had
a
policy
of
discouraging
the
use
of
mdp
containing
1
percent
or
less
bone
solids
content
for
use
in
baby
,
junior
,
and
toddler
foods
because
of
concern
for
higher
levels
of
fluoride
present
in
the
bones
of
mature
poultry
.
however
,
fsis
believes
that
at
the
low
level
of
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
content
there
would
be
no
reason
to
place
a
restriction
on
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
for
use
in
baby
,
junior
,
and
toddler
foods
based
on
the
potential
fluoride
contribution
of
product
made
from
fowl
to
dietary
intakes
.
furthermore
,
there
is
research
to
indicate
a
very
poor
absorption
of
fluorine
from
bone
particles
coupled
with
a
large
body
of
research
indicating
beneficial
effects
of
fluoride
at
lower
levels
.
with
the
restriction
of
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
content
,
levels
of
fluoride
present
would
not
present
a
health
and
safety
concern
.
