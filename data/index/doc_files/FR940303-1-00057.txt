fsis
is
considering
issues
in
regard
to
the
lack
of
a
regulatory
definition
and
standard
for
certain
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboningproducts
which
are
deemed
to
be
similar
to
mss
.
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
result
from
the
mechanical
separation
and
removal
of
most
of
the
bone
from
attached
skeletal
muscle
and
other
tissue
of
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
.
over
the
years
,
the
meat
and
poultry
industries
have
referred
to
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
as
`
mechanically
deboned
poultry
'
and
`
comminuted
poultry
'
and
have
declared
the
product
as
poultry
or
poultry
meat
(
eg
,
`
chicken
'
and
`
turkey
meat
)
on
the
labels
of
products
in
which
they
are
used
as
ingredients
.
several
red
meat
sausage
manufacturers
have
alleged
that
without
a
regulatory
definition
and
standard
for
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
,
a
disparate
situation
exists
between
labeling
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
and
mss
)
which
poses
an
unfair
advantage
for
the
manufacturers
of
poultry
products
.
fsis
has
considered
the
appropriate
course
for
addressing
these
issues
and
has
initiated
two
actions
in
response
to
them
.
fsis
is
contemplating
proposing
regulations
on
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
,
and
will
be
soliciting
comments
and
requesting
data
on
various
tentative
positions
in
a
notice
that
appears
elsewhere
in
this
issue
of
the
federal
register
.
.
the
second
action
is
the
subject
of
this
proposed
rule
which
focuses
on
the
meat
product
derived
from
the
advances
in
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
recovery
systems
that
is
comparable
to
`
meat
'
as
traditionally
defined
in
9
cfr
3012rr
.
fsis
now
believes
that
advances
in
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
meat
recovery
systems
,
which
do
not
grind
,
crush
,
or
pulverize
bone
in
order
to
remove
skeletal
muscle
tissue
adhering
to
bones
of
livestock
(
ie
,
bones
of
cattle
,
sheep
,
swine
,
and
goats
)
result
in
a
product
which
,
unlike
mss
,
is
comparable
to
`
meat
'
as
traditionally
defined
.
since
the
1970s
,
there
has
been
increasing
commercial
production
of
processed
meat
products
that
are
formulated
with
comminuted
(
ie
,
ground
)
meat
,
eg
,
hot
dogs
,
in
order
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
market
for
such
products
.
most
of
the
technology
that
has
found
commercial
use
will
evolve
in
the
form
of
improvements
to
meet
the
demands
of
consumers
and
industry
.
the
demands
of
the
industry
have
centered
around
the
desire
to
harvest
more
usable
protein
,
ie
,
muscle
tissue
,
and
to
find
alternatives
to
recovering
more
usable
protein
,
from
livestock
carcasses
to
meet
consumer
demands
for
the
processed
meat
products
formulated
with
skeletal
muscle
tissue
obtained
by
mechanical
removal
.
mechanization
also
diminishes
the
economic
implications
of
removing
meat
by
hand
caused
by
repetitive
motion
disorders
for
workers
that
handdebone
hand
debone
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
using
knives
,
and
by
knife
accidents
.
industry
data
indicate
that
over
300000
cases
of
cumulative
trauma
disorder
(
eg
,
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
)
have
occurred
in
the
meat
industry
due
to
the
strain
of
repetitive
movements
to
remove
meat
from
bones
.
the
demands
of
the
consumer
and
industry
have
resulted
in
improvements
in
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
meat
recovery
systems
to
improve
yields
and
,
simultaneously
,
to
make
the
process
better
ergonomically
.

over
the
past
decade
,
fsis
has
monitored
the
tremendous
strides
in
modernizing
the
meat
bone
separation
machinery
.
fsis
believes
that
there
are
meat
bone
separators
and
meat
recovery
systems
that
are
fundamentally
different
than
the
machines
used
to
manufacture
mss
.
these
differences
occur
in
terms
of
the
efficiency
and
effectiveness
of
the
process
of
separating
skeletal
muscle
tissue
and
bone
.
the
removal
of
muscle
tissue
from
livestock
bones
since
the
advent
of
automatic
means
of
skeletal
muscle
tissue
removal
from
bone
using
highspeed
high
speed
knives
,
eg
,
the
wizard
knife
,
machines
that
are
classified
as
meat
bone
separators
have
been
developed
that
emulate
the
physical
action
of
the
highspeed
high
speed
knives
.
the
advances
in
meat
bone
separation
have
led
to
recovery
systems
that
separate
meat
from
bone
without
crushing
,
grinding
,
or
pulverizing
bones
such
that
the
meat
is
removed
by
shaving
,
pressing
,
or
scraping
the
muscle
tissue
from
the
bone
surface
similar
to
the
action
of
the
handheld
hand
held
highspeed
high
speed
knives
.
thus
,
this
meat
is
obtained
in
much
the
same
manner
as
that
which
is
obtained
using
traditional
handdeboning
hand
deboning
techniques
,
where
the
bones
emerge
separately
from
the
meat
in
the
process
,
essentially
intact
and
in
natural
physical
conformation
.
for
example
,
the
most
commonly
used
bones
would
include
rib
bones
and
loin
bones
and
would
be
recognized
as
such
when
they
emerge
from
the
meat
bone
separation
machinery
.
fsis
believes
that
the
description
of
the
bones
from
which
muscle
tissue
has
been
removed
as
`
essentially
intact
'
is
consistent
with
the
description
of
the
bones
resulting
from
the
removal
of
muscle
tissue
by
handdeboning
hand
deboning
using
knives
,
including
highspeed
high
speed
mechanical
knives
,
such
as
the
wizard
knife
.
fsis
recognizes
that
even
with
the
use
of
handoperated
hand
operated
knives
,
eg
,
in
the
processing
establishment
,
at
the
supermarket
meat
counter
,
or
by
the
consumer
,
there
is
the
possibility
of
shaving
,
pressing
,
or
scraping
close
to
the
bone
surface
so
as
to
unavoidably
remove
a
minute
amount
of
the
bones
surface
when
meat
is
removed
.
fsis
believes
that
this
is
a
normal
occurrence
because
of
the
difficulty
in
exercising
precision
in
handdeboning
hand
deboning
operations
,
and
,
as
such
,
it
is
still
in
conformance
with
good
manufacturing
practices
that
render
products
safe
and
wholesome
.
because
the
bones
emerge
from
the
advanced
meat
bone
separators
in
their
natural
shape
and
structure
,
ie
,
with
the
connective
tissue
linkages
that
normally
occur
in
bones
,
fsis
maintains
that
they
are
in
natural
physical
conformation
.
furthermore
,
under
fsiss
longstanding
boneless
meat
inspection
procedure
for
meat
derived
by
handdeboning
hand
deboning
techniques
,
it
is
expected
that
the
finished
comminuted
(
ie
,
ground
)
meat
product
made
from
the
meat
removed
from
livestock
bones
contains
no
bone
perceptible
to
sight
or
touch
.
this
result
would
be
expected
for
meat
derived
from
the
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
recovery
systems
.
