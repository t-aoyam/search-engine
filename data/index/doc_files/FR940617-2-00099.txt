turning
to
the
third
example
outlined
by
petitioners
involving
the
reporting
of
shared
employees
of
commonly
owned
stations
in
the
same
radio
service
in
the
same
market
,
current
data
processing
technology
available
to
the
commission
does
not
allow
for
the
employment
profile
of
more
than
one
station
to
be
reported
on
the
same
form
395b
except
in
cases
involving
an
am
fm
combination
.
therefore
,
if
a
licensee
owns
two
fm
stations
or
two
am
stations
in
the
same
market
,
the
licensee
should
file
a
separate
report
for
each
station
,
dividing
employees
between
the
stations
according
to
their
primary
duties
.
if
the
duties
of
one
or
more
employees
involve
work
for
both
stations
equally
the
licensee
should
file
a
form
395b
for
one
station
with
all
employees
from
both
stations
listed
.
it
should
then
file
a
separate
form
395b
for
the
other
station
explaining
that
the
stations
employees
are
reported
on
the
form
395b
filed
for
the
licensees
other
station
in
the
same
market
.
we
expect
the
licensees
of
multiple
stations
in
the
same
market
to
file
the
form
395b
attributing
employees
to
the
stations
according
to
the
manner
in
which
the
stations
operate
.
