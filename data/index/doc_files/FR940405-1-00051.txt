osha
considered
the
consistency
of
the
association
to
determine
if
the
finding
of
the
same
exposure
effect
occurred
in
different
populations
and
different
types
of
studies
.
the
great
number
of
epidemiological
studies
available
on
ets
were
conducted
by
different
researchers
,
on
different
populations
,
in
various
countries
with
diverse
study
designs
.
this
extensive
amount
of
data
increases
confidence
that
the
associations
seen
between
ets
exposure
and
the
development
of
lung
cancer
is
externally
consistent
and
is
not
due
to
artifacts
or
a
product
of
some
unidentified
,
indirect
factors
unlikely
to
be
common
to
all
of
the
studies
.
the
fact
that
exposure
to
ets
is
common
dilutes
the
risk
estimates
derived
from
these
studies
because
the
comparison
group
has
some
exposure
to
ets
.
a
recent
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
(
cdc
)
report
[
ex

450
]
found
that
100
%
of
a
subset
of
the
national
health
and
nutrition
evaluation
survey
(
nhanes
)
iii
conducted
by
the
national
center
for
health
statistics
had
detectable
levels
of
cotinine
in
their
bodies
indicating
that
everyone
in
the
sample
had
detectable
exposure
to
tobacco
smoke
[

450
.
cotinine
is
a
metabolite
of
nicotine
and
is
used
as
a
surrogate
of
exposure
to
tobacco
smoke
.
this
indicates
that
the
cancer
risk
may
indeed
be
greater
since
the
relationship
in
these
studies
has
been
more
exposed
versus
less
exposed
instead
of
exposed
versus
nonexposed
.
many
potential
sources
of
bias

as
publication

the
tendency

,
misclassification
bias

the
reliance

self
reporting

exposure

tobacco
smoke
)
can
not
account
for
the
elevation
in
risks
seen
in
these
various
studies
.
also
,
the
relative
risks
that
were
estimated
from
prospective
study
data
are
similar
to
those
estimated
from
case
control
study
data
.
biases
that
may
be
problematic
to
casecontrol
case
control
studies
are
not
a
problem
in
prospective
studies
.
since
the
results
from
both
types
of
studies
are
similar
it
is
apparent
that
these
biases
are
not
important
in
the
casecontrol
case
control
studies

recall
