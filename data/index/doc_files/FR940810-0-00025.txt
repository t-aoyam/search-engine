regulatory
history
on
03/08/1994
,
the
coast
guard
published
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
in
the
federal
register
for
these
regulations
(
59
fr
10772
.
the
coast
guard
did
not
receive
any
letters
commenting
on
the
proposal
.
the
public
hearing
was
requested
,
and
none
was
held
.
background
and
purpose
the
anchorage
for
nitrate
laden
vessels
off
honolulu
harbor
was
a
hold
over
from
world
war
ii
and
no
longer
needed
.
it
encompassed
much
of
the
area
available
for
commercial
vessels
to
anchor
off
honolulu
harbor
.
eliminating
the
nitrate
anchorage
allows
the
establishment
of
four
new
anchorages
and
better
usage
of
the
available
anchoring
area
.
this
rule
brings
the
regulations
in
line
with
current
practice
.
discussion
of
comments
no
comments
were
received
during
the
comment
period
.
no
changes
were
made
to
the
proposed
rule
.
regulatory
evaluation
this
rule
is
not
considered
a
significant
regulatory
action
under
executive
order
12866
and
is
not
significant
under
the
department
of
transportation
regulatory
policies
and
procedures
(
44
fr
11040
;
02/26/1979
.
the
coast
guard
expects
the
economic
impact
of
this
rule
to
be
so
minimal
that
a
regulatory
evaluation
is
unnecessary
.
the
only
effect
of
this
rule
is
to
formally
establish
anchorage
grounds
for
commercial
vessels
off
honolulu
harbor
in
areas
where
they
presently
anchor
.
the
rule
does
not
restrict
access
to
any
fairway
or
channel
,
or
limit
access
to
any
facility
or
area
previously
accessible
to
vessels
.
the
primary
intent
of
the
rule
is
to
designate
anchorages
for
commercial
vessels
of
honolulu
harbor
.
small
entities
the
impact
of
this
rule
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
is
expected
to
be
minimal
.
therefore
,
the
coast
guard
certifies
under
section
605b
)
of
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
(
5
usc
.
601
et
seq
.
)
)
that
this
rule
will
not
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
.
collection
of
information
this
rule
contains
no
collection
of
information
requirements
under
the
paperwork
reduction
act
(
44
usc
.
3501
et
seq
.
)
.
federalism
the
coast
guard
has
analyzed
this
rule
in
accordance
with
the
principals
and
criteria
contained
in
executive
order
12612
and
has
determined
that
this
rule
does
not
have
sufficient
federalism
implications
to
warrant
the
preparation
of
a
federalism
assessment
.
environment
the
coast
guard
considered
the
environmental
impact
of
this
rule
and
concluded
that
under
section
2b2c
of
commandant
instruction
m16475
1b
,
this
rule
is
categorically
excluded
from
further
environmental
documentation
.
a
categorical
exclusion
determination
is
available
in
the
docket
for
inspection
or
