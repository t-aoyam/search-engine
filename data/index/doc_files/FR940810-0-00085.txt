(
in

regulatory

,
however
,
osha
still
relies
on
the

to
be

to

thus

the

either
as

isolates
the
asbestos

in

as
noted
below
,
osha
believes
that
the
size
of
the
removal
job
alone
does
not
predict
the
risk
to
workers
.
however
,
if
a
job
is
smaller
,
the
chances
are
reduced
that
isolation
barriers
provided
by
glove
bags
or
boxes
will
fail
.
osha
was
reluctant
to
limit
glove
bag
removals
without
critical
barriers
only
to
maintenance
projects
,
where
as
niosh
noted
,
it
is
more
likely
that
crews
will
be
untrained
(
ex
.
125
.
rather
,
osha
has
followed
the
lead
of
some
states
,
which
allow
removals
involving
less
than
25
linear
feet
of
tsi
,
and
10
square
feet
of
other
material
to
be
handled
without
critical
barriers
,
unless
the
glove
bags
or
enclosure
loses
its
integrity
(
see
eg
,
12
nycrr
56
)
or
where
a
negative
exposure
assessment
has
not
been
produced
.
such
projects
are
class
i
removals
,
and
workers
required
to
perform
them
must
be
trained
in
an
epaaccredited
epa
accredited
training
course
or
equivalent
;
osha
believes
that
the
work
force
performing
these
relatively
minor
removals
is
the
same
work
force
performing
major
removals
,
thus
the
jobs
will
be
wellconducted
well
conducted
and
critical
barriers
will
be
unnecessary
