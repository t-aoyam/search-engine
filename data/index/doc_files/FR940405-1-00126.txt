federalism
this
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
has
been
reviewed
in
accordance
with
executive
order
12612
(
52
fr
41685
,
october
30
,
1987
,
regarding
federalism
.
this
order
requires
that
agencies
,
to
the
extent
possible
,
refrain
from
limiting
state
policy
options
,
consult
with
states
prior
to
taking
any
actions
which
would
restrict
state
policy
options
,
and
take
such
actions
only
when
there
is
clear
constitutional
authority
and
the
presence
of
a
problem
of
national
scope
.
the
order
provides
for
preemption
of
state
law
only
if
there
is
a
clear
congressional
intent
for
the
agency
to
do
so
.
any
such
preemption
is
to
be
limited
to
the
extent
possible
.
section
18
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
(
osh
act
)
expresses
congress
'
intent
to
preempt
state
laws
that
establish
occupational
safety
and
health
standards
on
issues
on
which
federal
osha
has
promulgated
standards
.
under
section
18
,
a
state
can
avoid
preemption
,
however
,
if
it
submits
,
and
obtains
federal
approval
of
a
plan
for
the
development
of
such
standards
and
their
enforcement
.
therefore
states
with
occupational
safety
and
health
plans
approved
under
section
18
of
the
osh
act
will
be
able
to
develop
their
own
state
standards
to
deal
with
any
special
problems
which
might
be
encountered
in
a
particular
state
.
in
addition
,
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
section
18
does
not
preempt
state
or
local
laws
of
general
applicability
that
do
not
conflict
with
osha
standards
and
that
regulate
the
conduct
of
workers
and
non
workers
alike

such
laws
regulate
workers
simply
as
members
of
the
general
public
.
osha
recognizes
that
many
state
and
local
governments
have
enacted
provisions
designed
to
protect
the
health
of
their
residents
by
addressing
indoor
air
quality
issues
including
the
presence
of

.
it
is
oshas
intent
that
state
and
local
laws
consistent
with
this
standard
shall
remain
in
effect
to
the
full
extent
