concluded
that
`
the
mesothelioma
risk
for
chrysotile
was
an
issue
of
disagreement
;
some
members
of

panel
held
the
view
that
a
lower
estimate
should
be

,
as
it
would
be
more
consistent
with
available

the
crucial
issues
,
neither
of
which
can
be
resolved
unequivocally
,
are
(

what
proportion
of
the
mesotheliomas
observed
in
groups

textile

and

insulation
workers
were
caused
by
their
exposure
to
crocidolite
or
amosite
;
and
(

whether
the
best
general
estimate
of
the
ratio
of
mesothelioma
to
excess
lung
cancer
caused
by
chrysotile
is
provided
by
the
quebec
miners
and

thus
,
although
there
is
some
evidence
linking
chrysotile
to
a
lower
mesothelioma
rate
than
some
amphibole
fiber
types
,
osha
believes
that
there
is
insufficient
evidence
to
show
that
chrysotile
does
not
present
a
significant
mesothelioma
risk
to
exposed
employees
.
furthermore
,
the
major
disease
linked
to
asbestos
exposure
,
lung
cancer
,
occurs
at
the
same
frequency
among
employees
exposed
to
equivalent
doses
of
chrysotile
or
to
amphibole
asbestos
fiber
types
.
indeed
,
evaluation
of
all
of
the
evidence
indicates
that
chrysotile
asbestos
presents
a
similar
significant
risk
of
lung
cancer
and
asbestosis
as
other
forms
of
asbestos
.
since
these
adverse
health
effects
constitute
the
majority
of
diseases
related
to
asbestos
exposure
,
osha
is
still
of
the
opinion
that
chrysotile
exposure
should
be
treated
the
same
as
other
forms
of
asbestos
.
in
addition
to
contentions
that
oshas
risk
assessment
had
overstated
asbestos
risks
because
it
treated
the
risks
from
all
asbestos
fiber
types
equally
,
other
contentions
were
made
that
the
earlier
risk
assessment
may
have
understated
the
risks
from
asbestos
,
because
it
ignored
evidence
of
the
incidence
of
pleural
plaques
,
and
other
asbestos
disease
which
occurred
in
workers
exposed
at
low
levels
,
primarily
as
building
custodians
.
the
earlier
risk
assessment
in
1984
focused
on
whether
there
was
a
significant
risk
of
cancer
and
asbestosis
at
various
levels
of
cumulative
exposure
.
during
this
hearing
,
various
labor
groups
stated
their
position
that
the
presence
of
pleural
plaques
in
asbestos
exposed
employees
is
not
only
a
marker
of
asbestos
exposure
,
but
also
an
independent
`
material
impairment
'
because
they
are
associated
with
a
greater
risk
of
lung
function
impairment
and
pleuritic
pain
.
pleural
plaques
are
focal
areas
of
fibrous
thickening
of
the
pleura
,
the
membrane
lining
the
lung
.
further
,
suggestions
were
made
that
osha
should
reduce
its
pels
to
correspond
to
these
increased
risks
of
`
material
impairment
'
which
occurred
at
lower
exposure
levels
