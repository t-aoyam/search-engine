water
pollution
impacts
the
proposed
standards
are
expected
to
have
no
impact
on
water
pollution
because
waterborne
coatings
are
not
required
to
meet
the
proposed
emission
limitations
.
however
,
the
agency
requests
comment
on
whether
this
assessment
is
correct
and
whether
or
not
an
expansion
of
the
use
of
waterborne
finishes
and
associated
cleanup
operations
,
in
response
to
the
neshap
,
would
impact
water
discharge
from
wood
furniture
manufacturing
plants
.

.
solid
waste
impacts
the
only
impact
of
the
proposed
standards
on
solid
waste
is
a
potential
decrease
resulting
from
the
limitation
on
conventional
air
spray
guns
.
conventional
air
spray
guns
have
a
lower
transfer
efficiency
,
resulting
in
more
overspray
than
other
types
of
spray
application
equipment
.
with
the
use
of
more
efficient
application
equipment
,
overspray
,
and
the
amount
of
waste
solids
generated
from
this
overspray
,
is
reduced
.
due
to
the
uncertainties
in
trying
to
quantify
this
reduction
,
no
estimate
of
the
reduction
in
solid
waste
has
been
made
.
b
.
energy
impacts
the
proposed
standards
are
not
expected
to
impact
energy
usage
by
the
industry
.
as
with
the
secondary
air
pollution
impacts
,
there
may
be
some
impact
on
energy
usage
if
some
facilities
choose
to
use
control
devices
to
meet
the
proposed
standards
.
however
,
these
impacts
have
not
been
estimated
because
facilities
are
likely
to
meet
the
proposed
standards
through
the
use
of
reformulated
material
.
c
.
economic
impacts
the
epa
performed
an
economic
impact
analysis
of
the
requirements
imposed
on
the
wood
furniture
industry
by
this
proposed
rule
.
since
the
economic
impact
analysis
was
completed
,
the
proposed
standards
have
changed
.
the
cost
impacts
presented
in
ivd
reflect
the
changes
in
the
proposed
standards
,
but
the
economic
impacts
presented
here
are
based
on
different
cost
impacts
.
the
economic
impact
analysis
is
based
on
a
total
industrywide
industry
wide
capital
investment
of
$
13335900
,
an
annual
cost
of
$
16801200
,
and
a
cost
effectiveness
of
$
578/mg
(
525/ton
.
because
the
cost
impact
of
the
proposed
standards
is
lower
than
those
used
for
the
economic
impact
analysis
,
the
economic
impacts
presented
here
are
expected
to
be
greater
than
the
actual
economic
impact
.
in
performing
the
economic
impact
analysis
potential
price
,
output
,
employment
,
closure
,
and
secondary
effects
on
affected
segments
of
the
wood
furniture
industry
were
assessed
using
a
market
model
of
supply
and
demand
for
this
industry
.
potential
small
business
impacts
were
also
examined
.
the
economic
impact
analysis
assessed
the
economic
impacts
of
the
proposed
rule
on
the
household
,
cabinet
,
and
commercial
segments
of
the
wood
furniture
industry
.
estimated
market
price
increases
from
the
proposed
rule
are
small
,
0
07
percent
or
less
in
each
of
the
three
segments
.
estimated
reductions
in
market
output
are
also
relatively
small
ranging
from
0
03
percent
in
the
commercial
segment
to
0
20
percent
in
the
household
segment
.
total
employment
losses
were
estimated
at
720
or
approximately
0
22
percent
of
total
industry
employment
.
most
of
these
estimated
losses
(
570
)
occur
in
the
household
furniture
sector
.
of
the
more
than
700
operations
expected
to
be
directly
impacted
,
three
were
predicted
to
close
due
to
implementation
of
this
rule
.
the
dollar
value
of
total
wood
furniture
imports
was
estimated
to
increase
by
0
43
percent
,
reflecting
both
increased
volume
and
higher
prices
.
potential
small
business
impacts
were
predicted
to
be
minimal
.
results
from
the
economic
impact
and
regulatory
flexibility
analyses
indicate
that
smaller
plants
will
not
be
systematically
impacted
more
severely
than
larger
operations
.
moreover
,
the
vast
majority
of
small
operations
,
which
will
not
be
subject
to
the
requirements
of
the
proposed
rule
,
may
benefit
,
to
some
extent
,
from
slightly
increased
wood
furniture
prices
.
d
.
cost
impacts
for
existing
major
sources
,
the
proposed
standards
are
estimated
to
result
in
a
total
industrywide
industry
wide
capital
investment
of
$
7046600
.
this
cost
includes
the
capital
cost
of
equipment
required
to
achieve
compliance
with
the
proposed
standards
.
the
annual
cost
associated
with
the
proposed
standards
is
$
15279600
.
this
cost
includes
the
capital
cost
of
control
(
annualized
,
assuming
a
7percent
percent
interest
rate
and
a
10year
year
equipment

,
annual
operating
cost
including
the
additional
cost
of
using
reformulated
materials
,
worker
training
,
increased
labor
,
and
annual
compliance
,
recordkeeping
,
and
reporting
costs
.
the
annual
control
cost
is
approximately
$
10779600
and
the
annual
compliance
,
recordkeeping
and
reporting
cost
is
approximately
$
4500000
.
the
associated
cost
effectiveness
of
the
proposed
standards
is
$
513/mg
(
466/ton
