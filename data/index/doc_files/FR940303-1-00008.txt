respects

the
department
received
39
comments
from
individuals
and
organizations
outside
of
the
federal
government
.
these
writers
included
private
attorneys
,
public
defenders
,
state
court
judges
,
bar
associations
,
disciplinary
officials
and
others
.
twentyeight
twenty
eight
writers
in
that
group
expressed
opposition
to
the
rule
while
3
supported
the
proposal
.
those
writing
in
support
of
the
earlier
proposal
generally
emphasized
three
major
points
.
first
,
they
stated
that
a
clear
rule
governing
communications
by
federal
attorneys
with
represented
individuals
was
critical
to
the
vigorous
enforcement
of
federal
law
.
several
writers
stated
that
the
lack
of
clarity
on
the
matter
created
by
a
variety
of
court
and
bar
association
opinions
has
had
a
chilling
effect
on
federal
enforcement
efforts
.
they
stated
that
some
federal
prosecutors
fearful
of
the
uncertain
state
of
the
law
and
unwilling
to
risk
their
licenses
to
practice
law
have
decided
not
to
engage
in
routine
discussions
with
represented
individuals
.
second
,
several
writers
described
the
practice
of
some
attorneys
to
claim
representation
of
all
the
employees
of
a
corporate
client
.
they
argued
that
this
practice
,
along
with
the
uncertainty
of
the
state
of
the
disciplinary
rules
,
often
makes
it
exceedingly
difficult
to
investigate
wrongdoing
by
corporations
or
other
organizations
.
third
,
several
supporters
of
the
previous
proposal
stated
that
they
did
not
believe
that
it
was
the
intention
of
dr
7104
and
model
rule
42
to
apply
to
criminal
investigations
.
furthermore
,
they
argued
that
if
the
prohibitions
in
those
rules
apply
to
all
federal
criminal
and
civil
investigations
the
result
will
be
twofold
:
(
1
)
federal
attorneys
will
be
forced
to
reverse
the
trend
of
the
last
20
years
and
become
less
involved
in
investigations
;
and
(
2
)
federal
agents
will
stop
consulting
with
federal
attorneys
during
investigations
.
both
of
these
trends
will
result
in
less
effective
law
enforcement
.
the
department
received
several
comments
critical
of
the
earlier
proposal
.
those
criticisms
fall
generally
in
four
categories
.
first
,
several
individuals
stated
that
they
believed
the
proposal
would
exempt
department
attorneys
from
ethical
requirements
that
apply
to
all
other
attorneys
,
thus
creating
a
double
standard
.
furthermore
,
they
argued
that
the
proposal
improperly
equated
constitutional
minimums
with
ethical
conduct
.
second
,
several
writers
argued
that
the
attorney
general
did
not
have
the
authority
to
promulgate
such
a
regulation
.
they
argued
that
the
proposal
unfairly
impinged
on
the
traditional
right
of
state
supreme
courts
to
monitor
and
discipline
attorneys
admitted
to
practice
before
them
.
they
also
questioned
whether
the
drafters
of
the
`
authorized
by
law
'
exceptions
could
have
intended
that
the
attorney
general
would
be
empowered
to
release
department
attorneys
from
the
obligations
of
the
rules
simply
by
issuing
a
regulation
.
third
,
several
people
argued
that
the
proposed
regulation
was
not
necessary
for
the
vigorous
enforcement
of
the
law
.
and
fourth
,
several
writers
commented
on
various
aspects
of
the
proposal
itself
.
the
most
common
objection
was
to
the
`
controlling
individual
'
test
that
the
proposal
used
to
determine
whether
communications
with
a
particular
employee
of
a
represented
corporation
would
be
permissible
.
they
argued
that
the
test
was
much
too
narrow
and
would
only
apply
to
a
corporations
general
counsel
and
a
small
handful
of
very
senior
executives
.
the
department
has
reviewed
,
analyzed
and
carefully
considered
all
the
comments
it
received
and
has
made
substantial
revisions
to
its
earlier
proposal
based
on
these
comments
.
the
department
believes
the
current
proposal
,
in
combination
with
the
proposed
additions
to
the
united
states
attorneys
'
manual
,
appropriately
addresses
the
concerns
of
the
commenters
critical
of
the
earlier
proposal
,
while
preserving
the
departments
ability
to
enforce
federal
laws
.
due
to
the
significant
nature
of
the
changes
made
,
the
department
determined
that
an
additional
comment
period
is
appropriate
.

and

this

from
the

published
earlier
.
it
does
,
however
,
include
additional
discussion
regarding
the
purpose
of
the
rule
.
the
attorney
generals
authority
to
establish
standards
of
conduct
for
department
of
justice
attorneys
derives
from
two
distinct
sources
:
section
301
of
title
5
,
united
states
code
,
and
title
28
of
the
united
states
code
,
which
,
through
a
variety
of
provisions
,
authorizes
the
attorney
general
and
the
department
of
justice
to
enforce
federal
law
.
section
301
states
that
`
the
head
of
an
executive
department
or
military
department
may
prescribe
regulations
for
the
government
of
his
department
,
the
conduct
of
its
employees
,
[
and
]
the
distribution
and
performance
of
its
business
'
authority
to
promulgate
this
rule
also
is
implicit
in
the
attorney
generals
statutory
power
to
`
supervise
all
litigation
'
to
which
the
united
states
is
a
party
and
to
direct
united
states
attorneys
and
other
subordinate
attorneys
in
the
`
discharge
of
their
respective
duties
'
28
usc
.
519
.
other
specific
statutory
references
are
indicated
in
the
text
of
the
rule
.
section
772
definitions
this
section
is
substantially
similar
to
the
definitional
section
of
the
previous
proposal
.
two
changes
,
however
,
are
worthy
of
attention
:
`
attorney
for
the
government
'
first
,
the
definition
of
`
attorney
for
the
government
'
has
been
refined
explicitly
to
exclude
from
the
definition
those
law
enforcement
agents
employed
by
the
department
of
justice
who
are
also
members
of
state
bars
,
if
they
are
employed
as
,
and
are
performing
the
function
of
,
agents
rather
than
attorneys
.
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
,
drug
enforcement
agency
and
other
investigative
agencies
have
long
recruited
individuals
with
advanced
degreesincluding
,
for
example
,
engineering
,
business
and
law
degreesto
serve
as
agents
.
the
department
strongly
encourages
the
recruitment
of
educated
and
specially
trained
individuals
for
positions
as
agents
.
an
agents
bar
membership
should
not
adversely
affect
his
or
her
ability
to
conduct
comprehensive
investigations
and
otherwise
to
fulfill
his
or
her
law
enforcement
functions
.
therefore
,
the
proposed
rule
specifically
exempts
attorneyagents
attorney
agents
from
its
scope
if
they
are
employed
by
the
government
as
investigative
agents
and
not
as
attorneys
.
