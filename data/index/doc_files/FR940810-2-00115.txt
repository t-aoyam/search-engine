ownership
interests
in
a
broker
dealer
several
commentators
asked
for
advice
on
when
passive
investors
who
are
limited
partners
,
equity
owners
or
subordinated
lenders
of
a
broker
dealer
would
be
construed
as
associated
persons
under
the
interpretation
.
in
other
words
,
what
ownership
or
contribution
percentage
would
trigger
associated
person
status
.
the
nasd
believes
that
if
the
person
owns
or
has
contributed
10
%
or
less
to
the
firms
capital
,
does
not
receive
hot
issues
from
the
member
in
which
he
has
the
interest
,
and
that
member
is
not
in
a
position
to
direct
hot
issues
to
the
investor
,
then
the
nasd
should
not
construe
the
investor
to
be
an
associated
person
solely
by
virtue
of
the
investment
in
the
broker
dealer
.

restricted
persons
several
commentators
asked
whether
managers
advisors
of
hedge
funds
,
investment
partnerships
or
of
other
similar
entities
would
be
construed
as
a
restricted
person
under

(
sales
to
the
senior
officer
of
a

,
investment
company
or

.
the
nasd
believes
that
managers
of
investment
partnerships
or
corporations
,
hedge
funds
,
and
other
similar
accounts
are
clearly
involved
with
the
buying
or

of

for
an

and
,
as
such
,
are
restricted
under

of

private
placements
several
commentators
sought
advice
on
how
the
interpretation
should
be
applied
to
members
who
receive
securities
of
an
issuer
in
a
private
placement
.
the
definition
of
`
public
offering
'
as
currently
set
forth
in
the
interpretation
is
comprehensive
.
the
definition
includes
all
distributions
`
*
*
*
*
*
of
securities
whether
underwritten
or
not
;
whether
registered
,
unregistered
or
exempt
from
registration
under
the
securities
act
of
1933
,
and
whether
they
are
primary
or
secondary
distributions
,
including
intrastate
distributions
and
regulation
a
issues
,
which
sell
at
an
immediate
premium
,
in
the
secondary
market
'
as
such
,
the
definition
by
its
terms
covers
these
private
placements
.
such
distributions
may
involve
securities
which
are
either
registered
or
unregistered
.
the
nasd
believes
that
the
definition
of
public
offering
is
unnecessarily
broad
and
does
not
believe
that
the
interpretation
should
cover
traditional
`
private
placements
'
of
unregistered
securities
.
thus
,
the
nasd
has
proposed
a
definition
of
a
public
offering
consistent
with
the
definition
provided
in
schedule
e
to
the
associations
bylaws
by
laws
.
issuer
directed
exemption
several
commentators
requested
that
employees
of
an
issuer
or
the
issuers
parent
who
are
restricted
persons
be
exempt
from
the
interpretation
when
purchasing
shares
of
their
employer
or
its
parent
.
currently
,
such
exemptions
can
only
be
granted
on
a
casebycase
case
by
case
basis
by
the
nasd
board
of
governors
.
the
nasd
agrees
that
the
issuer
directed
share
exemption
should
be
modified
to
allow
restricted
employees
to
purchase
under
the
same
terms
and
conditions
as
employees
of
member
firms
do
under
schedule
e
of
the
bylaws
by
laws
,
thereby
eliminating
the
need
for
applications
to
the
nasd
