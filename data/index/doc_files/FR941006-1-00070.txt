section
90046
contains
rules
governing
expenditures
for
transportation
and
other
services
provided
to
media
and
secret
service
personnel
by
presidential
campaign
committees
receiving
public
financing
for
the
general
election
.
section
90346
is
a
parallel
provision
governing
primary
committees
that
receive
public
funds
from
the
matching
payment
account
.
these
provisions
indicate
that
expenditures
for
these
purposes
will
,
in
most
cases
,
be
regarded
as
qualified
campaign
expenses
subject
to
the
overall
limitations
of
sections
90032
and
90351
,
respectively
.
however
,
sections
90046
and
90346
also
allow
committees
to
accept
limited
reimbursement
for
these
expenses
from
the
media
,
and
deduct
any
reimbursements
received
from
the
amount
of
expenditures
subject
to
the
overall
expenditure
limitation
.
these
rules
set
limits
on
the
amount
of
reimbursement
that
a
committee
can
accept
,
and
require
committees
to
repay
a
portion
of
any
reimbursement
that
exceeds
those
limits
to
the
treasury
.
the
proposed
rules
seek
to
clarify
the
application
of
sections
90046
and
90346
by
reorganizing
them
without
any
substantive
change

has
been
inserted
in
order
to
clarify
the
interplay
between
two
aspects
of
the
existing
rules
:
the
requirement
that
the
committee
return
to
the
media
representative
that
portion
of
any
reimbursement
received
that
exceeds
the
actual
cost
of
the
transportation
and
services
provided
by
more
than

,
and
the
requirement
that
the
committee
repay
to
the
treasury
any
part
of
the
reimbursements
it
receives
that
exceeds
the
actual
and
administrative
costs
incurred
by
the
committee

the
commission
seeks
comments
on
modifying
11
cfr
90047
and
90347
to
address
several
issues
regarding
the
cost
of
campaignrelated
campaign
related
travel
using
government
airplanes
,
helicopters
and
other
vehicles
.
the
current
rules
contemplate
that
for
plane
flights
between
cities
served
by
a
regularly
scheduled
commercial
airline
service
,
the
campaign
must
reimburse
the
appropriate
governmental
entity
for
the
first
class
airfare
,
and
that
this
amount
is
treated
as
a
qualified
campaign
expense
.
new
language
in
section
90047b5i
)
and
section
90347b5i
)
would
specify
that
,
for
travel
by
airplane
,
the
amount
of
the
lowest
unrestricted
nondiscounted
discounted
first
class
commercial
airfare
available
for
the
time
traveled
is
to
be
used
.
discounted
fares
that
are
subject
to
restrictions
on
the
dates
and
times
of
travel
,
or
restrictions
on
changing
flights
,
are
not
comparable
to
the
service
provided
when
the
campaign
uses
a
government
conveyance
.
campaign
committees
are
responsible
for
determining
these
amounts
at
the
time
of
the
flight
to
ensure
that
the
right
amount
is
paid
to
the
appropriate
government
entity
,
and
would
need
to
maintain
documentation
supporting
these
amounts
.
the
lowest
unrestricted
nondiscounted
discounted
first
class
airfare
is
available
from
several
sources
including
travel
agents
and
the
official
airline
guide
.
questions
have
also
arisen
regarding
cities
that
are
served
by
regular
air
service
,
but
first
class
flights
are
not
available
.
in
this
case
,
the
commission
proposes
specifying
that
committees
should
use
the
lowest
unrestricted
nondiscounted
discounted
coach
fare
available
for
the
time
traveled
.
this
approach
is
consistent
with
the
valuation
method
established
by
the
select
committee
on
ethics
of
the
united
states
senate
for
the
use
of
private
