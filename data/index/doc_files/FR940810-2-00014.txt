price
to
the
price

charged
for
orthoxylene
in
the
month
that
orthoxylene
was
exported
from
the
united

.
based
on
this
comparison
,
we
found
that
pequivens
price
was
greater
than
the
price
of

orthoxylene
.
as
a
final
check
on
the
validity
of
the
single
importation
as
a
benchmark
,
we
averaged

export
prices
(
adjusted
for
freight
and
insurance
as
well
as
the
difference
between
the
spot
and
contract
prices
)
for
the
three
months
in
which
we
had
data
(
one
within
the
poi
and
two
outside
of
the
poi
.
for
the
two
exports
occurring
outside
of
the
poi
,
we
added
the
average
spread
between
spot
and
contract
prices
for
the
poi
to
the
export
prices
because
monthly
data
on
the
difference
between
spot
and
contract
prices
outside
of
the
poi
was
not
available
.
we
compared
the
average
of
the
adjusted
us
.
export
prices
to
the
average
price
pequiven
charged
in
the
same
three
months
and
found
that
pequivens
average
price
was
greater
than
the
average
price
of
the
imports
from

therefore
,
we
find
that
the
gov
,
through
pequiven
,
did
not
provide

at
preferential
rates

we
