the
cdfg
is
conducting
an
extensive
ongoing
program
to
assess
the
abundance
of
predators
in
the

,
remove
predators
by
means
of
gill
nets
and
other
fishing
gear
,
and
investigate
and
evaluate
all
factors
that
are
thought
to

the

opinion
on
longterm
long
term
operation
of
the
cvp

predation
in
the
forebay
by
limiting
the
combined
incidental
take
of
juvenile
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
at
the
state
and
federal
facilities
to
1
percent
of
the
annual
estimated
juvenile
production
.
in
addition
,
implementation
of
specific
measures
contained
in
the
opinions
reasonable
and
prudent
alternative
,
such
as
closure
of
the
delta
cross
channel
and
reverse
flow
criteria
in
the
western
delta
,
is
expected
to
limit
the
diversion
of
juvenile
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
from
the
sacramento
river
and
their
subsequent
exposure
to
predation
in

possibly
clifton

.
the
cdfg
began
a
largescale
large
scale
program
of
stocking
hatcheryreared
hatchery
reared
striped
bass
in
1981
through
the
striped
bass
stamp
program
authorized
that
year
.
approximately
60000
yearling
bass
were
stocked
that
year
,
and
the
program
increased
substantially
in
subsequent
years
.
beginning
in
1984
,
the
program
expanded
to
include
several
private
hatcheries
and
two
state
facilities
.
between
1982
and
1990
,
the
program
raised
and
planted
nearly
3
million
juvenile
striped
bass
.
additionally
,
privately
reared
yearling
bass
have
purchased
and
stocked
by
the
states
department
of
water
resources
and
the
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
as
mitigation
for
fish
losses
at
their
facilities
in
the
delta
.
since
1984
,
the
company
has
purchased
and
stocked
over
25
million
juvenile
bass
,
and
the
state
has
stocked
almost
5
million
juvenile
bass
since
1988
.
several
groups
raised
concerns
in
1992
about
the
possible
effects
of
cdfgs
striped
bass
enhancement
and
management
program
on
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
nmfs
reviewed
cdfgs
proposed
enhancement
program
for
1992
and
recommended
several
changes
,
as
well
as
the
implementation
of
studies
designed
to
assess
the
magnitude
of
striped
bass
predation
on
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
as
a
result
of
these
and
other
concerns
,
cdfg
eventually
decided
to
suspend
the
planting
of
hatcheryreared
hatchery
reared
striped
bass
in
delta
waters
in
1992
.
in
06/19/1993
,
nmfs
requested
that
cdfg
delay
further
release
of
hatchery
fish
as
part
of
its
striped
bass
management
program
,
and
apply
for
an
esa

.
the
inadequacy
of
existing
regulatory
mechanisms
in
the
final
rule
listing
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
as
threatened
(
55
fr
46515
,
11/05/1990
,
nmfs
concluded
that
the
existing
regulatory
mechanisms
at
that
time
were
not
adequate
to
recover
the
sacramento
river
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
in
the
proposed
rule
reclassifying
the
species
as
endangered
(

fr

,
06/19/1992
,
nmfs
concluded
that
regulatory
mechanisms
might
not
have
been
sufficient
or
applied
effectively
.
nmfs
believes
that
measures
currently
being
taken
by
federal
agencies
pursuant
to
their
esa
section
7
obligations
will
reduce
adverse
impacts
on
the
species
.
however
,
these
measures
do
not
necessarily
provide
for
the
recovery
of
the
species
,
but
that
the
continued
existence
of
the
species
is
not
likely
to
be
jeopardized
.
further
,
the
adequacy
or
inadequacy
of
these
measures
cannot
be
determined
until
at
least
the
1996
return
of
adult
salmon
.
in
addition
,
nmfs
believes
that
title
xxxiv
of
public
law
102575central
valley
project
improvement
actwhich
was
enacted
by
congress
in
late
1992
will
also
contribute
to
the
restoration

recovery
of
the
winterrun
winter

chinook
salmon
.
although
that
act
is
intended
to
protect

restore
,
and
enhance
all
fishery
resources
and
habitats
in
the
central

the
implementation
of
several
provisions
will
directly
benefit
winterrun

and
aid
in
its
recovery
.
several
of
the
provisions
are
also
expected
to
help

that
nmfs
has
identified
as
necessary
to
avoid
jeopardizing
the
continued
existence
of

winter

ensure
its
eventual
