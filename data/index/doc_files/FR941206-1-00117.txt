this
definition
has
been
in
existence
since

four
years
.
since
that
time
,
the
product
life
cycle
has
decreased
to
about
three
years

industry
spokesmen
state
that
this
figure
is
decreasing
even
more
.
when
microcomputers
are
upgraded
,
the
product
cycle
may
be
even
less

typically
they
are
upgraded
by

internal
computer
equipment
has
little
or
no
market
value
.
in
recognition
of
these
faces
,
the
definition
for
outdated
equipment
is
being
revised
to
shorten
the
time
interval
from
eight
to
six
years
after
the
first
commercial
installation
at
which
point
equipment
no
longer
produced
is
considered
to
be
outdated

applications
software

interfaces
can
impede
the
functional
use
of
a
computer
if
they
do
not
have
