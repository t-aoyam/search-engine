requiring
childresistant
child
resistant
blister
packaging
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drugs
and
supplements
,
as
recommended
by
the
ag
petition
,
is
one
packaging
approach
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
pediatric
ironpoisoning
iron
poisoning
fatalities
.
this
approach
can
be
viewed
as
embodying
three
distinct
packaging
components
:
(
1
)
require
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
;
(
2
)
require
a
specific
type
of
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
(
ie
,
blister
packs
;
and
(
3
)
require
crps
.
fda
recognizes
that
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
provides
certain
packaging
features
that
reclosable
containers
do
not
provide
.
products
packaged
in
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
require
that
the
packaging
be
opened
for
each
individual
dosage
unit
.
the
additional
time
and
effort
needed
to
open
each
unit
restricts
the
number
of
doses
available
for
ingestion
during
the
time
that
a
child
has
access
to
the
package
.
in
contrast
,
a
multidose
dose
reclosable
package
(
ie
,
a
bottle
and
closure
)
allows
a
child
access
to
all
of
its
contents
once
the
closure
is
opened
.
in
addition
,
the
effectiveness
of
childresistant
child
resistant
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
does
not
depend
upon
adults
'
properly
resecuring
a
cap
as
is
the
case
with
reclosable
crps
.
therefore
,
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
of
products
will
contribute
in
a
significant
,
over
and
above
the
protections
provided
by
warning
statements
and
crps
,
to
reduce
childrens
access
to
potentially
fatal
doses
of
product
.
this
tentative
conclusion
is
supported
by
studies
of
the
pediatric
accessibility
of
products
in
different
types
of
conventional
(
ie
,
nonchild
resistant
)
packaging
.
the
results
from
these
studies
show
that
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
,
in
comparison
to
snap
type
and
screw
cap
closure
packaging
,
will
limit
access
to
multiple
doses
of
product
by
young
children

as
noted
above
,
blister
packaging
is
one
type
of
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
.
however
,
fda
does
not
agree
with
the
ag
petitions
contention
that
blister
packaging
is
necessary
to
ensure
the
safe
use
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drugs
and
supplements
.
fda
tentatively
finds
that
requiring
a
specific
type
of
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
may
be
more
restrictive
than
necessary
if
other
types
of
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
accomplish
the
same
objective
.
as
discussed
above
,
other
types
of
conventional
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
provide
a
comparable
length
of
time
for
children
to
open
as
that
required
by
conventional
blister
packaging
.
with
regard
to
the
childresistant
child
resistant
component
of
the
ag
petitions
recommendation
,
fda
notes
that
cpsc
has
established
regulations
that
require
crps
for
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drugs
and
dietary
supplements
in
packages
that
contain
250
mg
or
more
total
iron
(
16
cfr
1700
14
)
and
(
13
.
in
addition
,
cpsc
has
promulgated
regulations
for
performance
standards
to
establish
the
effectiveness
of
crps
(
16
cfr
1700
20
.
fda
finds
that
establishing
crps
standards
for
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drugs
and
dietary
supplements
therefore
would
be
redundant
and
could
place
an
unnecessary
regulatory
burden
on
manufacturers
of
such
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
furthermore
,
requiring
crps
for
all
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
with
30
mg
or
more
iron
per
dosage
unit
would
circumvent
the
intention
of
the
pppa
to
allow
access
by
elderly
and
handicapped
persons
who
are
unable
to
use
such
household
substances
when
packaged
in
compliance
with
crps
requirements
.
therefore
,
fda
is
not
proposing
to
separately
require
crps
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drugs
and
dietary
supplements
.
