removal
of
asbestos
containing
flooring
materials
is
a
class
ii
asbestos
job
.
as
such
,
it
must
be
performed
using
the
operation
specific
controls
set
out
in
paragraph
(
giia
,
or
when
called
for
by
an
`
exposure
assessment
using
`
alternative
'
controls
.
additional
controls
must
be
used
if
the
employer
does
not
produce
a
`
negative
exposure
assessment
'
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
job
,
if
during
the
job
,
there
is
reasonable
belief
that
a
permissible
exposure
level
will
be
exceeded
,
or
if
methods
are
used
which
are
expected
to
result
in
flooring
material
breaking
or
otherwise
removed
in
a
nonintact
intact
state
.
the
required
controls
in
large
part
mirror
those
of
the
proposal
which
were
based
on
work
practice
recommended
by
the
resilient
flooring
covering
institute
(
rfci
.
additional
`
nonaggressive
non
aggressive
'
practices
are
allowed
,
in
response
to
supporting
data
and
to
commenters
such
as
michael
murphy
of
monsanto
who
asked
that
osha
`

*
allow
the
use
of
other
practices
which
achieve
comparable
results

osha
believes
that
these
provisions
are
necessary
and
appropriate
to
reduce
risk
to
workers
who
perform
this
type
of
activity
.
the
relative
level
of
risk
of
removing
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
flooring
was
considered
in
the
rulemaking
.
osha
has
not
classified
asbestos
containing
flooring
as
`
high
risk
'
the
degree
of
risk
from
removing
these
materials
depends
on
the
kind
of
removal
activity
performed
,
and
on
the
condition
of
the
material
.
data
relating
to
flooring
removal
show
overall
lower
levels
than
tsi

surfacing

(

thus
,
epa
recently
included
resilient
floor
covering
,
in
its
lowest
risk
category
(
category
i
nonfriable
friable

.
however
epa
concluded
that
`
if
these
materials
are
in
poor
condition
and
are
friable
or
they
are
subjected
to
sanding
,
grinding
,
cutting
or
abrading
,
they
are
to
be
treated
as
friable
asbestos
materials

the
osha
record
supports
these
findings
.
opinions
of
some
asbestos
abatement
experts
familiar
with
a
range
of
asbestos
removal
projects
agreed
with
the
basis
for
epas
and
oshas
classification
scheme
.
marshall
marcus
stated
that
flooring
removals
,
when
well
conducted
are
likely
to
involve
lower
exposures
than
removals
of
other
types
of
interior
asbestos
containing
materials
;
whereas
mary
finn
emphasized
that
removing
of
flooring
tile
,
because
it
cannot
be
saturated
easily
,
may
,
when
aggressively
removed
,
result
in
significant
exposures
(
see
testimony
of
marshall
marcus
,
tr
.
3794
and
mary
finn
tr
.
3765
.
oshas
approach
of
requiring
those
removal
methods
which
are
unlikely
to
elevate
exposures
was
challenged
by
participants
who
contended
that
methods
for
removing
flooring
cannot
be
determined
at
the
beginning
of
the
project
.
this
might
occur
when
employees
discover
during
the
project
that
flooring
is
resistant
to
removal
.
this
may
be
difficult
to
predict
in
advance
,
as
pointed
out
by
bctd
(

,
citing
testimony
of
asbestos
contractor
and
consultant

marcus

and
others
.
osha
acknowledges
that
such
difficulties
may
occur
.
however
,
as
pointed
out
by
mary
finn
,
many
of
the
variables
contributing
to
exposures
are
available
for
consideration
at
the
inception
of
the
project
;
`
*
*
*
*
*
the
predictability
of
how
aggressive
one
must
remove
floor
tile
varies
from
job
to
job
depending
on
the
age
of
the
particular
materials
,
depending
on
the
wear
that
its
undergone
and
depending
on
the
techniques
that
the
particular
contractor
and
his
workers
might
use
'
(

.
also
,
osha
notes
that
much
of
the
project
data
submitted
show
consistency
in
practices
over
the
entire
project
.
in
cases
where
more
aggressive
methods
are
resorted
to
midjob
mid
job
,
osha
requires
a
`
midcourse
mid
course
correction
'
a
reevaluation
evaluation
of
the
exposure
potential
by
the
competent
person
,
and
the
installation
of
additional
controls
if
the
projection
is
that
the
exposures
will
exceed
the

.
most
`
aggressive
'
techniques
,
such
as
`
shotblasting
shot
blasting
'
may
be
used
only
after
an
evaluation
showed
that
less
aggressive
methods
are
not
feasible
.
even
if
the
evaluation
of
the
`
aggressive
'
method
shows
exposures
will
be
below
the
pel
,
the
employees
must
still
install
critical
barriers
or
otherwise
isolate
the
removal
operation
[
paragraph
(
g4ib2
,
and
employees
must
wear
respirators
.
this
is
required
regardless
of
when
such
`
aggressive
'
methods
were
used
,
at
the
inception
,
or
midway
mid
way
into
a
removal
job
.
specific
`
nonaggressive
non
aggressive
'
control
methods
are
allowed
and
preferred
for
removing
flooring
materials
(
tile
,
sheet
,
and
mastics
)
which
contain
asbestos
and
those
materials
for
which
the
employer
building
owner
has
not
verified
the
absence
of
asbestos
.
the
controls
are
`
nonaggressive
non
aggressive
'
work
practices
,
and
include
the
practices
which
under
oshas
proposal
would
have
allowed
an
exemption
from
the
requirement
to
erect
a
negative
pressure
enclosure
for
flooring
material
removal
(

osha
did
not
propose
to
require
employers
to
assume
that
vinyl
or
asphalt
tile
or
resilient
flooring
was
asbestos
containing
,
although
the
rfci
recommended
that
such
an
assumption
be
made
.
osha
asked
for
comments
on
this
issue
.
several
industrial
hygienists
agreed
that
the
recommendation
should
be
followed
.
for
example
,
david
kirby
,
industrial
hygienist
,
oak
ridge
national
laboratory
,
testified
that
an
ongoing
survey
of
ornl
facilities
showed
that
`
90
percent
of
our
floor
tile
either
contained
asbestos
or
the
mastic
material
thats
used
to
attach
them
to
the
floors
contained
asbestos
'
mr
.
kirby
recommended
that
its
`
prudent
to
*
*
*
*
*
*
assume
that
all
floor
tile
materials
contain
asbestos
,
unless
you
can
prove
the
contrary
*
*
*
*
*
'
(

.
according
to
mr
.
kirby
,
negating
the
presence
of
asbestos
content
in
flooring
material
entails
a
complex
and
expensive
process
;
`
taking
those
materials
,
having
them
ashed
,
using
high
temperature
ashing
techniques
,
and
then
the
residue
could
be
analyzed
by
transmission
electron
microscopy
'
other
evidence
in
the
record
indicated
the
prevalence
of
asbestos
containing
flooring
material
.
an
epa
1988
survey
,
cited
in
the
hei
report
,
reported
that
42
%
of
public
and
commercial
buildings
within
the
us

contain
asbestos
containing
floor
