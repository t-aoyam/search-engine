this
margin
creation
effect
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
basis
for
calculating
both
the
amount
of
tax
included
in
the
price
of
the
foreign
market
merchandise
and
the
amount
of
the
usp
tax
adjustment
include
many
expenses
that
are
later
deducted
when
calculating
usp
and
fmv
.
after
these
deductions
are
made
,
the
tax
included
in
fmv
and
the
usp
tax
adjustment
still
reflect
the
inclusion
of
these
expenses
in
the
bases
.
thus
,
a
margin
may
be
created
that
is
not
dependent
upon
a
difference
between
adjusted
usp
and
fmv
,
but
is
the
result
of
differences
between
the
expenses
in
the
united
states
and
the
home
market
that
were
deducted
through
adjustments
.
this
adjustment
to
avoid
the
margin
creation
effect
is
in
accordance
with
court
decisions
.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
the
application
of
the
usp
tax
adjustment
under
section
772d1c
)
of
the
act
should
not
create
an
antidumping
