the
majority
of
the
commenters
(
primarily
food
manufacturers
)
stated
that
fsis
should
continue
with
its
current
labeling
policy
regarding
mechanically
separated
poultry
that
allows
the
declaration
of
mechanically
separated
poultry
as
`
kind
'
or
`
kind
)
meat
'
when
used
as
an
ingredient
in
a
poultry
or
meat
food
product
.
the
commenters
suggested
that
any
changes
in
the
current
policy
will
have
a
severe
economic
impact
on
both
the
poultry
and
meat
industries
.
many
of
the
commenters
stated
that
,
`
since
there
are
no
health
or
safety
issues
regarding
the
use
of
mechanically
separated
poultry
,
nutrition
labeling
satisfies
the
remaining
issue
of
the
consumers
right
to
know
'
that
mechanically
separated
poultry
is
in
the
foods
they
consume
.
therefore
,
the
majority
of
commenters
supported
continuance
of
the
current
policy
regarding
the
product
name
and
labeling
of
mechanically
separated
poultry
(
eg
,
as
`
chicken
'
or
`
turkey
meat
.
on
the
other
hand
,
a
few
commenters
stated
that
meat
and
poultry
products
should
be
labeled
the
same
as
mechanically
separated
(
species
)
(
mss
.
fsis
must
decide
whether
,
under
its
statutory
authorities
,
consumers
would
be
protected
from
misbranded
and
improperly
labeled
poultry
and
meat
food
products
without
the
separate
declaration
of
mechanically
separated
poultry
by
a
regulated
term
.
the
intent
of
nutrition
labeling
is
to
assist
consumers
in
making
sound
choices
in
terms
of
nutrients
in
the
diet
.
fsis
believes
that
nutrition
labeling
provides
some
of
the
information
about
a
food
that
is
important
to
the
consumer
in
planning
a
healthful
diet
;
however
,
it
does
fully
inform
the
consumer
about
the
ingredients
used
to
formulate
a
food
product
.
rather
,
it
is
the
ingredients
statement
on
the
label
of
a
product
that
is
the
labeling
feature
that
informs
the
consumer
of
the
ingredients
used
to
formulate
a
poultry
or
meat
food
product
.
therefore
,
fsis
believes
that
nutrition
labeling
,
coupled
with
an
ingredients
statement
that
accurately
reflects
the
ingredients
that
are
used
to
formulate
a
product
,
is
necessary
to
protect
the
consumer
from
misbranded
meat
and
poultry
products
,
ie
,
improperly
labeled
meat
and
poultry
products
.
fsis
evaluated
the
comments
that
opposed
the
establishment
of
a
labeling
requirement
for
mechanically
separated
poultry
based
on
the
`
adverse
economic
impact
'
of
identifying
this
product
by
a
specific
product
name
in
the
ingredients
statements
of
products
in
which
it
is
used
as
an
ingredient
,
ie
,
as
`
mechanically
separated
(
kind
'
the
comments
opposing
the
declaration
of
mechanically
separated
poultry
by
a
specific
name
associated
with
a
standard
did
not
fully
elaborate
why
consumers
would
be
concerned
about
its
presence
in
the
products
they
consume
.
it
was
suggested
by
a
few
commenters
that
the
name
suggested
in
the
tentative
position
presented
by
fsis
was
pejorative
and
that
consumers
would
think
that
the
product
they
had
purchased
previously
was
now
formulated
with
another
ingredient
,
and
would
not
purchase
the
product
again
because
it
was
different
or
inferior
.
however
,
fsis
believes
that
such
a
labeling
requirement
is
necessary
in
order
to
fulfill
its
statutory
responsibility
to
protect
consumers
by
assuring
that
the
labels
of
poultry
and
meat
food
products
are
not
false
or
misleading
.
fsis
also
believes
that
its
continued
support
of
the
tentative
position
stated
in
the
03/19/1994
anpr
to
establish
a
standardized
name
for
mechanically
separated
poultry
would
be
consistent
with
past
court
decisions
and
regulatory
actions
regarding
mss
,
a
similar
product
made
from
livestock
,
which
was
determined
to
be
materially
different
than
`
meat
'
consumers
had
the
opportunity
to
provide
views
on
the
importance
of
knowing
that
mss
)
is
an
ingredient
in
their
food
during
rulemaking
actions
on
mss
.
fsis
'
1982
final
rulemaking
on
mss
)
(
47
fr
28214
)
indicates
that
material
differences
in
the
consistency
and
composition
of
mss
)
place
it
outside
the
scope
of
the
product
traditionally
defined
as
meat
(

cfr

(
rr
,
and
that
its
differences
are
such
that
it
should
be
defined
as
a
distinctive
standardized
product
.
thus
,
mss
)
must
be
identified
as
a
distinct
meat
food
product
,
eg
,
`
mechanically
separated
pork
(
or
beef
'
and
labeled
as
such
on
the
products
in
which
it
is
used
as
an
ingredient
(
9
cfr
3172c
)
and
(
f
,
3191
,
and
3195
)
in
order
to
assure
that
the
labeling
of
such
products
is
accurate
and
not
misleading
.
currently
,
products
that
contain
mechanically
separated
poultry
are
marketed
using
trade
names
that
identify
any
poultry
ingredient
they
are
made
up
of
only
by
the
kind
name
of
the
poultry
used
(
eg
,
`
chicken
nuggets
'
and
`
turkey
franks
.
fsis
believes
that
it
is
appropriate
to
allow
these
products
to
continue
to
be
marketed
under
such
names
.
these
names
have
a
long
and
uniform
history
of
use
.
revocation
of
these
familiar
trade
names
may
be
a
disservice
to
consumers
if
they
are
mislead
to
believe
that
the
products
they
have
been
purchasing
have
changed
.
although
these
products
contain
tissues
other
than
whole
skeletal
muscle
tissue
,
fsis
does
not
believe
that
consumers
will
be
mislead
by
trade
names
which
only
include
the
name
of
the
kind
of
poultry
from
which
the
poultry
ingredients
are
mechanically
separated
since
any
mechanically
separated
poultry
ingredients
will
be
clearly
identified
as
`
mechanically
separated
(
kind
'
in
the
ingredients
statement
.
fsis
believes
that
the
ingredients
statement
is
the
appropriate
labeling
feature
to
inform
consumers
of
the
ingredients
used
to
formulate
a
product
.
however
,
fsis
welcomes
comments
on
the
names
under
which
products
containing
mechanically
separated
poultry
are
marketed
.
