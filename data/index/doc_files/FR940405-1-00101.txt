(
presented
in

)
and
oshas
quantitative
risk
assessment
(
discussed
in
detail

to

the
osha
estimates
of
lifetime
risk
of
death
attributable
to
exposure
to
ets
in
the
workplace
range
between
04
and
1
for
lung
cancer
and
between
7
and
16
for
coronary
heart
disease
,
per
1000
exposed
employees
.
oshas
estimate
of
the
attributable
risks
suggest
that
all
baseline
cases
of
lung
cancer
and
coronary
heart
disease
will
be
prevented
due
to
elimination
of
exposure
of
nonsmokers
to
ets
in
the
workplace
.

osha
estimates
that
approximately

97700
