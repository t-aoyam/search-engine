data
on
the
potency
of
the
product
consumed
is
available
for
25
cases
.
in
all
cases
for
which
information
is
available
,
the
product
consumed
contained
at
least
40
mg
of
iron
.
in
the

period
,
there
were
nearly
190
poisonings
reported
that

life
threatening
or
that
resulted
in
permanent
injury
,
and
over
2000
reported
poisonings
requiring
some
form
of
treatment
.
fda
believes
that
most
,
if
not
all
,
such

and
some

can
be
prevented
by
requiring

studies
indicate
that
the
child
is
less
likely
to
consume
the
number
of
dosage
units
that
may
be
fatal
.
although
no
studies
have
attempted
to
directly
estimate
the
value
of
reducing
the
risk
of
death
and
illness
to
children
in
particular
,
many
studies
have
attempted
to
estimate
the
value
of
reducing
these
risks
to
adults
.
most
of
these
estimates
are
based
on
wage
differences
between
high
and
low
risk
jobs
and
,
thus
,
are
derived
from
the
labor
market
decisions
of
middleaged
middle
aged
adults
.
although
these
estimates
cluster
around
a
fairly
small
range
,
$
2
million
to
$
10
million
,
it
is
not
clear
that
these
estimates
are
valid
when
applied
to
children
.
fda
has
used
estimates
of
the
value
of
reducing
risks
to
adults
to
a
level
that
would
avoid
one
statistical
fatality
between
$
15
million
and
$
5
million
in
past
rulemaking
proceedings
,
including
recent
food
labeling
regulations
and
a
current
proposal
to
require
domestic
and
foreign
processors
and
importers
of
fish
and
fishery
products
to
establish
hazard
analysis
critical
control

(

to
prevent
the

that
could
affect
the
safety
of
these

(

.
one
method
of
estimating
the
value
of
reducing
risks
to
children
is
to
adjust
the
value
of
reducing
risks
to
adults
by
accounting
for
the
difference
in
the
number
of
lifeyears
life
years
saved
.
under
this
approach
,
an
often
used
estimate
of
the
value
of
the
risks
to
adults
to
a
level
that
would
avoid
one
statistical
fatality
is
$
5
million
for
a
middleaged
middle
aged
adult
.
if
this
value
does
not
vary
with
life
years
remaining
(
that
is
,
if
we
assume
that
an
infant
is
willing
to
pay
the
same
amount
to
avoid
risk
of
death
as
a
40
-
year
old
would
be
willing
to
pay
and
assuming
the
same
distribution
of
wealth
exists
in
both
age
groups
,
then
$
5
million
is
a
reasonable
estimate
.
if
,
however
,
this
value
does
vary
with
life
years
remaining
,
then
the
corresponding
value
for
reducing
the
risks
to
small
children
would
be
$
11
million
.
fda
will
use
these
figures
(
5
to
11
million
)
to
provide
a
range
of
estimates
.
although
fda
is
using
these
values
in
this
analysis
,
fda
stresses
the
tentative
nature
of
these
estimates
and
requests
comments
on
an
appropriate
method
of
estimating
the
value
of
reducing
risks
to
children
.
the

.
because
all
fatalities
for
which
fda
has
information
resulted
from
ingestion
of
dosage

of
at
least
40
mg
iron
potency

all
three
of
these
options
(
all

30

and
40

would
result
in

in

of
those

,
the

was

.
in
seven
cases
,
the

was

aapcc
data
shows
that
from
1986
through
1992
there
were
nearly
190
reported
poisonings
that
were
life
threatening
or
that
resulted

fda
is
unable
to
predict
the
percentage
of
these
nonfatal
poisonings
which
would
be
prevented
by
substituting
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
for

.
it
is
possible
that
not
all
nonfatal
poisonings
will
be
prevented
because
a
child
can
still
gain
access
to
the
product
.
however
,
he
or
she
will
gain
access
to
fewer
dosage
units
than
if
the
product
is
in
a
bottle
.
fda
requests
comments
on
this
issue
.
using
a
methodology
developed
previously
for
fda
to
value
morbidity
risks
,
fda
is
able
to
estimate
the
value
of
reduced
risk
of
nonfatal
poisoning
.
by
comparing
similar
symptoms
and
medical
interventions
,
the
agency
has
derived
an
estimate
of
the
value
of
preventing
a
nonfatal
pediatric
iron
poisoning
of
$
20000
per
case
.
(
ref
.
37
)
as
stated
previously
,
7
out
of
12
cases
of
nonfatal
poisonings
were
a
result
of
ingestion
of
products
of
potencies
over
60
mg
iron
per
dosage
unit
.
if
this
proportion
can
be
extrapolated
to
the
remaining
cases
for
which
information
is
unknown
,
and
if
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
will
prevent
all
nonfatal
cases
(
at
least
2000
cases
in
7
years
,
then
requiring
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
for
products
of
60
mg
or
more
iron
per
dosage
unit
will
add
approximately
$
35
million
to
the
benefits
over
the
next
20
years
(
discounted
at
seven
percent
.
because
no
nonfatal
cases
for
which
information
is
known
were
a
result
of
ingesting
products
with
potencies
between
30
mg
and
60
mg
iron
per
dosage
unit
,
the
options
of
requiring
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
for
products
with
potencies
of
40
mg
and
30
mg
iron
per
dosage
unit
will
not
add
more
to
the
benefits
than
the
previous
option
.
still
assuming
that
all
nonfatal
cases
can
be
prevented
by
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
,
requiring
packaging
changes
for
all
products
would
result
in
reduced
morbidity
valued
at
$
61
million
over
the
next
20
years
