ozark
asserts
that
the
commissions
order
is
not
at
all
clear
whether
it
is
relying
upon
the
modified
definition
of
`
control
'
to
support
its
decision
here
.
if
the
commissions
decision
rests
at
all
on
`
whether
acting
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
others
'
language
,
ozark
submits
that
the
commissions
decision
is
in
error
.
ozark
argues
that
the
effect
of
the
additional
language
is
to
establish
`
control
'
in
a
1
%
voting
interest
owner
of
a
corporation
.
ozark
asserts
that
the
language
creates
an
irrebuttable
presumption
of
`
control
'
by
anyone
holding
at
least
a
10
%
voting
interest
in
a
corporation
,
contrary
to
the
clear
statement
in
the
balance
of
the
regulation
that
the
presumption
of
control
is
rebuttable
.
ozark
contends
these
two
effects
result
from
the
indisputable
fact
that
any
interest
holder
must
act
with
the
requisite
plurality
in
order
for
any
particular
action
to
be
taken
by
a
corporation
or
a
partnership
.
ozark
states
that
in
its
case
unanimity
is
required
for
most
actions
so
all
partners
must
vote
in
the
affirmative
in
order
for
particular
action
to
be
taken
.
ozark
asserts
that
the
fact
that
unanimity
is
required
,
again
,
does
not
constitute
control
but
,
rather
,
evidences
a
lack
of
control
.
accordingly
,
ozark
submits
that
the
modified
definition
is
inconsistent
with
the
existence
of
a
rebuttable
presumption
,
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
,
and
lacks
any
basis
in
reasoned
decisionmaking
.

ozark
argues
that
the
commissions
definition
of
`
control
'
is
inconsistent
with
the
existence
of
a
rebuttable
presumption
.
we
disagree
.
section
1612
states
that
`
control
(
including
the
terms
`
controlling
'
`
controlled
by
'
and
`
under
common
control
with
)
includes
,
but
is
not
limited
to
,
the
possession
,
directly
or
indirectly
and
whether
acting
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
others
,
of
the
authority
to
direct
or
cause
the
direction
of
the
management
or
policies
of
a
company
.
a
voting
interest
of
10
percent
or
more
creates
a
rebuttable
presumption
of
control
'
25
in
order
no
.
497a
,
the
commission
specifically
addressed
the
issue
of
joint
venture
pipelines
and
stated
that
overlapping
interests
create
an
incentive
to
grant
an
affiliate
preference
.
26
the
commission
applied
the
definition
in
section
1612
to
several
pipelines
that
had
requested
rehearing
,
including
high
island

,
trailblazer

,
northern

company
and
great

company
.
27
in
tenneco
,
the
court
upheld
the
definition
of
control
and
the
way
in
which
the
commission
applied
it
to
northern
border
pipeline
company
.
in
considering
ozarks
petition
for
review
,
the
court
remanded
the
commissions
application
of
the
term
`
control
'
but
not
the
definition
of
the
term
.
thus
,
ozarks
request
for
review
of
the
definition
of
control
is
a
collateral
attack
on

no

<

to
consider
whether
there
is
control
here
,
we
will
review
all
the
evidence
ozark
has
submitted
on
the
issue
.
on
march
10
,
1987
,
ozark
filed
an
application
under
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act
for
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
.
in
that
application
,
ozark
stated
that
it
is
a
partnership
and
submitted
its
partnership
agreement
,
which
shows
that
ozark
is
jointly
owned
by
four
partners
,
28
that
the
partnership
will
be
managed
by
a
management
committee
,
which
will
consist
of
equal
representatives
from
each
partner
,
and
will
be
operated
by
opgc
.
in
addition
,
opgc
selects
the
president
of
ozark
,
who
also
acts
as
the
ceo
and
the
chairman
of
the
management
committee
.
on
07/05/1988
,
ozark
emphasized
that
its
general
partnership
agreement
specifies
that
no
action
may
be
taken
by
the
management
committee
except
by
unanimous
approval
.
on
01/03/1993
,
ozark
presented
,
for
the
first
time
,
a
partial
copy
of
a
corporate
resolution
dated
06/26/1991
.
this
states
that
`
the
president
of
ozark
or
his
designee
is
hereby
authorized
to
execute
interruptible
transportation
agreements
on
behalf
of
ozark
'
because
ozarks
partners
ceded
to
the
president
the
authority
to
enter
into
interruptible
transportation
agreements
,
no
partnership
vote
is
required
.
all
of
ozarks
firm
capacity
is
committed
to
tennessee
gas
pipeline
company
and
columbia
gas
transmission
corporation
.
therefore
,
ozark
claims
that
its
partners
cannot
`
control
'
transportation
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
through
veto
power
.
