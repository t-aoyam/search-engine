table

shows
how
to
determine
if
the
indoor
sample
results
are
significantly
different
from
the
results
taken
outdoors
.
use
this
table
by
following
these
steps
:
(
1
)
take
the
same
number
of
samples
indoors
and
outdoors
.
(
2
)
average
the
results
of
the
outdoor
and
indoor
samples
.
(
a
)
add
the
outdoor
results
together
and
divide
by
the
number
of
samples
taken
.
(
b
)
add
the
indoor
results
together
and
divide
by
the
number
of
samples
taken
.
(
3
)
compare
the
range
of
the
outdoor
and
indoor
samples
.
(
a
)
subtract
the
lowest
sample
result
of
the
outdoor
samples
from
the
highest
result
for
the
outdoor
samples
.
(
b
)
subtract
the
lowest
sample
result
of
the
indoor
samples
from
the
highest
result
for
the
indoor
samples
.
(
4
)
calculate
delta
,
which
is
a
term
derived
by
subtracting
the
difference
between
the
indoor
average
and
the
outdoor
average
and
then
multiplying
that
result
times
2
.
(
5
)
calculate
the
sum
of
the
ranges
.
add
the
outdoor
range
and
the
indoor
range
together
.
(
6
)
calculate
the
test
statistic
.
divide
delta
by
the
sum
of
the
ranges
.
.
(
7
)
compare
the
test
statistic
with
the
second
column
in
the
table
below
.
if
the
test
statistic
is
more
than
the
number
found
in
the
column
,
the
difference
is
significant
.
