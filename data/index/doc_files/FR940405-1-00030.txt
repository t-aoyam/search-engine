supplementary
information
:
on
06/28/1993
,
the
department
of
justice
published
a
proposed
rule
,
to
be
codified
at
28
cfr
part
505
,
establishing
procedures
for
the
assessment
and
collection
of
a
fee
to
cover
the
costs
of
incarceration
for
federal
inmates
.
(
58
fr

)
in
response
to
public
comment
and
for
reasons
of
administrative
management
,
the
department
is
publishing
those
provisions
relating
to
statutory
authority
,
applicability
,
and
establishment
of
the
fee
again
for
notice
and
comment
.
further
provisions
relating
to
the
determination
of
the
average
cost
of
incarceration
have
been
added
to
the
proposed
rule
.
as
an
administrative
measure
,
this
rule
delegates
authority
to
the
director
,
bureau
of
prisons
(
bureau
,
to
promulgate
regulations
for
collecting
the
costs
of
incarceration
for
inmates
committed
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
and
to
collect
such
fees
.
the
provisions
in
the
bureau
of
prisons
regulations
(
for
example
,
procedures
for
exemption
,
waiver
,
or
proration
of
fee
assessment
,
calculation
of
assessment
,
and
payment
and
appeal
procedures
)
will
be
based
upon
the
previously
published
proposed
rule
.
response
to
public
comment
on
the
previously
published
proposed
rule
relating
to
statutory
authority
,
applicability
,
establishment
of
fee
,
the
determination
of
the
average
cost
,
and
administrative
procedure
is
summarized
below
.
response
to
public
comment
relating
to
other
provisions
of
the
previously
published
proposed
rule
will
be
contained
in
the
commentary
for
the
separate
bureau
of
prisons
rule
.
comments
on
the
proposed
rule
were
received
from
seven
individuals
(
a
federal
employee
,
a
law
professor
,
and
five
federal
inmates
.
an
additional
comment
was
received
later
from
one
of
the
original
commenters
purporting
to
contain
the
comments
of
two
additional
federal
inmates
.
one
commenter
was
in
favor
of
the
proposed
rule
,
responding
that
criminal
defendants
should
be
required
not
only
to
pay
the
costs
of
their
incarceration
,
but
also
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
social
and
economic
costs
of
their
crimes
.
the
department
has
carefully
reviewed
the
public
comments
received
concerning
the
proposed
rule
and
has
determined
that
a
revised
rule
should
be
published
for
comment
.
attorney
generals
certification
and
rule
indexing
two
commenters
contested
the
validity
of
the
rule
on
procedural
grounds
.
one
commenter
disagreed
with
the
attorney
generals
certification
pursuant
to
5
usc
.
605b
)
that
the
rule
will
not
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
.
this
commenter
argues
that
the
rule
will
have
a
significant
financial
impact
on
various
inmates
and
their
families
owning
joint
property
or
filing
joint
tax
returns
.
the
attorney
generals
certification
pursuant
to
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
(
rfa
,
5
usc
.
60112
,
is
appropriate
in
this
case
.
under
the
rfa
,
neither
an
inmate
or
the
inmates
family
satisfies
the
definition
of
a
`
small
entity
'
which
is
defined
by
the
act
as
a
`
small
business
'
`
small
organization
'
or
`
small
governmental
jurisdiction
.
5
usc
.

.
further
discussion
of
the
agency
provisions
for
the
amelioration
of
the
potential
hardships
faced
by
certain
inmates
and
their
families
due
to
the
imposition
of
a
fee
for
costs
of
incarceration
will
be
contained
in
the
commentary
for
the
final
rule
to
be
issued
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
.
the
second
procedural
comment
received
made
the
proposition
that
because
the
proposed
rule
was
indexed
in
the
federal
register
under
`
justice
'
rather
than
`
prisons
'
notice
of
the
proposed
rule
may
have
been
improper
.
however
,
this
choice
of
indexing
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
within
the
department
of
justice
and
under
the
oversight
authority
of
the
attorney
general
.
likewise
,
the
rule
was
originating
from
the
attorney
general
and
the
department
of
justice
.
thus
,
the
rule
was
properly
indexed
under
`
justice
'
rather
than
`
prisons
'
and
no
notice
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
were
violated
.
