position
:
we
agree
with
petitioners
.
in
cases
where
a
parent
company
is
an
investment
holding
company
,
it
is
the
departments
practice
to
allocate
a
portion
of
gampa
expenses
incurred
by
the
parent
company
to
the
respondent
under
the
theory
that
the
parents
gampa
expenses
are
incurred
on
behalf
of
the
parents
investment
holdings
.
(

eg
,
final
determination
of
sales
at
less
than
fair
value
:
ferrosilicon
from

(

,

)
since
there
is
no
verified
information
on
the
record
to
support
kts
claim
that
all
gampa
expenses
incurred
by
kts
parent
for
the
benefit
of
kt
were
already
charged
to
kt
and
included
in
the
submitted
gampa
calculation
,
we
adjusted
kts
gampa
to
include
a
proportional
amount
of
its
parents
administrative
costs
based
on
kts
parents
stock
ownership
of
kt
.
additionally
,
we
revised
kts
gampa
expense
computation
to
include
the
omitted
amortization
of
preoperating
operating
expenses
as
recorded
on
the
companys
financial
statements
,
as
well
as
to
correct
for
a
clerical
error
found
at
verification
.

:
petitioners
claim
that
the
production
yields
reported
by
kt
are
inaccurate
and
unrealistic
and
cannot
be
relied
upon
by
the
department
for
its
final
determination
.
kt
argues
that
production
yields
are
irrelevant
because
the
costs
used
for
the
final
determination
are
kts
actual
material
expenses
,
not
standard
costs
.
thus
,
kt
maintains
that
whether
or
not
the
production
yield
used
under
the
standard
cost
system
is
accurate
is
irrelevant
to
the
departments
analysis
.
doc
position
:
the
apparent
unrealistic
production
yields
appear
to
be
generated
from
kts
usage
of
theoretical
production
weights
.
since
this
same
theoretical
weight
was
used
to
convert
production
costs
from
a
unit
of
weight
basis
to
a
unit
of
length
basis
,
the
effect
of
the
apparent
unrealistic
yield
rate
is
offset
.
(

)
therefore
,
no
adjustment
was
deemed
necessary
for
the
final
determination
.

:
petitioners
contend
that
the
stainless
steel
coil
costs
kt
used
in
its
original
response
were
not
consistent
with
information
on
the
coil
invoices
obtained
by
the
department
at
verification
and
,
moreover
,
were
inconsistent
with
the
coil
costs
reported
by
kt
in
its
second
cost
questionnaire
response
.
petitioners
argue
that
the
department
,
therefore
,
should
reject
the
stainless
steel
coil
costs
reported
by
kt
.
kt
argues
that
petitioners
'
claim
that
kt
reported
inconsistent
stainless
steel
costs
is
incorrect
.
kt
asserts
that
petitioners
are
basing
this
claim
on
a
comparison
of
noncomparable
comparable
figures
.
specifically
,
kt
states
that
the
figures
taken
from
exhibit
16
of
its
original
cost
response
are
net
of
all
adjustments
for
work
in
process
,
exchange
gains
,
and
scrap
expense
and
revenue
,
whereas
the
figures
in
the
second
response
include
these
expenses
.
