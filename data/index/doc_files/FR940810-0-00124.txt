in
addition
,
even
an
upfront
front
inspection
rule
must
be
targeted
to
be
productive
.
since
not
all
facilities
contain
asbestos
materials
,
an
attempt
should
be
made
to
designate
those
facilities
and
buildings
where
it
unlikely
that
acm
will
be
found
,
otherwise
the
information
yield
from
inspections
will
be
unconnected
to
worker
protection
.
osha
is
using
a
temporal
cutoff
cut
off
of
1980
for
its
presumption
rule
.
as
discussed
later
,
this
date
was
supported
by
the
record
,
since
buildings
constructed
afterwards
are
much
less
likely
to
contain
even
stockpiled
asbestos
containing
materials
.
in
1975
,
under
the
authority
of
the
clean
air
act
,
epa
banned
the
use
of
sprayapplied
spray
applied
acm
as
insulation
and
the
use
of
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
pipe
lagging
and
in
1978
extended
the
ban
to
all
uses
of
sprayedon
sprayed
on
asbestos
.
in
this
regard
osha
notes
that
the
purpose
of
a
cutoff
cut
off
is
not
to
state
a
date
after
which
it
is
certain
that
no
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
material
has
been
installed
in
buildings
.
rather
,
it
is
to
designate
when
it
becomes
unlikely
that
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
materials
have
been
used
in
construction
.
osha
believes
that
1980
is
a
reasonable
date
for
marking
that
probability
.
as
noted
above
,
employers
and
building
owners
are
still
required
to
investigate
materials
installed
after
1980
when
they
suspect
they
may
be
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
.
as
discussed
above
,
osha
additionally
refined
its
presumption
by
recognizing
two
broad
categories
of
building
materials
as
`
highrisk
high
risk
'
and
thus
that
the
consequences
of
a
false
negative
identification
supported
a
such
materials
be
treated
as
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
unless
reliable
information
showed
the
absence
of
asbestos
.
these
kinds
of
materials
are
tsi

sprayedon

or
otherwise

although
as
noted
the
version
of
an
inspection
rule
urged
by
most
proponents
would
require
inspection
for
all
potential
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
materials
,
some
participants
suggested
an
inspection
requirement
which
would
also
concentrate
on
more
potentially
hazardous
materials
first
.
one
suggestion
was
to
,
first
require
inspection
of
steel
structures
with
sprayed
on
fireproofing
constructed
before
1975
,
next
of
sprayedon

installed
before

.
in
the
agencys
view
,
phasing
in
inspection
requirements
may
provide
less
certainty
and
protection
than
its
presumption
approach
.
requiring
a
`
presumption
'
is
an
immediate
source
of
protection
.
any
inspection
program
takes
time
and
significant
resources
.
additionally
,
if
inspection
of
categories
of
potentially
high
risk
material
are
delayed
under
a
phasedinapproach
phased
in
approach
,
protection
is
denied
pending
the
startup
start
date
.
if
judicial
challenge
is
made
employers
may
hold
back
on
any
inspections
hoping
for
a
court
to
invalidate
the
requirement
.
even
more
importantly
,
evidence
in
the
record
also
indicates
that
inspection
data
sometimes
are
not
reliable
.
in
particular
,
the
westat
report
which
evaluated
a
large
sample
of
school
inspections
under
ahera
,
found
that
although
on
the
whole
inspections
identified
most
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
materials
,
`
highrisk
high
risk
'
surfacing
material
was
unidentified
as
asbestos
containing
in
36
%
of
the
inspections
studied
(
ex
.
1326
p
.
326
.
since
surfacing
material
has
been
found
by
osha
,
based
on
this
record
to
be
a
high
hazard
material
,
osha
is
reluctant
to
rely
on
inspections
alone
to
identify
it
.
a
presumptive
approach
requires
that
material
which
looks
like
sprayed
on
or
troweled
on
surfacing
material
,
be
handled
with
care
,
without
waiting
for
inspections
or
relying
on
the
results
of
inspections
which
may
not
correctly
identify
it
.
the
agency
asked
for
comment
on
its
intention
to
designate
