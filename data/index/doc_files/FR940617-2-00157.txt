public
offerings
are
the
traditional
means
of
selling
a
large
number
of
shares
of
a

company
on
the
market
.
public
offerings
are
regulated
both
by
the

rules
of
the

and
by
the

privatizations
,
which
are
a
particular
kind
of
public
offerings
,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
seller
(
the
state
)
and
of
the
volume
of
capital
involved
(
up
to
several
dozen
billion
francs

transaction
,
can
be
carried
out
with
a
substantial
discount
from
the
last

public
offerings
require
the
following
:
_
approval
of
the
cbv
;
_
the
clearance
of
the
prospectus
by
the
cob
;
_
the
centralization
of
subscription
orders
by

;
in
addition
,
public

offers
are
market
transactions
which
require
a
high
level
of
disclosure
.
in
a
public
offering
,
all
financial
institutions
,
such
as
banks
(
but
also
other
financial
intermediaries
such
as
the
french
national
post
office
and
brokerage
houses
,
can
receive
orders
from
the
public
.
such
orders
are
transmitted
to
the
sbf
where
they
are
centralized

none
of
the
financial
institutions
has
any
influence
over
the
allocation
of
the
shares
.
a
public
offering
may
be
underwritten
on
a
standby
stand
by
basis
.
historically
,
most
public
offerings
,
and
in
particular
those
relating
to
privatizations
,
are
oversubscribed
(
about
2
to
4
times

.
underwritten
offerings
whenever
an
offering
is
sufficiently
large
,
an
underwritten
offering
can
take
place
in
france
and
or
on
an
international
market
.
this
is
particularly
the
case
in
the
context
of
privatization
transactions
.
such
transactions
,
which
use
the
bookbilling
book
billing
method
,
provide
the
banks
leading
the
syndicate
greater
flexibility
when
allocating
shares
to
investors
.
in
the
context
of
an
underwritten
offering
,
the
price
for
the
offering
is
set
based
upon
indications
of
interest
received
from
potential
investors
;
however
,
the
final
price
determined
by
the
lead
managers
cannot
be
less
than
the
price
in
the
public
tender
offer
.
during
the
first
privatization
which
used
this
technique
(

,
the
institutional
investors
who
purchased
shares
in

paid
a
price
8
%
higher
than
that
paid
by
individuals
who
purchased

bought
deals
the
`
bought
deal
'
permits
the
placement
of
a
certain
amount
(
usually
large
)
of
securities
with
certain
institutional
investors
.
this
type
of
offering
,
different
from
a
public
offering
,
can
only
occur
when
it
involves
shares
of
a
listed
company
being
offered
at
the
market
price
or
by
techniques
explicitly
provided
for
in
the
general
rules
of

'
(

,
chapter
iii
of
the
general
rules
of
the
cbv
,
the
price
in
this
case
must
be
between
the
best
purchase
offer
and
the
best
sale
offer
existing
at
the
time
of
the
application

(

of

:
these

permit
the
sale

purchase
of
a
given
amount
of
securities
at
a
price
quoted
on
a
stock
market
the
day
of
the
contract
or
the
day
of
its
term
or
at
the
average
of
the
quoted
prices
between
those
two
dates
.
the
seller
of
securities
places
the
securities
through
a
bank
or
banks
with
institutional
investors
of
such
sellers

.
accordingly
,
the
seller
transfers
the
securities
first
to
the
bank
or
banks
which
have
committed
to
sell
them
to
such
institutional
investors
in
france
or
abroad
.
the
cob
carefully
reviews
this
type
of
placement
in

to
ensure
that
it
is
not
used
to
advantage
unfairly

of
underwriters
during

in
france
,
the
banks
are
the
underwriters
of
securities
.
the
vast
majority
of
french
banks
provide
a
full
range
of
banking
and
securities
services
such
as
brokerage
,
underwriting
and
investment
advisory
services
including
managing
on
a
discretionary
basis
the
portfolios
of
bank
customers
.
however
,
banks
may
not
be
direct
members
of
the
paris
bourse
and
have
to
set
up
separate
subsidiaries
which
will
be
members
of
the
bourse
.
the
french
banks
acting
as
underwriters
typically
continue
to
engage
in
a
range
of
trading
activities
during
a
distribution
.
the
underwriters
may
be
active
in
trading
all
kinds
of
securities
of
the
issuer
or
derivative
instruments
related
to
such
securities
both
in
the
cash
market
and
in
the
options
market

in
these
markets
,
the
underwriters
trade
securities
in
the
ordinary
course
for
their
own

requirements
to
which
they
are
subject

pursuant
to

rules
,
banks
maintain
`
chinese

'
procedures
to
separate
certain
divisions
within
their
respective
organizations

the
main
purpose
of
these
chinese
walls
is
to
ensure
that
confidential
information
held
within
parts
of
the
respective
companies

divisions
does
not
spread
inadvertently
to
other
parts
of

in

under

prohibited
from
purchasing
their
own

either
directly
or
through
a
financial
intermediary
acting
on

in
limited
circumstances

set
forth

are
limited
to

may
not
own

such

may
be
only
to
ensure
the
liquidity
of

to
control
excessive
fluctuations
in

the
company
is
required
to
file
a
copy
of

resolution
authorizing
such
transactions
with
