a

tentative
position

definition

identity

composition
.
fsiss
tentative
position
is
to
prescribe
a
definition
and
standard
of
identity
for
the
finely
comminuted
poultry
product
resulting
from
the
mechanical
separation
and
removal
of
most
of
the
bone
from
attached
skeletal
muscle
and
other
tissue
of
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
which
has
greater
than
06
percent
bone
solids
content
.
while
whole
carcasses
sometimes
are
used
,
the
starting
materials
for
this
type
of
processing
frequently
are
parts
of
carcasses
,
such
as
frames
,
backs
and
necks
,
which
contain
relatively
low
proportions
of
skeletal
muscle
,
or
parts
,
such
as
breast
frames
,
from
which
most
of
the
skeletal
muscle
already
has
been
removed
by
traditional
deboning
techniques
.
this
product
is
commonly
known
in
the
poultry
industry
as
mechanically
deboned
poultry
or
mdp
.
the
changes
under
consideration
would
include
(
1
)
amending
the
federal
poultry
products
inspection
regulations
by
defining
mdp
as
`
mechanically
separated
(
kind
'
or
another
appropriate
term
,
using
limits
for
bone
solids
content
and
bone
particle
size
,
and
criteria
for
protein
quality
,
and
requirements
for
labeling
of
the
product
in
products
in
which
it
is
used
as
an
ingredient
,
and
(

)
amending
the
poultry
products
inspection
regulations
to
require
that
such
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
be
kept
at
temperatures
of
40
degrees
f
or
below
within
2
hours
of
the
deboning
operation
.
the
resulting
product
differs
from
poultry
products
produced
by
traditional
deboning
techniques
in
its
highly
comminuted
and
spreadlike
spread
like
consistency
and
in
its
content
of
bone
and
associated
tissue
,
as
well
as
muscle
,
skin
,
and
fat
.
these
differences
have
a
potential
consequence
for
finished
product
microbiological
quality
and
,
thus
,
for
health
and
safety
.
therefore
,
certain
handling
requirements
may
be
needed
.
in
view
of
the
differences
between
mdp
and
boneless
poultry
derived
by
traditional
methods
(
eg
,
handdeboning
hand

,
it
appears
inappropriate
to
continue
to
include
mdp
within
the
category
of
`
boneless

'
(

instead
,
fsis

consequently
