regardless
of
what
other
changes
might
be
made
,
the
commission
is
considering
whether
the
iar
should
be
made
public
at
the
time
it
is
sent
to
the
committee
.
if
this
were
done
,
the
commissions
`
sunshine
'
rules
might
require
a
public
discussion
of
the
iar
,
unless
the
document
met
other
criteria
requiring
closed
discussion
under
11
cfr
24
.
the
commission
recognizes
that
committees
may
prefer
that
the
preliminary
repayment
calculation
,
which
is
now
contained
in
the
iar
,
not
be
publicly
released
,
because
the
amount
of
the
requested
repayment
may
be
substantially
altered
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
far
or
the
final
repayment
determination
.
on
the
other
hand
,
publicly
releasing
the
iar
could
encourage
committees
to
address
issues
at
an
earlier
point
,
rather
than
waiting
until
the
later
stages
of
the
audit
and
repayment
processes
,
as
now
sometimes
occurs
.
if
the
decision
is
made
to
release
the
iar
,
the
revised
rules
would
note
that
the
repayment
sought
could
be
adjusted
upwards
or
downwards
,
based
on
any
subsequent
information
.
finally
,
the
commission
is
considering
whether
,
in
those
audits
that
lead
to
enforcement
actions
,
the
enforcement
process
should
begin
at
an
earlier
point
,
such
as
by
making
reason
to
believe
findings
when
the
iar
is
issued
.
this
would
permit
the
investigation
to
proceed
concurrently
with
the
audit
and
repayment
processes
,
so
that
the
final
repayment
determination
and
statement
of
reasons
could
be
issued
when
the
enforcement
matter
is
concluded
.
the
commission
already
has
begun
to
initiate
enforcement
actions
at
an
earlier
point
,
in
appropriate
cases
.
however
,
it
may
prove
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
formulate
a
specific
policy
that
would
apply
equitably
to
all
audits
as
to
when
the
enforcement
process
should
begin
and
when
it
should
be
completed
.
the
commission
would
not
want
the
completion
of
the
audit
and
repayment
processes
to
be
delayed
because
the
enforcement
action
is
still
underway
.
also
,
in
some
situations
,
it
may
not
be
possible
for
the
commission
to
open
an
enforcement
matter
before
it
issues
a
final
repayment
determination
,
if
that
determination
constitutes
the
commissions
earliest
analysis
of
whether
certain
actions
may
constitute
violations
.
thus
the
current
casebycase
case
by
case
approach
may
prove
to
be
the
best
alternative
.

the
commission
also
has
prepared
new
sections
90077
and
90387
to
explain
which
documents
constitute
the
administrative
record
for
purposes
of
judicial
review
of
final
determinations
regarding
candidate
certification
,
eligibility
,
ineligibility
,
and
repayment
.
for
example
,
the
administrative

includes
documents

other
supporting
evidence
on

the

is

and
the

on
the
other
hand
,
the
commission
has
never
considered
the
administrative
record
to
include
documents
in
the
files
of
individual
commissioners
,
or
documents
in

'
files
which
do
not
constitute
a
basis
for

.
it
would
also
not
be
appropriate
to
include
in
the
administrative
record
transcripts
or
tapes
of
commission
discussions
of
audit
or
repayment
matters
.
although
these
materials
may
sometimes
be
made
available
under
the
freedom
of
information
and
government
in
the
sunshine
acts
,
they
do
not
provide
an
adequate
explanation
of
the
reasons
for
the
commissions
decisions
because
they
represent

the
commission
welcomes

that
