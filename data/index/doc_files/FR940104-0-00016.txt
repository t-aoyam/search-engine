world
.
tenneco
states
that
item
nos
.
7
and
8
require
that
a
pipeline
report
the
position
of
its
marketing
affiliate
in
the
pipelines
transportation
queue
and
the
total
number
of
requests
in
the
queue
respectively
.
tenneco
submits
that
in
the
unbundled
world
pipelines
will
allocate
available
capacity
among
requesting
shippers
not
on
a
firstcome
first
come
,
firstserved
first
served
basis
,
but
on
the
basis
of
the
relative
value
of
the
request
to
the
pipeline
.
tenneco
states
that
the
value
of
the
requests
for
transportation
will
involve
a
calculation
based
on
the
price
offered
and
the
term
of
the
request
,
and
the
precise
method
of
determining
which
offer
has
the
highest
value
to
the
pipeline
will
be
stated
in
the
pipelines
tariff
.
tenneco
asserts
that
without
a
firstcome
first
come
,
firstserved
first
served
queue
in
effect
,
there
is
no
advantage
to
be
gained
by
maintaining
these
two
information
requirements
.
tenneco
further
asserts
that
the
pipeline
capacity
release
programs
will
provide
yet
another
avenue
through
which
shippers
desiring
firm
transportation
capacity
can
obtain
it
,
thus
further
reducing
the
utility
of
the
required
information
.
tenneco
contends
that
these
changes
brought
about
by
order
no
.
636
will
thus
eliminate
the
need
for
pipelines
to
report
the
queue
position
of
their
marketing
affiliates
and
the
total
number
of
requests
in
the
queue
.
tenneco
states
that
item
nos
.
23
and
24
require
pipelines
to
report
whether
or
not
the
pipeline
will
receive
takeorpay
take
or
pay
credits
for
transporting
an
affiliates
gas
and
what
percentage
of
the
gas
transported
will
be
subject
to
credit
.
tenneco
states
that
because
the
commissions
takeorpay
take
or
pay
crediting
program
terminated
on
12/31/1990
,
pipelines
have
not
been
able
to
receive
takeorpay
take
or
pay
credits
since
12/31/1990
.
therefore
,
tenneco
asserts
that
maintaining
this
requirement
serves
no
purpose
.
tenneco
states
that
item
no
.
32
requires
pipelines
to
identify
the
location
of
the
producing
fields
from
which
gas
requested
to
be
transported
for
an
affiliate
originates
.
tenneco
argues
that
with
the
implementation
of
flexible
receipt
and
delivery
points
and
capacity
release
,
this
information
becomes
useless
.
tenneco
contends
that
shippers
will
be
using
secondary
receipt
points
on
their
own
contracts
and
acquiring
each
others
capacity
much
more
than
they
have
historically
.
tenneco
asserts
that
this
is
precisely
the
outcome
that
the
commission
is
trying
to
bring
about
by
mandating
flexible
receipt
and
delivery
points
and
capacity
release
.
tenneco
submits
that
with
this
increase
in
the
number
of
transportation
transactions
that
involve
the
use
of
points
other
than
the
primary
receipt
or
delivery
point
of
the
entity
requesting
transportation
,
requiring
pipelines
to
report
this
information
serves
no
purpose
.
tenneco
states
that
record
no
.
3
requires
pipelines
to
report
requested
receipt
and
delivery
points
for
transportation
requests
of
their
marketing
affiliates
.
tenneco
asserts
that
the
advent
of
flexible
receipt
and
delivery
points
renders
this
information
useless
.
tenneco
argues
that
the
marketing
affiliate
,
like
any
other
shipper
,
will
have
the
firm
right
to
use
any
receipt
or
delivery
point
on
the
system
to
the
extent
that
capacity
is
available
.
thus
,
tenneco
contends
the
utility
of
maintaining
a
list
of
requested
receipt
and
delivery
points
is
vastly
diminished
.
because
the
information
required
by
item
nos
.
7
,
8
,
23
,
24
,
and
32
of
schedule
2
and
all
of
schedule
3
will
no
longer
have
value
after
full
compliance
with
order
no
.
636
,
tenneco
requests
that
the
commission
clarify
that
this
information
need
not
be
maintained
on
pipelines
'
ebbs
.
tenneco
asserts
that
eliminating
the
requirement
to
report
it
is
consistent
with
the
commissions
goal
to
decrease
needlessly
burdensome
regulation
.
tenneco
requests
expedited
action
on
this
issue
as
pipelines
are
currently
setting
up
their
ebbs
,
and
a
swift
affirmative
response
will
enable
the
new
ebbs
to
more
accurately
reflect
the
required
information
.
