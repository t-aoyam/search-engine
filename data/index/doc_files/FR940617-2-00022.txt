in
accordance
with
the
cit
decision
in
federalmogul
federal

,
we
have
multiplied
the
foreign
market
tax
rate
by
the
price
of
the
united
states
merchandise
at
the
same
point
in
the
chain
of
commerce
that
the
foreign
market
tax
was
applied
to
foreign
market
sales
,
and
have
added
the
product
to
the
usp
.
we
have
also
deducted
from
the
usp
and
the
fmv
those
portions
of
the
respective
home
market
tax
and
the
usp
tax
adjustments
attributable
to
expenses
included
in
the
foreign
market
and
united
states
bases
of
the
tax
if
those
expenses
are
later
deducted
to
calculate
fmv
and
usp
.
these
adjustments
to
the
foreign
market
tax
and
the
usp
tax
adjustment
are
necessary
to
prevent
the
methodology
for
calculating
the
usp
tax
adjustment
from
creating
antidumping
duty
margins
where
no
margins
would
exist
if
no
taxes
were
levied
upon
foreign
market
sales
.
this
margin
creation
effect
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
basis
for
calculating
both
the
amount
of
tax
included
in
the
price
of
the
foreign
market
merchandise
and
the
amount
of
the
usp
tax
adjustment
include
many
expenses
that
are
later
deducted
when
calculating
usp
and
fmv
.
after
these
deductions
are
made
,
the
tax
included
in
fmv
and
the
usp
tax
adjustment
still
reflect
the
inclusion
of
these
expenses
in
the
bases
.
thus
,
a
margin
may
be
created
that
is
not
dependent
upon
a
difference
between
adjusted
usp
and
fmv
,
but
is
the
result
of
differences
between
the
expenses
in
the
united
states
and
the
home
market
that
were
deducted
through
adjustments
.
