but
did
not

control
for

accordingly
,
the

has
found
that
the
credible
evidence
against
an

between
respiratory

and
herbicide

outweighs
the
credible
evidence
for
such
an

exposure
to

is
also
a
risk
factor

;
smoking

increase
the

there

evidence
that

most

(

showed
increased
risk
associated
with
herbicide
exposure
;
however
,
that
risk
was
not
statistically
significant
,
which
diminishes
the
importance
of
these
studies
.
accordingly
,
the
secretary
has
found
that
the
credible
evidence
against
an
association
between
nasal
nasopharyngeal
cancers
and
herbicide
exposure
outweighs
the
credible
evidence
for
such
an
association
,
and
he
has
determined
that
a
positive
association
does
not
exist
.
nas
also
reviewed
the
literature
with
respect
to
possible
associations
between
herbicide
exposure
and
various
reproductive
effects
,
ie
,
spontaneous
abortion
,
birth
defects
,
neonatal
infant
deaths
and
stillbirths
,
low
birth
weight
,
and
childhood
cancers
in
offspring
.
these
reproductive
effects
were
categorized
by
nas
as
health
outcomes
with
inadequate
insufficient
evidence
to
determine
whether
an
association
exists
because
the
studies
were
of
inadequate
statistical
power
for
specific
birth
defects
,
contained
a
limited
sample
size
,
and
or
failed
to
exclude
bias
and
chance
.
it
should
be
noted
that
to
compensate
a
veteran
for
these
conditions
is
beyond
vas
authority
(
see
title
38
,
usc
)
and
would
require
enabling
legislation
.
nas
assigns
four
diseases
or
categories
of
diseases
to
a
category
labeled
limited
suggestive
evidence
of
no
association
with
herbicide
exposure
which
it
defined
as
meaning
that
several
adequate
studies
,
covering
the
full
range
of
levels
of
exposure
that
humans
are
known
to
encounter
,
are
mutually
consistent
in
not
showing
a
positive
association
between
herbicide
exposure
and
the
particular
health
outcome
at
any
level
of
exposure
.
the
conditions
include
skin
cancer
,
gastrointestinal
tumors
(
stomach
cancer
,
pancreatic
cancer
,
colon
cancer
,
and
rectal
cancer
,
bladder
cancer
,
and
brain
tumors
.
there
were
many
credible
studies
(
see
nas
report
,
chapter
8
)
concerning
all
of
these
conditions
that
showed
no
association
or
a
negative
association
with
herbicide
exposure
.
accordingly
,
the
secretary
has
found
that
there
is
no
credible
evidence
for
an
association
between
skin
cancer
,
gastrointestinal
tumors
(
stomach
cancer
,
pancreatic
cancer
,
colon
cancer
,
and
rectal
cancer
,
bladder
cancer
,
and
brain
tumors
and
herbicide
exposure
,
and
he
has
determined
that
a
positive
association
does
not
exist
.
nas
reviewed
approximately
6420
abstracts
of
scientific
or
medical
articles
as
an
integral
part
of
the
process
that
resulted
in
its
report
,
entitled
`
veterans
and
agent
orange
:
health
effects
of
herbicides
used
in
vietnam
'
from
these
articles
,
approximately
230
epidemiologic
studies
,
including
studies
of
people
exposed
to
herbicides
in
occupational
and
environmental
settings
as
well
as
studies
of
vietnam
veterans
,
were
chosen
for
detailed
review
and
analysis
.
in
our
judgment
,
the
comprehensive
review
and
evaluation
of
the
available
literature
which
nas
conducted
in
conjunction
with
its
report
has
permitted
us
to
identify
all
conditions
for
which
the
current
body
of
knowledge
supports
a
finding
of
an
association
with
herbicide
exposure
.
accordingly
,
the
secretary
has
determined
that
there
is
no
positive
association
between
exposure
to
herbicides
and
any
other
condition
for
which
he
has
not
specifically
determined
that
a
presumption
of
service
connection
is
warranted
