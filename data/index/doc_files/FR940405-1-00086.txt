preliminary

introduction
executive
order
12886
requires
a
regulatory
impact
analysis
and
regulatory
flexibility
analysis
to
be
prepared
for
any
regulation
that
meets
the
criteria
for
a
`
significant
regulatory
action
'
one
of
these
criteria
,
relevant
to
this
rulemaking
is
that
the
rule
have
an
effect
on
the
economy
of
$
100
million
or
more
per
year
.
based
upon
the
preliminary
analysis
presented
below
,
osha
finds
that
the
proposed
standard
will
constitute
a
significant
regulatory
action
.
the
estimates
presented
in
this
phase
1
preliminary
regulatory
impact
analysis
demonstrate
technological
and
economic
feasibility
of
the
proposed
standard
.
the
analysis
provides
a
nondetailed
detailed
preliminary
count
of
the
affected
employees
and
buildings
,
the
associated
costs
,
and
benefits
of
the
proposed
standard
provisions
.
osha
estimates
the
annual
cost
of
compliance
with
the
iaq
standard
to
be
$
81
billion
,
of
which
the
most
costly
provision
will
be
for
the
building
systems
operation
and
maintenance
,
$
8
billion
.
the
cost
for
eliminating
exposure
to
ets
may
range
from
$
0
to
$
68
million
depending
on
whether
establishments
ban
smoking
or
allow
smoking
in
designated
areas
.
in
order
to
assess
the
overall
economic
impact
of
the
rule
,
osha
also
estimated
the
cost
savings
to
employers
,
or
cost
savings
that
will
result
from
the
implementation
of
the
proposed
standard
.
the
major
forms
of
these
savings
are
efficiency
and
productivity
improvements
,
cost
reductions
in
operations
and
maintenance
,
and
reduced
incidence
of
property
damage
.
cost
savings
associated
with
productivity
improvements
are
estimated
to
be
$
15
billion
annually
.
osha
preliminarily
estimates
that
the
proposed
standard
will
prevent
3
million
severe
headaches
and
45
million
upper
respiratory
symptoms
over
the
next
45
years
.
this
is
,
approximately
,
69000
severe
headaches
and
105000
upper
respiratory
symptoms
per
year
.
these
estimates
understate
the
prevalence
of
buildingrelated
building
related
symptoms
since
they
reflect
excess
risk
in
only
air
conditioned
buildings
.
in
addition
,
5583
to
32502
lung
cancer
deaths
and
97700
to
577818
coronary
heart
disease
deaths
related
to
occupational
exposure
to
ets
will
be
prevented
over
the
next
45
years
.
this
represents
140
to
722
lung
cancer
deaths
per
year
and
2094
to
13001
heart
disease
deaths
per
year
.

industry
profile
the
environmental
concern
for
air
pollution
has
been
largely
focussed
on
questions
of
outdoor
air
contamination
.
recently
,
however
,
attention
has
begun
to
shift
to
concerns
about
the
quality
of
air
within
buildings
since
people
spend
80

90
percent
of
their
time
indoors

indoor
air
is
a
variable
complex
mixture
of
chemicals
and
airborne
particles
.
its
composition
largely
depends
on
the
outdoor
environment
(
urban
or
rural
area
,
the
shelter
itself
(
age
,
construction
material
,
electric
equipment
,

and
ventilation
systems
,
the
activities
of
the
occupants
(
smoking
,
nonsmoking
,
cooking
by
gas
,

or

)
and
the
presence
of
plants
and

characterizes
the

the
factors
that
affect

.
this
section
also

of
employees
who
work
in

whose
indoor
air
will
be

by
the

the
standard
covers
all

.
the
scope
of
the
proposal
is
twofold
.
the
proposed
indoor

quality
compliance
provisions
would
only
cover

with
nonindustrial
industrial
work
environments

this
includes

healthcare
facilities

areas

also
applies
to
nonindustrial
work
environments
that
are
part
of
industrial
worksites
(
eg
,
an
office
,
cafeteria
,
or
break
room
located
at
a
manufacturing
facility
.
the
provisions
for
protecting
the
nonsmoking
employees
from
exposure
to
ets
apply
to
all
indoor
or
enclosed
work
environments
,
in
industrial

this
