summary
:
by
this
notice
,
the
occupational
safety
and
health
administration
(
osha
)
proposes
to
adopt
standards
addressing
indoor
air
quality
in
indoor
work
environments
.
the
basis
for
this
proposed
action
is
a
preliminary
determination
that
employees
working
in
indoor
work
environments
face
a
significant
risk
of
material
impairment
to
their
health
due
to
poor
indoor
air
quality
,
and
that
compliance
with
the
provisions
proposed
in
this
notice
will
substantially
reduce
that
risk
.
the
provisions
of
the
standard
are
proposed
to
apply
to
all
indoor
`
nonindustrial
work
environments
'
in
addition
,
all
worksites
,
both
industrial
and
nonindustrial
within
oshas
jurisdiction
are
covered
with
respect
to
the
proposed
provisions
addressing
control
of
environmental
tobacco
smoke
.
the
proposal
would
require
affected
employers
to
develop
a
written
indoor
air
quality
compliance
plan
and
implement
that
plan
through
actions
such
as
inspection
and
maintenance
of
building
systems
which
influence
indoor
air
quality
.
provisions
under
the
standard
also
propose
to
require
employers
to
implement
controls
for
specific
contaminants
and
their
sources
such
as
outdoor
air
contaminants
,
microbial
contamination
,
maintenance
and
cleaning
chemicals
,
pesticides
,
and
other
hazardous
chemicals
within
indoor
work
environments
.
designated
smoking
areas
which
are
to
be
separate
,
enclosed
rooms
exhausted
directly
to
the
outside
are
proposed
to
be
required
in
buildings
where
the
smoking
of
tobacco
products
is
not
prohibited
.
specific
provisions
are
also
proposed
to
limit
the
degradation
of
indoor
air
quality
during
the
performance
of
renovation
,
remodeling
and
similar
activities
.
provisions
for
information
and
training
of
building
system
maintenance
and
operation
workers
and
other
employees
within
the
facility
are
also
included
in
this
notice
.
finally
,
proposed
provisions
in
this
notice
address
the
establishment
,
retention
,
availability
,
and
transfer
of
records
such
as
inspection
and
maintenance
records
,
records
of
written
compliance
programs
,
and
employee
complaints
of
buildingrelated
building
related
illness
.
the
agency
invites
the
submission
of
written
data
,
views
and
comments
on
all
regulatory
provisions
proposed
in
this
notice
,
and
on
all
relevant
issues
pertinent
to
those
provisions
.
osha
is
also
scheduling
an
informal
public
hearing
where
persons
may
orally
submit
their
views
.
it
is
noted
here
that
subsequent
federal
register
notices
may
be
published
subsequent
to
this
notice
,
if
the
public
presents
views
leading
to
a
substantial
change
in
focus
or
it
is
otherwise
determined
to
be
appropriate
.
