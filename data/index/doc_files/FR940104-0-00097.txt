in

provided
in

and
an

integrated

plans
.
(
a1
)
an
rea

irp
is
required
for
all

that
include
funds
for
dsm
activities
,
unless
the
cumulative
total
of
all
previous
dsm

under

is
less
than
1
percent

.
(

an

irp
is
required
for
all

on
grid
renewable
energy
systems
.
(

)
an

irp
is
required
for
all
loans
that
include
funds
for
offgrid
off
grid
renewable
energy
systems
unless
the

is
both
feasible
and
secure
pursuant
to
§

112
and
1710
113
,
respectively
.
(
b1
)
when
an
irp
is
required
,
a
distribution
borrower
that
is
a
member
of
a
power
supply
borrower
must
use
the
irp
prepared
by
the
power
supply
borrower
for
its
overall
system
.
this
irp
must
have
been
coordinated
with
all
of
the
member
systems
and
it
must
have
been
approved
by
the
board
of
directors
of
the
power
supply
borrower
.
because
of
the
relationship
between
the
power
supply
borrower
and
its
members
under
which
the
loans
incurred
by
the
power
supply
borrower
are
primarily
to
construct
,
improve
or
acquire
facilities
that
benefit
all
members
directly
or
indirectly
,
the
security
of
loans
to
all
parties
is
interlinked
.
consequently
,
dsm
activities
and
renewable
energy
activities
must
be
coordinated
among
all
parties
to
insure
that
the
activities
of
one
member
do
not
jeopardize
the
financial
integrity
or
loan
security
of
any
other
member
or
that
of
the
power
supply
borrower
.
(

)
a
distribution
system
that
is
not
a
member
of
an
rea
financed
power
supply
borrower
shall
prepare
its
own
irp
.
an
irp
developed
by
a
distribution
borrower
that
is
not
a
member
of
a
power
supply
borrower
need
only
address
its
own
system
,
but
shall
include
an
analysis
of
the
effects
of
its
dsm
activities
on
its
wholesale
power
costs
.
(
c
)
the
irp
shall
identify
supply
side
and
demand
side
options
and
analyze
their
benefits
and
costs
in
order
to
provide
adequate
and
reliable
electric
service
to
consumers
at
the
lowest
cost
for
the
system
as
a
whole
.
(

)
the
irp
shall
include
necessary
features
for
system
operation
,
such
as
diversity
,
reliability
,
dispatchability
,
and
other
factors
of
risk
;
and
it
shall
take
into
account
the
ability
to
verify
energy
and
cost
savings
achieved
through
dsm
,
energy
conservation
,
and
renewable
energy
systems
,
and
the
projected
durability
of
such

not
necessary
:
(

ownership
and
costs
of
dsm
related
hardware
;
(

communication
and
control
costs
;
and
(

.
(

the

analyze
the
dsm

dsm
plans
.
(
a
)
a
dsm
plan
approved
by
the
borrowers
board
of
directors
is
required
in
support
of
a
loan
that
includes
funds
for
dsm
activities
or
for
offgrid
off
grid
renewable
energy
systems
.
the
dsm
plan
shall
address
the
borrowers
existing
and
proposed
activities
for
the
same
period
covered
by
the
longrange
long
range
financial
forecast
submitted
in
support
of
the
loan
application
.
(
b1
)
a
dsm
plan
prepared
by
a
member
of
a
power
supply
borrower
must
be
consistent
with
the
irp
prepared
by
the
power
supply
borrower
.
(

)
a
dsm
plan
prepared
by
a
distribution
borrower
that
is
not
a
member
of
an
rea
financed
power
supply
borrower
must
be
consistent
with
the
borrowers
own
irp
.
(
c
)
the
level
of
detail
required
in
the
dsm
plan
is
dependent
on
several
factors
,
for
example
:
(
1
)
size
and
term
of
loan
;
(
2
)
financial
impact
of
loan
on
the
borrower
;
(

)
probability
of
realization
of
the
estimated
impacts
;
