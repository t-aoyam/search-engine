this
paragraph
amends
the
previous
proposal
by
adding
procedural
protections
designed
to
ensure
that
such
waivers
are
in
fact
voluntary
,
knowing
,
and
informed
.
after
a
represented
individual
has
been
arrested
or
charged
in
a
criminal
proceeding
or
is
named
as
a
defendant
in
a
civil
law
enforcement
proceeding
,
the
proposed
rule
requires
that
several
steps
be
taken
before
any
substantive
discussions
take
place
.
first
,
the
government
attorney
must
inform
the
individual
of
his
or
her
right
to
speak
through
his
or
her
attorney
and
to
have
that
attorney
present
for
any
communications
with
the
government
attorney
.
second
,
the
represented
party
must
waive
his
or
her
right
to
counsel
in
such
a
way
as
to
indicate
that
the
waiver
is
voluntary
,
knowing
and
informed
.
if
at
all
possible
,
the
attorney
for
the
government
should
obtain
a
signed
written
waiver
.
third
,
the
attorney
for
the
government
must
bring
the
matter
before
the
appropriate
district
court
judge
,
magistrate
or
other
tribunal
of
competent
jurisdiction
.
the
court
should
be
asked
for
a
determination
:
that
the
waiver
satisfies
the
provisions
of
this
rule
;
or
that
substitute
counsel
is
in
place
and
that
counsel
consents
to
the
communication
;
or
,
in
the
alternative
,
that
it
is
appropriate
for
the
court
to
appoint
counsel
.
the
rule
does
not
,
however
,
require
that
the
waiver
take
place
before
the
judge
or
magistrate
.
in
exceptional
circumstances
,
it
may
be
impractical
or
unsafe
to
bring
the
defendant
before
a
judge
or
magistrate
to
secure
the
waiver
.
in
those
cases
,
the
tribunal
must
determine
in
advance
of
substantive
discussions
,
based
on
the
evidence
before
it
,
whether
the
waiver
was
made
knowingly
,
intelligently
and
voluntarily
.
as
noted
above
,
the
initiation
of
ex
parte
contacts
by
represented
parties
frequently
occurs
in
the
context
of
the
`
fearful
defendant
'
whose
attorney
has
been
chosen
by
a
third
party
,
often
an
individual
above
the
defendant
in
the
criminal
hierarchy
.
such
a
defendant
may
wish
to
cooperate
with
the
government
but
may
fear
that
his
life
or
safety
will
be
endangered
if
his
attorney
learns
of
the
cooperation
.
although
the
need
for
a
mechanism
by
which
a
represented
party
can
initiate
contacts
with
the
government
is
particularly
acute
in
this
context
,
paragraph
(
c
)
is
not
limited
to
this
setting
.
rather
,
the
proper
inquiry
is
whether
the
represented
partys
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel
is
voluntary
,
knowing
,
and
informednot
whether
the
represented
party
has
established
some
overriding
justification
for
his
or
her
decision
.
paragraph
(
d
:
waivers
at
the
time
of
arrest
paragraph
(
c
)
of
this
section
provides
the
general
rule
regarding
how
a
represented
party
may
waive
any
protections
otherwise
provided
under
this
regulation
.
this
paragraph
provides
for
a
more
specific
rule
dealing
with
a
waiver
at
the
time
of
arrest
.
this
paragraph
provides
that
a
government
attorney
may
communicate
directly
with
a
represented
party
without
the
consent
of
that
partys
counsel
at
the
time
of
his
or
her
arrest
if
the
represented
party
has
been
fully
informed
of
his
or
her
constitutional
rights
at
that
time
and
has
waived
them
.
the
government
attorney
need
not
comply
with
any
of
the
additional
requirements
of
paragraph
(
c
)
in
such
a
situation
.
however
,
it
is
generally
prudent
to
obtain
a
written
waiver
at
the
time
of
arrest
if
possible
.
this
exception
is
intended
to
preserve
the
ability
of
government
attorneys
to
interview
individuals
immediately
following
arrest
as
an
effective
and
important
law
enforcement
tool
.
a
substantial
body
of
law
has
developed
regarding
the
postarrest
arrest
waiver
of
various
constitutional
rights
.
the
department
believes
that
the
constitutional
requirements
identified
in
that
decisional
law
adequately
protect
represented
individuals
following
arrest
.
furthermore
,
the
effectiveness
of
postarrest
arrest
interviews
would
be
significantly
curtailed
if
the
procedural
requirements
of
paragraph
(
c
)
applied
.
accordingly
,
this
paragraph
is
intended
to
preserve
this
investigative
tool
without
adding
any
additional
procedural
requirements
.
