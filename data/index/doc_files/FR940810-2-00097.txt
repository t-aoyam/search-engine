environmental

identification
of
the
proposed
action
the
proposed
amendment
will
revise
the
haddam
neck
technical
specifications
(
ts
)
to
allow
an
increased
limit
for
fuel
enrichment
.
the
change
will
allow
the

of

to

the

the
licensee
has
changed
fuel

and
has
ordered

fuel
(
5

u235
)
for
the
upcoming
outage
scheduled
to
start
in
01/19/1995
.
the
ts
change
is
necessary
for
the
storage
of
the
new
and
eventually
used
fuel
in
the
new
and
spent
fuel
storage
racks
.
the
licensee
is

requires

environmental
impacts
of
the
proposed
action
the
commission
has
completed
its
evaluation
of
the
proposed
revision
to
the
ts
.
the
staff
has
concluded
that
the
analysis
methods
used
are
acceptable
and
capable
of
predicting
the
reactivity
of
the
haddam
neck
plant
storage
racks
with
a
high
degree
of
confidence
.
the
licensee
has
analyzed
the
new
fuel
storage
racks
for
three
different
configurations
as
required
by
the
nrc
and
determined
that
the
staff
criteria
are
met

evaluated
by

this

is
predicated
on
the
reactivity

associated
with
the
addition
of

(

,
which
the
staff
has
found
acceptable
in

applications
.

was
used
.
this
analysis
is
predicated
upon
the
reactivity
decrease
associated
with
fuel
depletion
and
has
been
previously
accepted
by
the
staff
for
spent
fuel
storage
analysis
.
the
maximum
keff
of
the
alternating

configuration
was
0

when
combined
with
all
known
uncertainties
and
meets
the
staff
criteria
of

.
the
ts
change
will
not
increase
the
probability
or
consequences
of
accidents
,
no
changes
are
being
made
in
the
types
of
any
effluents
that
may
be
released
offsite
,
and
there
is
no
significant
increase
in
the
allowable
individual
or
cumulative
occupational
radiation
exposure
.
accordingly
,
the
commission
concludes
that
there
are
no
significant
radiological
environmental
impacts
associated
with
this
proposed
ts
amendment
.
with
regard
to
potential
nonradiological
impacts
,
the
proposed
amendment
does
involve
features
located
entirely
within
the
restricted
area
as
defined
in
10
cfr
part
20
.
it
does
not
affect
nonradiological
plant
effluents
and
has
no
other
environmental
impact
.
accordingly
,
the
commission
concludes
that
there
are
no
significant
nonradiological
environmental
impacts
associated
with
the
proposed
amendment
.
the
environmental
impacts
of
transportation
resulting
from
the
use
of
more
highly
enriched
fuel
and
extended
burnup
rates
have
been
discussed
in
the
generic
staff
assessment
entitled
`
nrc
assessment
of
the
environmental
effects
of
transportation
resulting
from
extended
fuel
enrichment
and
irradiation
'
dated
07/07/1988
,
and
published
in
the
federal
register
on
08/11/1988
(

)
as
corrected
on
08/24/1988
(

.
as
indicted
therein
,
the
environmental
cost
contribution
of
the
proposed
increase
in
fuel
enrichment
and
irradiation
limits
are
either
unchanged
or
may
in
fact
be
reduced
from
those
summarized
in
table
s4
as
set
forth
in

.
therefore
,
the
staff
concludes
that
there
are
no
significant
radiological
or
nonradiological
environmental
impacts
associated
with
the
proposed
amendment
.
alternatives
to
the
proposed
action
since
the
commission
has
concluded
there
is
no
measurable
environmental
impact
associated
with
the
proposed
amendment
,
any
alternatives
with
equal
or
greater
environmental
impact
need
not
be
evaluated
.
the
principal
alternative
to
the
amendment
would
be
to
deny
the
amendment
request
.
such
action
would
not
enhance
the
protection
of
the
environment
and
would
result
in
unjustified
cost
to
the
licensee
.
alternative
use
of
resources
this
action
does
not
involve
the
use
of
resources
not
considered
previously
in
the
final
environmental
statement
for
the
haddam

plant

the
state

had
no
comments
.
finding
of
no
significant

based
upon
the
environmental
assessment
,
the
commission
concludes
that
the
proposed

will
not
have
a
significant
effect
on
the
quality
of
the
human
environment

accordingly

the
