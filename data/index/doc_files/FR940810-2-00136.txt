defines
`

'
as

that
is
comprised
of
a
bonded
lens
and

assembly
.
from
08/19/1991
to
12/19/1993
,
the
petitioner
imported
approximately
46000
mercedesbenz
mercedes
benz
vehicles
for
sale
in
the
united
states
in
which
the
headlamps
were
not
`
replaceable
bulb
headlamps
'
because
their
lenses
were
clipped
onto
their
reflectors
as
an
assembly
rather
than
bonded
.

.
mercedes
supported
its
petition
for
inconsequential
noncompliance
with
the
following
.
1
.
damaged
lenses
will
be
replaced
with
complying
headlamp
assemblies
based
on
the
number
of
replacement
lenses
sold
in
model
years
199192
,
[
mercedes
]
estimates
that
approximately
500
lenses
are
replaced
each
year
in
the
subject
vehicles
.
thus
,
the
number
of
vehicles
involved
is
relatively
low
.
effective
11/02/1993
,
[
mercedes
]
no
longer
sells
lenses
as
a
replacement
part
.
this
means
that
no
source
for
replacement
lenses
now
exists
.
therefore
,
when
lenses
are
damaged
in
the
future
,
the
owners
only
recourse
will
be
to
replace
the
entire
headlamp
assembly
that
complies
with
standard
108
.
in
the
unlikely
event
that
a
noncomplying
aftermarket
lens
market
were
developed
for
the
46000
vehicles
produced
,
their
use
would
be
restricted
by
state
inspection
laws
.
at
the
present
time
,
approximately
twothirds
two
thirds
of
all
states
have
periodic
inspection
programs
.
as
evidenced
by
*
*
*
*
*
*
state
vehicle
regulations
[
which
mercedes
included
with
its
petition
and
are
contained
in
the
docket
,
replacement
headlamp
lenses
are
required
to
keep
the
headlamp
in
compliance
with
standard
108
.
it
is
our
understanding
that
state
inspection
garages
routinely
reject
cars
if
their
headlamp
lenses
do
not
bear
the
`
dot
'
marking
,
since
the
lack
of
`
dot
'
quickly
identifies
the
headlamp
as
a
nonus
.
unit
.
therefore
,
in
the
unlikely
event
that
a
vehicle
owner
replaces
a
damaged
lens
with
a
noncomplying
aftermarket
lens
rather
than
a
complying
headlamp
assembly
,
the
vehicle
will
fail
inspection
in
most
states
.
