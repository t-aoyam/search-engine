application
programmers
interface
(
api
)
standards
standards
at
the
api
promote
program
and
programmer
portability
.
a
standard
at
this
level
specifies
a
set
of
operations
on
a
variety
of
graphics
objects
.
an
api
standard
provides
for
the
portability
of
applications
across
a
wide
range
of
computer
hardware
,
operating
systems
,
programming
languages
,
and
graphics
devices
.
a
program
written
to
an
api
standard
at
one
facility
in
one
environment
should
be
easily
transferable
to
another
facility
in
a
different
environment
.
facility
dependencies
should
be
the
major
area
requiring
modification
.
the
specific
functions
supported
by
a
particular
api
standard
provide
certain
capabilities
.
the
application
programmer
,
by
identifying
the
capabilities
needed
,
determines
the
api
better
suited
for
the
application
.
as
shown
in
figure
2
,
there
are
currently
two
graphics
api
standards
,
gks
and
phigs
.
gks
provides
a
functional
description
of
a
twodimensional
two
dimensional
(
2d
)
graphics
interface
.
it
provides
the
basic
graphics
support
required
by
a
wide
variety
of
applications
requiring
the
production
of
computergenerated
computer
generated
pictures
.
a
procedural
language
binding
of
a
functional
standard
specifies
the
exact
name
for
each
operation
,
its
parameter
sequence
,
and
the
data
types
for
the
parameters
.
fortran
,
pascal
,
ada
and
c
language
bindings
are
parts
of
gks
.
gks
is
suitable
for
use
in
graphics
programming
applications
that
employ
a
broad
spectrum
of
graphics
,
from
simple
passive
graphics
output
(
where
pictures
are
produced
solely
by
output
functions
without
interaction
with
an
operator
)
to
interactive
applications
;
and
which
control
a
whole
range
of
graphics
devices
,
including
but
not
limited
to
vector
and
raster
devices
,
microfilm
recorders
,
storage
tube
displays
,
refresh
displays
,
and
color
displays
.
phigs
provides
for
the
definition
,
display
,
modification
,
and
manipulation
of
2d
and
3d
graphical
data
.
it
provides
functionality
to
support
storage
of
graphics
and
application
data
in
a
hierarchical
form
.
information
may
be
inserted
,
changed
,
and
deleted
from
the
hierarchical
data
storage
with
the
functions
provided
by
phigs
.
language
binding
specifications
for
phigs
include
fortran
,
c
and
ada
.
phigs
is
specifically
designed
to
meet
the
performance
requirements
of
such
demanding
applications
as
computer
aided
design
computer
aided
engineering
computer
aided
manufacturing
,
command
and
control
,
molecular
modeling
,
simulation
and
process
control
.
capabilities
in
phigs
but
not
in
gks
include
:
the
centralized
hierarchical
data
storage
:
the
dynamic
and
responsive
nature
of
interactions
;
the
addition
of
a
modeling
capability
;
and
support
for
color
models
other
than
redgreenblue
red
green
blue
(
rgb
.
interoperability
standards
graphics
interoperability
standards
allow
graphical
data
to
be
interchanged
between
graphics
devices
.
as
shown
in
figure
2
,
there
are
three
graphics
interoperability
standards
,
cgm
,
(
future
)
cgi
,
and
iges
.
cgm
is
used
for
the
storage
and
transfer
of
picture
description
information
.
it
enables
pictures
to
be
recorded
for
long
term
storage
,
and
to
be
exchanged
between
graphics
devices
,
system
,
and
installations
.
as
indicated
in
figure
2
,
the
storage
mechanism
for
cgm
is
in
the
form
of
a
neutral
file
formal
called
a
metafile
.
the
software
which
creates
the
metafile
is
known
as
a
cgm
generator
.
the
software
which
reads
and
displays
a
cgm
metafile
is
known
as
an
interpreter
.
cgm
specifies
a
semantic
interface
that
describes
2d
graphical
entities
using
primitives
(
like
polyline
,
text
,
and
ellipse
)
and
attributes
(
like
color
,
line
width
,
interior
style
,
and
fonts
.
cgm
is
compatible
with
the
specification
of
2d
elements
in
gks
.
a
data
encoding
specifies
the
exact
sequence
of
bits
used
to
represent
each
operation
and
its
parameters
.
cgm
contains
three
types
of
data
stream
encodings
(
binary
,
character
,
and
clear
text
)
to
provide
the
implementor
choices
depending
on
the
particular
application
.
iges
provides
a
method
for
representing
and
storing
geometric
,
topological
,
and
nongeometric
product
definition
data
that
is
independent
of
any
one
system
.
where
cgm
transfers
graphical
pictures
,
iges
transfers
a
graphical
database
which
can
be
processed
to
represent
a
picture
.
thus
iges
represents
more
than
just
purely
graphical
data
.
as
figure
2
indicates
,
the
storage
mechanism
for
iges
is
in
the
form
of
a
neutral
file
format
that
must
be
translated
by
a
preprocessor
and
postprocessor
for
conversion
between
systems
.
iges
permits
the
compatible
exchange
of
product
definition
data
used
by
various
computer
aided
design
computer
aided
manufacturing
(
cad
cam
)
systems
.
the
future
cgi
standard
is
designed
to
specify
the
exchange
of
information
at
the
virtual
device
interface
.
it
will
provide
an
interface
between
the
device
independent
and
device
dependent
parts
of
a
graphics
system
.
since
cgi
contains
information
at
a
virtual
level
,
it
can
be
used
to
create
a
cgm
.
a
cgm
can
also
be
output
on
a
cgi
device
in
a
straightforward
manner
.
