although
the
rapid
growth
rule
was
not
mandated
by
any
statute
,
the
history
of
the
present
brokered
deposit
regulation
involves
two
statutes
,
firrea
and
fdicia
.
in
1989
,
firrea
amended
the
federal
deposit
insurance
act
(
fdi
act
,
prohibiting
an
undercapitalized
institution
from
accepting
funds
obtained
,
directly
or
indirectly
,
by
or
through
any
deposit
broker
for
deposit
into
one
or
more
deposit
accounts
except
upon
specific
application
to
,
and
waiver
of
the
prohibition
by

the
fdic

section
224
of
firrea
,
adding
section
29
to
the
fdi
act

12

1831f
.
in
addition
to
deposits
obtained
through
the
mediation
of
thirdparty
third
party
brokers
,
the
definition
of
`
brokered
deposits
'
included
deposits
on
which
an
institution
offers
or
has
agreed
to
pay
rates
of
interest
that
are
`
significantly
'
higher
than
the
prevailing
rates
of
interest
offered
by
other
depository
institutions
with
the
same
type
of
charter
in
the
first
institutions
normal
market
area
.
two
years
later
,
the
fdi
act
was
amended
again
.
this
time
,
fdicia
rewrote
section
29
of
the
act
to
restrict
the
acceptance
of
brokered
deposits
by
certain
institutions
on
the
basis
of
their
capital
levels
.
section
301
of
fdicia
,
amending
section
29
of
the
fdi
act
and
adding
section
29a
thereto
,
12
usc
.
1831f
,
1831f1
.
according
to
fdicia
and
the
brokered
deposit
regulation
implementing
it
,
12
cfr
3376
,
undercapitalized
institutions
may
not
accept
brokered
deposits
at
all
,
and
adequately
capitalized
institutions
must
obtain
a
waiver
from
the
fdic
before
they
can
accept
brokered
deposits
.
further
,
fdicia
limits
the
interest
rates
which
adequately
capitalized
institutions
can
pay
on
brokered
deposits
.
wellcapitalized
well
capitalized
insured
depository
institutions
,
however
,
can
accept
,
renew
or
roll
over
brokered
deposits
without
first
obtaining
a
waiver
from
the
fdic
,
and
without
being
limited
in
the
interest
rates
they
can
pay
.
in
addition
to
these
restrictions
on
brokered
deposits
,
fdicia
also
established
a
comprehensive
regulatory
scheme
for
insured
depository
institutions
based
on
their
capital
levels
.
section
131
of
fdicia
,
adding
section
38
to
the
fdi
act
,
12
usc
.
1831o
.
under
the
`
prompt
corrective
action
'
provisions
of
fdicia
,
the
statute
places
severe
constraints
on
what
undercapitalized
institutions
can
do
,
including
severe
restrictions
on
asset
growth
.
as
explained
in
the
regulation
which
implements
section
131
of
fdicia
,
12
cfr
308
200
ff
.
and
325
101
ff
,
and
which
took
effect
on
12/19/1992
,
as
soon
as
a
bank
receives
notice
,
or
is
deemed
to
have
received
notice
,
that
it
is
undercapitalized
,
significantly
undercapitalized
,
or
critically
undercapitalized
,
the
bank
must
restrict
the
growth
of
its
assets
as
set
forth
in
section
38e3
)
of
the
fdi
act
.
that
section
of
the
act
states
that
an
undercapitalized
insured
depository
institution
shall
not
permit
its
average
total
assets
during
any
calendar
quarter
to
exceed
its
average
total
assets
during
the
preceding
calendar
quarter
unless
:
(
1
)
the
appropriate
federal
banking
agency
has
accepted
the
institutions
capital
restoration
plan
;
(
2
)
any
increase
in
total
assets
is
consistent
with
the
plan
;
and
(
3
)
the
institutions
ratio
of
tangible
equity
to
assets
increases
during
the
calendar
quarter
at
a
rate
sufficient
to
enable
the
institution
to
become
adequately
capitalized
within
a
reasonable
time
.
12
usc
.
1831oe3
.
in
view
of
the
above
statutes
and
regulations
,
the
fdic
is
considering
whether
there
is
a
continuing
need
for
the
rapid
growth
rule
.
under
the
rule
,
the
fdic
,
upon
being
informed
by
a
bank
that
it
is
about
to
undergo
rapid
growth
,
can
engage
the
institution
in
a
dialog
as
to
whether
such
growth
would
be
prudent
and
should
be
pursued
.
under
the
brokered
deposit
and
prompt
corrective
action
regulations
,
restrictions
on
brokered
deposits
and
rapid
growth
attach
automatically
to
certain
banks
having
an
insufficient
capital
level
.
thus
,
although
the
rapid
growth
rule
operates
somewhat
differently
from
the
brokered
deposit
and
prompt
corrective
action
regulations
,
the
rapid
growth
rule
may
no
longer
be
necessary
given
the
existence
of
those
other
two
regulations
.
for
this
reason
,
the
fdic
is
proposing
that
the
rapid
growth
rule
be
rescinded
.
this
action
will
ease
the
regulatory
burden
on
those
institutions
now
subject
to
all
three
rules
.
(
if
the
fdic
rescinds
the
rapid
growth
rule
,
12
cfr
3046
,
it
will
also
rescind
the
line
on
the
table
in
12
cfr
3047
,
which
pertains
to
the
office
of
management
and
budgets
control
number
for
the
rapid
growth
rule
)
request
for
public
comment
while
the
rapid
growth
rule
overlaps
the
brokered
deposit
regulation
and
the
prompt
corrective
action
regulation
,
this
overlap
is
only
partial
.
for
instance
,
rescinding
the
rapid
growth
rule
would
mean
that
an
insured
bank
would
no
longer
have
to
notify
the
fdic
before
it
either
solicited
fully
insured
deposits
outside
its
normal
trade
area
,
or
when
it
acquired
secured
borrowings
,
including
repurchase
agreements
,
if
one
or
a
combination
of
both
of
these
activities
were
designed
to
increase
the
banks
assets
by
more
than
75
percent
during
any
consecutive
threemonth
three
month
period
.
and
while
a
wellcapitalized
well
capitalized
bank
planning
to
accept
brokered
deposits
on
a
large
scale
would
no
longer
have
to
inform
the
fdic
of
this
fact
in
advance
once
the
rapid
growth
rule
was
rescinded
,
that
bank
still
must
report
the
amount
of
brokered
money
it
has
accepted
after
the
fact
in
its
quarterly
report
of
condition
and
income
(
call
report
.
also
,
deposit
brokers
must
continue
to
register
with
the
fdic
,
and
,
if
requested
,
could
be
required
to
provide
data
on
the
extent
of
a
given
banks
brokered
deposit
activities
,
under
the
brokered
deposit
regulation
.
if
the
rapid
growth
rule
were
rescinded
,
some
of
the
rapid
growth
resulting
from
rapid
growth
rule
activities
would
continue
to
be
detected
by
the
fdics
growth
monitoring
system
(
a
system
administered
by
the
fdics
division
of
supervision
which
identifies
rapid
growth
over
a
single
quarter
in
assets
or
loans
and
longterm
long
term
securities
and
any
related
deterioration
in
key
performance
ratios
,
some
rapid
growth
would
be
controlled
or
prohibited
by
the
brokered
deposit
rule
,
and
some
would
be
prohibited
by
the
regulation
on
prompt
corrective
action
,
but
a
small
part
of
rapid
growth
might
not
be
controlled
or
detected
at
all
.
thus
,
comment
is
sought
on
whether
the
rescission
of
the
rapid
growth
rule
would
create
a
regulatory
gap
that
would
have
harmful
effects
on
banking
.
