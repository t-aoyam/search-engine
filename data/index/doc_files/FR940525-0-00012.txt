materials
incorporated
by
reference
are
available
for
examination
or
purchase
as
stated
above
.
the
large
number
of
siaps
,
their
complex
nature
,
and
the
need
for
a
special
format
make
their
verbatim
publication
in
the
federal
register
expensive
and
impractical
.
further
,
airmen
do
not
use
the
regulatory
text
of
the
siaps
,
but
refer
to
their
graphic
depiction
of
charts
printed
by
publishers
of
aeronautical
materials
.
thus
,
the
advantages
of
incorporation
by
reference
are
realized
and
publication
of
the
complete
description
of
each
siap
contained
in
faa
form
documents
is
unnecessary
.
the

sections

with
the
types
and
effective

for
safety
and
timeliness
of
change
considerations
,
this
amendment
incorporates
only
specific
changes
contained
in
the
content
of
the
following
fdc
p
notam
for
each
siap
.
the
siap
information
in
some
previously
designated
fdc
temporary
(
fdc

)
notams
is
of
such
duration
as
to
be
permanent
.
with
conversion
to
fdc
p
notams
,
the
respective
fdc
t
notams
have
been
cancelled
.
the
fdc
p
notams
for
the
siaps
contained
in
this
amendment
are
based
on
the
criteria
contained
in
the
us
.
standard
for
terminal
instrument
approach
procedures
(
terps
.
in
developing
these
chart
changes
to
siaps
by
fdc
p
notams
,
the
terps
criteria
were
applied
to
only
these
specific
conditions
existing
at
the
affected
airports
.
this
amendment
to
part
97
contains
separate
siaps
which
have
compliance
dates
stated
as
effective
dates
based
on
related
changes
in
the
national
airspace
system
or
the
application
of
new
or
revised
criteria
.
all
siap
amendments
in
this
rule
have
been
previously
issued
by
the
faa
in
a
national
flight
data
center
(
fdc
)
notice
to
airmen
(
notam
)
as
an
emergency
action
of
immediate
flight
safety
relating
directly
to
published
aeronautical
charts
.
the
circumstances
which
created
the
need
for
all
these
siap
amendments
requires
making
them
effective
in
less
than
30
days
.
further
,
the
siaps
contained
in
this
amendment
are
based
on
the
criteria
contained
in
the
terps
.
because
of
the
close
and
immediate
relationship
between
these
siaps
and
safety
in
air
commerce
,
i
find
that
notice
and
public
procedure
before
adopting
these
siaps
are
unnecessary
,
impracticable
,
and
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
,
where
applicable
,
that
good
cause
exists
for
making
these
siaps
effective
in
less
than
30
days
.
