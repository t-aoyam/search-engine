several
comments
urged
the
agency
not
to
adopt
a
testing
method
that
utilizes
photosensitizing
chemicals
.
the
comments
presented
a
number
of
arguments
against
this
type
of
testing
.
it
is
considered
unethical
because
of
the
carcinogenic
potential
of
the
photosensitizing
chemical
(
such
as
8mop
mop
.
the
action
spectrum
(
ie
,
for
8mop
mop
induced
erythema
)
is
artificial
and
inappropriate
.
the
values
obtained
vary
with
the
sensitizing
chemical
used
and
the
spectrum
of
the
irradiating
source
used
.
the
values
obtained
have
no
relevance
to
reallife
real
life
situations
.
the
testing
may
result
in
a
persistence
of
pigmentation
or
blistering
reactions
.
8mop
mop
sensitization
exaggerates
the
biological
response
and
presents
a
risk
of
causing
severe
ulcerative
acute
reactions
.
8mop
mop
puts
subjects
at
risk
for
phototoxic
reactions
for
up
to
6
hours
after
exposure
.
one
comment
contended
that
photosensitizing
testing
methods
have
a
number
of
benefits
,
such
as
short
irradiance
times
,
clearly
defined
endpoints
,
and
reproducible
results
.
the
comment
added
that
the
results
from
these
test
methods
are
relevant
to
patients
taking
8mop
mop
or
other
photosensitizing
drugs
with
similar
action
spectra
.
the
comment
concluded
that
photosensitizing
test
methods
could
be
useful
to
determine
photoprotection
factors
for
claims
against
phototoxic
reactions
.
several
comments
urged
the
agency
to
accept
the
ipd
testing
method
for
determining
uva
protection
.
one
comment
stated
that
the
ipd
method
is
generally
recognized
by
a
substantial
body
of
scientists
as
the
preferred
uva
testing
method
.
several
comments
provided
a
number
of
benefits
for
using
the
ipd
method
.
they
claimed
that
this
test
method
is
the
one
that
is
most
representative
of
true
conditions
because
it
is
an
in
vivo
determination
that
accounts
for
biological
reactions
that
can
occur
on
living
skin
.
unlike
the
testing
procedure
using
skin
photosensitized
with
8mop
mop
,
the
ipd
test
is
indicative
of
a
true
broad
spectrum
response
of
normal
healthy
skin
.
unlike
erythema
that
is
a
response
only
to
the
shorter
wavelength
uva
radiation
,
ipd
is
a
response
to
broad
spectrum
uva
radiation
.
the
ipd
method
requires
the
use
of
considerably
lower
doses
of
radiation
energy
,
thus
exposing
subjects
to
less
risk
.
the
ipd
method
uniquely
compliments
the
current
spf
system
by
accurately
reflecting
the
actual
amount
of
long
wave
uva
radiation
attenuated
by
a
sunscreen
product
.
the
ipd
method
is
reliable
,
accurate
,
and
reproducible
.
the
ipd
test
can
be
performed
in
a
standard
sunscreen
evaluation
laboratory
with
minimal
adaptation
of
existing
equipment
.
the
comments
concluded
that
until
wellestablished
well
established
action
spectra
for
specific
uva
damage
are
established
,
ipd
is
the
best
method
currently
available
because
it
reflects
broad
spectrum
uva
protection
equally
across
the
entire
uva
spectrum
.
one
comment
submitted
a
testing
protocol
using
ipd
as
the
endpoint
(
ref
.
21
.
the
comment
stated
that
the
suggested
testing
procedure
fulfilled
a
number
of
criteria
.
the
resulting
protection
factor
gives
the
consumer
additional
information
about
the
sunscreen
number
,
complementing
the
spf
value
.
the
response
variable
has
a
relatively
flat
action
spectrum
(
ie
,
320
to
400
nm
,
with
a
low
peak
at
around
340
nm
)
throughout
the
region
of
interest
.
using
this
spectrum
results
in
uva
protection
values
that
closely
reflect
the
actual
amount
of
radiation
reduced
.
the
testing
response
obeys
dose
reciprocity
over
the
anticipated
irradiance
range
.
the
test
is
practical
with
minimal
risk
to
subjects
.
the
comment
added
that
an
eightcenter
eight
center
clinical
test
has
validated
this
method
as
acceptable
for
determining
uva
protection
over
the
entire
uva
spectrum
,
including
long
wavelength
uva
(
ie
,
340
to
400
nm
.
the
comment
submitted
clinical
test
results
from
the
eight
test
sites
(

21
.
each
testing
facility
completed
between
10
and
20
subjects
.
subjects
with
skin
types
iii
and

used

four
sunscreen

and
a

were

the
protocol
used
a
randomized
,
complete
block
design
with
all
subjects
at
each
testing
center
receiving
all
five
test
materials
.
the
comment
stated
that
the
studies
were
conducted
similar
to
an
spf
test
,
but
a
detailed
protocol
was
not
submitted
.
for
example
,
uva
dosages
and
application
density
of
the
test
sunscreens
were
not
noted
.
six
sites
used
a
150watt

one

used
a
1000w
xenon
lamp
with
3mm

and
2mm
ug11
filters
.
one
site
used
a
krypton
lamp
(
ie
,
dermlite
)
of
unspecified
wattage
.
the
comment
noted
that
neither
of
the
last
two
uva
sources
are
recommended
,
and
the
results
obtained
using
these
lamps
were
included
for
information
purposes
only
.
the
ipd
threshold
dose
of
uva
radiation
was
first
measured
on
unprotected
skin
,
then
on
protected
skin
.
the
ratio
of
these
two
doses
was
then
calculated
to
derive
the
uva
protection
factor
(

.
the
ipd
was
graded
immediately
after
uv
exposure

allowing
