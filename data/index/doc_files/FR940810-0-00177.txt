industry
.
osha
estimated
economic
impacts
in
construction
using
three
economic
impact
measures
,
calculated
for
each
affected
industry
group
.
the
first
measure
is
the
ratio
of
the
average
annual
compliance
cost
per
affected
establishment
(
or
per
exposed
construction
worker
)
to
an
estimate
of
the
average
payroll
per
establishment
(
or
per
construction
worker
.
as
explained
above
,
this
measure
compares
the
projected
compliance
costs
to
labor
costs
normally
incurred
by
the
establishment
.
the
second
impact
measure
is
the
ratio
of
the
average
annual
compliance
cost
per
affected
establishment
(
or
per
exposed
construction
worker
)
to
an
estimate
of
the
net
dollar
value
of
construction
work
or
sales
for
an
average
establishment
(
or
per
construction
worker
.
this
ratio
indicates
the
relationship
of
the
compliance
costs
to
an
establishment
or
workers
output
and
indicates
the
maximum
impact
on
prices
assuming
100
percent
passthrough
pass
through
of
the
compliance
costs
to
the
consumer
.
the
third
economic
impact
statistic
calculated
by
osha
for
construction
measures
the
effect
of
compliance
costs
on
profits
.
profit
impacts
were
calculated
at
the
industry
level
by
dividing
into
compliance
costs
per
establishment
,
the
estimated
pretax
tax
profit
per
establishment
.
this
index
reveals
the
maximum
potential
impact
on
profits
under
the
assumption
that
compliance
costs
are
fully
absorbed
by
the
affected
firm
.
profit
impacts
are
particularly
meaningful
when
establishments
face
highlycompetitive
highly
competitive
conditions
which
prevent
the
passthrough
pass
through
of
compliance
costs
to
customers
.
annual
incremental
compliance
costs

firm
were
estimated
using
the
costs
