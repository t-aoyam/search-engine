selection
of
emission
points
the
specific
emission
points
regulated
by
the
proposed
standards
are
finishing
,
gluing
,
cleaning
,
and
washoff
operations
,
all
of
which
are
described
in
section
ii
.
at
some
wood
furniture
facilities
,
only
finishing
and
cleaning
operations
will
occur
.
at
others
,
all
four
operations
will
take
place
.
finishing
operations
may
be
a
small
part
of
some
plant
operations
(
eg
,
upholstered
furniture
,
or
may
comprise
the
majority
of
plant
operations
(
eg
,
residential
furniture
.
nonetheless
,
finishing
,
gluing
,
cleaning
,
and
washoff
operations
are
the
primary
hap
emission
sources
at
wood
furniture
facilities
.
the
proposed
standards
for
finishing
and
cleaning
operations
were
developed
within
the
framework
of
the
regulatory
negotiation
described
in
section
ib
.
the
proposed
standards
for
gluing
operations
were
developed
by
the
agency
because
adhesive
suppliers
were
not
represented
on
the
committee
.
however
,
the
agency
did
consult
with
adhesive
suppliers
and
operators
that
perform
gluing
operations
in
developing
the
proposed
standards
.
the
epa
survey
of
the
industry
also
included
questions
concerning
gluing
operations
.
the
epa
analysis
indicates
that
there
are
four
primary
types
of
adhesives
used
by
the
wood
furniture
industry
:
hot
melts
,
polyvinyl
acetate
(
pva
)
adhesives
,
ureaformaldehyde
urea
formaldehyde
(
uf
)
resins
,
and
contact
adhesives
.
the
proposed
standards
do
not
regulate
uf
resins
,
hot
melts
,
or
pva
adhesives
.
the
epa
has
explored
the
issue
of
uf
resins
in
developing
the
neshap
and
has
decided
not
to
control
formaldehyde
emissions
from
uf
resins
in
the
proposed
standards
.
ureaformaldehyde
urea
formaldehyde
resins
were
removed
from
consideration
during
the
regulatory
negotiation
because
the
committee
members
did
not
represent
parties
that
would
be
significantly
affected
by
these
provisions
.
the
epa
investigated
uf
resins
outside
of
the
negotiation
using
survey
data
,
studies
,
and
in
meetings
with
the
manufacturers
and
users
.
the
major
use
of
uf
resins
in
the
furniture
industry
is
the
manufacture
of
plywood
.
a
furniture
facility
may
make
plywood
for
later
use
or
glue
decorative
wood
veneers
to
a
wood
substrate
as
part
of
the
manufacturing
process
.
both
of
these
processes
,
however
,
are
considered
to
be
plywood
manufacturing
.
thus
,
it
makes
sense
to
control
formaldehyde
emissions
from
uf
resins
in
a
broader
,
more
comprehensive
format
through
the
neshap
for
plywood
and
particleboard
manufacturing
that
is
scheduled
to
be
promulgated
in
2000
.
accordingly
,
the
epa
has
decided
to
defer
controlling
emissions
from
uf
resins
in
the
proposed
standards
.
in
the
interim
,
some
members
of
the
uf
resins
industry
have
expressed
a
willingness
to
work
together
with
the
epa
to
explore
scientific
approaches
to
measure
emissions
and
evaluate
control
technologies
that
limit
emissions
from
uf
resins
and
wood
products
containing
these
resins
.
hot
melts
are
also
not
covered
by
the
proposed
standards
because
they
are
not
sources
of
hap
emissions
.
hot
melts
are
solid
,
ethylene
vinyl
acetatebased
acetate
based
products
that
are
used
primarily
for
edgebanding
,
which
is
the
process
of
applying
a
laminate
to
the
edge
of
a
countertop
,
desktop
,
table
,
or
other
piece
of
furniture
.
the
pva
adhesives
are
waterbased
emulsions
that
have
the
potential
to
emit
small
amounts
of
vinyl
acetate
monomer
,
a
hap
.
typically
,
pva
adhesives
contain
less
than
03
percent
vinyl
acetate
monomer
and
are
among
the
lowest
emitting
adhesives
used
by
the
industry
.
the
epa
is
not
aware
of
lower
emitting
alternatives
that
can
be
used
for
all
applications
for
which
pva
adhesives
are
used
.
for
this
reason
,
the
epa
is
proposing
that
the
use
of
pva
adhesives
not
be
regulated
by
the
proposed
standards
.
c
.
selection
of
proposed
emission
limits
the
proposed
emission
limits
include
a
hap
emission
limit
for
finishing
operations
,
a
limit
on
the
hap
content
of
contact
adhesives
,
and
a
limit
on
the
voc
content
of
strippable
spray
booth
materials
.
for
a
description
of
the
rationale
for
selecting
the
proposed
format
for
these
emission
limits
,

to
set

emissions
that
represent
the
maximum

for

a
