the
nasd
does
not
believe
that
it
is
appropriate
for
any
nasd
member
to
purchase
a
`
hot
issue
'
for
its
own
account
and
that
the
categories
of
exemption
should
not
be
expanded
to
include
member
firms
or
expanding
the
categories
to
be
exempted
.
the
nasd
,
however
,
agrees
with
the
suggestion
of
several
commentators
that
this
exemption
be
expanded
to
cover
all
persons
associated
with
direct
participation
program
or
investment
company
variable
product
broker
dealers
regardless
of
their
registration
status
.
the
association
has
considered
that
the
nasds
membership
committee
encourages
members
to
qualify
their
registered
persons
through
series
7
even
if
they
are
going
to
do
limited
activities
and
that
these
individuals
should
not
be
penalized
for
holding
such
licenses
.
investment
partnerships
and
corporations
there
were
several
comments
on
the
proposed
changes
,
and
opposition
to
applying
the
interpretation
to
investment
partnerships
and
corporations
in
general
.
first
,
all
those
who
commented
on
substituting
a
certified
public
accounts
certification
in
lieu
of
an
attorney
opinion
letter
,
including
the
american
institute
of
certified
public
accountants
(
aicpa
,
maintained
that
the
certification
would
not
work
because
the
certification
is
more
legal
than
factual
,
and
because
the
analysis
for
certification
would
not
comply
with
the
`
attestation
standards
'
necessary
for
a
cpa
to
render
such
a
certification
.
notwithstanding
the
proposed
amendments
,
several
of
the
commenters
had
general
policy
concerns
with
investment
partnerships
and
corporations
.
most
believed
that
the
interpretation
should
not
apply
to
partnerships
because
:
(
1
)
partnerships
typically
represent
interests
of
individual
investors
,
thus
the
objectives
of
a
bona
fide
distribution
are
furthered
by
distribution
to
partnerships
;
and
(
2
)
the
interpretation
unfairly
discriminates
between
mutual
fund
type
accounts
and
partnerships
because
of
size
,
maintaining
that
there
is
no
need
for
delineation
because
most
limited
partners
have
no
control
over
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities
for
the
account
and
do
not
exercise
any
discretion
.
one
commenter
maintained
that
precedent
for
such
a
position
could
be
found
in
rules
and
interpretations
under
§
16
of
the
exchange
act
,
which
does
not
require
officers
to
disgorge
profits
resulting
from
transactions
through
investment
partnerships
.
further
,
most
maintained
that
receipt
of
performancebased
performance
based
fees
alone
should
not
restrict
an
account
,
maintaining
that
partnership
law
typically
requires
that
a
general
partner
manager
maintain
some
de
minimis
equity
position
in
the
partnership
.
in
addition
,
one
commenter
believed
that
the
responsibility
for
opening
up
a
separate
hot
issue
account
should
rest
with
the
member
.
several
of
the
commenters
suggested
various
de
minimis
provisions
which
would
allow
the
participation
by
investment
partnerships
in
hot
issues
,
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
a
restricted
persons
.
the
nasd
has
considered
the
comment
of
the
aicpa
that
accountants
cannot
provide
the
certification
proposed
in
the
notice
and
therefore
has
proposed
that
a
written
representation
of
an
accountant
or
counsel
be
substituted
for
the
accountants
certification
.
this
written
representation
would
replace
the
existing
`
opinion
of
counsel
'
under
paragraph
b
of
the
investment
partnerships
and
corporations
section
of
the
interpretation
.
the
nasd
believes
that
the
proposed
`
written
representation
'
satisfies
the
associations
objective
of
ensuring
that
members
seek
the
counsel
of
an
independent
,
qualified
third
party
in
meeting
their
obligations
under
the
interpretation
,
while
not
imposing
any
requirements
that
are
unduly
burdensome
or
unnecessarily
problematic
.
the
nasd
has
also
considered
various
comments
that
indicate
that
more
trustees
and
institutional
investors
are
demanding
that
performancebased
performance
based
fees
be
charged
rather
than
asset
based
fees
for
money
management
services
and
therefore
has
proposed
that
performancebased
performance
based
fees
be
deleted
from
the
definition
of
beneficial
interest
under
the
interpretation
.
in
response
to
other
comments
,
the
nasd
believes
that
securities
placed
into
a
carved
out
`
hot
issue
'
account
should
remain
in
that
account
until
sold
.
the
association
does
not
believe
that
such
securities
should
be
subject
to
`
journaling
'
to
the
regular
account
after
a
specified
time
period
in
that
such
a
procedure
would
be
difficult
to
monitor
.
foreign
mutual
funds
the
board
of
governors
solicited
comment
as
to
exempting
foreign
mutual
funds
from
the
investment
partnerships
and
corporations
section
of
the
interpretation
,
similar
to
the
exemption
provided
for
sales
to
investment
companies
registered
under
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
.
one
commenter
suggested
that
the
exemption
apply
only
to
foreign
investment
companies
which
are
subject
to
regulation
under
foreign
laws
expressly
designed
for
investment
companies
and
or
satisfy
minimum
standards
that
the
nasd
would
establish
.
another
commenter
expressed
disappointment
that
the
notice
did
not
address
the
application
of
the
interpretation
to
foreign
broker
dealers
in
general
.
the
nasd
is
concerned
as
to
whether
the
association
can
adequately
determine
whether
a
foreign
countrys
mutual
fund
regulation
is
similar
to
our
own
.
the
nasd
has
concluded
,
therefore
,
that
no
provisions
should
be
adopted
at
this
time
.
if
,
however
,
the
nasd
can
develop
a
substantial
equivalence
standard
,
the
issue
could
be
revisited
.
venture
capital
investors
those
who
commenter
generally
supported
the
exemption
,
and
proposed
certain
revisions
.
one
commenter
maintained
that
allowing
the
venture
capital
investor
to
purchase
only
up
to
his
percentage
ownership
for
the
prior
year
was
too
limiting
in
that
a
venture
capitalist
could
make
a
crucial
contribution
after
the
one
year
mark
,
well
before
the
issuer
goes
public
,
and
should
be
able
to
recover
that
contribution
in
stock
.
another
commenter
believed
that
the
requirement
that
no
special
terms
be
received
by
the
purchasers
should
be
qualified
to
limit
that
to
`
special
terms
from
the
member
'
because
a
venture
capitalist
typically
enters
into
special
arrangements
with
the
issuer
which
could
be
construed
as
prohibited
special
terms
.
the
nasd
believes
it
is
an
appropriate
requirement
that
a
venture
capital
investor
have
an
ownership
interest
in
the
entity
for
at
least
one
year
prior
to
the
offering
;
however
,
in
response
to
the
comments
,
the
nasd
believes
that
it
is
appropriate
to
use
three
months
before
the
date
that
the
registration
statement
is
filed
as
the
date
to
be
used
for
calculating
the
investors
'
existing
ownership
interest
.
the
nasd
,
in
keeping
with
its
prior
recommendation
,
believes
that
a
three
month
holding
period
for
the
securities
received
in
the
distribution
is
appropriate
.
