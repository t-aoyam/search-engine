asbestos
disturbing
activities
within

'
and
has
concluded
that
some
of
these
activities
can
result
in
significant
risk
from
exposure
of
workers
.
the
range
of
activities
and
exposure
potential
encompassed
by
a
class
iii
designation
is
wide
.
the
studies
generally
show
that
when
protective
work
practices
are
used
by
trained
workers
,
exposures
are
greatly
reduced
.
thus
,
osha
is
requiring
various
work
practices
and
protective
measures
to
reduce
exposure
to
asbestos
containing
material
(
or
material
which
is
presumed
to
contain
asbestos
)
and
that
workers
must
receive
training
in
courses
which
include
the
appropriate
techniques
to
use
in
handling
and
or
avoiding
such
disturbances
.
osha
concludes
that
these
are
effective
,
feasible
controls

will
