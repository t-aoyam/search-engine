a

of
comments
contended
that

the
statutory

to
prohibit

for

for
which
no
reference
value
(
ie
,
reference

value
(

been
established

the
comments
also
stated
that
the
agency
lacks
legal
authority
to
promulgate
regulations
governing
products
bearing
a
nutrient
content
claim
for
a
nutrient
or
other
substance
not
explicitly
named
in
section
403q1
)
or
(
q2
)
of
the
1990
amendments
.
the
comments
said
that
the
references
to
section
403q1
)
or
(
q2
)
of
the
act
are
references
to
those
nutrients
that
the
1990
amendments
require
to
be
listed
(
mandatory
nutrients
)
on
the
nutrition
label
.
the
comments
argued
that
under
these
provisions
,
a
food
may
be
subject
to
a
misbranding
charge
under
section
403r1
)
of
the
act
only
if
it
characterizes
,
either
explicitly
or
implicitly
,
the
level
of
a
mandatory
nutrient
in
the
food
.
the
comments
also
stated
that
the
1990
amendments
did
not
provide
fda
with
misbranding
authority
over
products
that
bear
a
claim
characterizing
the
level
of
a
nutrient
or
other
substance
that
is
not
listed
in
section
403q1
)
or
(
q2
)
of
the
act
.
the
comments
maintained
that
,
regardless
of
whether
a
rdi
or
drv
has
been
established
,
no
special
requirements
should
apply
if
a
manufacturer
of
a
substance
not
covered
by
section

(

to
claim
that
his
product
was

'
or

`

the
comments
argued
that
while
fda
maintains
its
general
misbranding
authority
over
products
bearing
claims
that
characterize
the
level
of
a
nonmandatory
substance
,
fda
still
must
meet
its
burden
of
proving
that
any
such
claims
are
actually
`
false
or
misleading

any
particular
'

the
general
misbranding
provision

of
the

states
that

as
well
as

thus
,
because
a
statute
must
be
read
as
a
whole
,
the
language
in
section
403r1a
)
and
(

)
of
the
act
that
describes
the
substances
that
may
be
the
subject
of
a
nutrient
content

of
a
health
claim
must
be
read
in
conjunction
with
section
403r5d
,
which
addresses
health
claims
for
vitamins
,
minerals
,
herbs
,
or
other
similar
nutritional
substances

are
components
of

thus
,
the
`
nutrients

the
type
required
by
paragraph
(
q1

or
(
q2
'
that
are
the
subject
of

)
and
(
r1b
)
of
the
act
include
vitamins
,
minerals
,
herbs
,
and
other
similar
nutritional
substances
.
the
legislative
history
of
`
other
nutritional

'
reveals
that
its
coverage
is
broad
and
could
,
in
appropriate
circumstances
,
include

therefore
,
while
a
label
claim
that
a
food
contains
garlic

is
intended
to
describe
the
taste
of
the
food

not
be

of
the

a
claim
that
describes
the
garlic
content
in
a
way
that
reveals
that
garlic
is
being
referred
to
as
a
nutritional
substance
would
be
subject
to
that
section
.
under
section

of
the
act
,
the
latter
claim
would
misbrand
the
food
unless
its
use
has
been
authorized
by
fda
under
section
403r2
.
thus
,
fda
rejects
the
comments
that
disagreed
with
the
proposed
coverage
of
the
nutrient
content
claim
provisions
.
fda
has
relied
on
the
rdis
and
drvs
in
defining
nutrient
content
claims
under
section
403r2
)
of
the
act
because
it
has
concluded
that
if
the
characterization
of
the
level
of
a
nutrient
is
to
have
any
meaning
,
there
must
be
a
level
that
can
be
used
as
a
reference
in
determining
whether
the
characterization
is
valid
and
appropriate
.
the
rdis
and
drvs
provide
such
levels
.
thus
,
in
§

(

fda
has
limited
the
use

many
comments
supported
consistency
in
definitions
for
nutrient
content
claims
between
foods
in

and
dietary

.
however
,
one
comment
stated
that
consistency
in
definitions
for
nutrient
content
claims
for
dietary
supplements
and
foods
in
conventional
food
form
is
inappropriate
.
the
comment
argued
that
fda
has
chosen
to
define
nutrient
content
claims
that
are
not
meaningful
to
the
supplement
industry
and
to
consumers
.
many
comments
pointed
out
that
dietary
supplements
are
intended
to
contribute
,
with
foods
in
conventional
food
form
,
to
consumers
'
daily
nutrient
intake
.
thus
,
the
comments
argued
that
it
is
important
that
the
terms
used
to
describe
the
levels
of
nutrients
in
both
dietary
supplements
and
foods
in
conventional
food
form
be
consistent
.
these
comments
maintained
that
consumers
would
be
confused
if
claims
were
to
be
allowed
on
dietary
supplements
that
were
not
defined
in
the
same
manner
as
those
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
fda
disagrees
with
the
comments
that
said
that
consistency
with
established
nutrient
content
claims
is
inappropriate
as
a
basic
principle
for
defining
nutrient
content
claims
for
dietary
supplements
.
there
is
much
about
dietary
supplements
that
suggests
that
the
principles
that
guide
fda
in
defining
nutrient
content
claims
for
dietary
supplements
should
be
the
same
as
the
principles
that
guide
the
agency
in
defining
nutrient
content
claims
on
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
dietary
supplements
that
are
not
intended
for
use
as
drugs
have
traditionally
been
regulated
as
foods
and
,
as
such
,
must
be
evaluated
within
the
context
of
the
total
daily
diet
.
in
addition
,
nutrients
from
dietary
supplements
serve
the
same
physiological
function
as
nutrients
from
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
while
some
consumers
seek
to
ensure
that
the
nutrient
content
of
their
diet
is
adequate
through
foods
in
conventional
food
form
,
other
consumers
seek
to
ensure
nutritional
adequacy
by
making
dietary
supplements
part
of
their
diets
(
ref
.
1
.
consistent
use
of
terms
on
dietary
supplements
and
on
foods
in
conventional
food
form
will
thus
help
consumers
to
construct
a
nutritionally
adequate
total
daily
diet
by
allowing
consumers
to
make
meaningful
comparisons
among
these
products
.
it
will
also
facilitate
use
of
these
terms
by
consumers
.
over
the
years
,
fda
has
stressed
the
importance
of
consistent
definitions
and
descriptive
terms
as
a
necessary
requirement
for
effective
education
and
for
preventing
misleading
labeling
(
ref
.
2
.
if
terms
were
given
different
definitions
depending
on
whether
they
were
to
be
used
to
describe
foods
in
conventional
food
form
or
dietary
supplements
,
it
would
make
it
much
more
difficult
for
the
public
to
understand
what
these
terms
are
intended
to
convey
about
a
particular
food
.
moreover
,
a
single
definition
for
a
particular
term
eliminates
any
possibility
that
ambiguities
could
be
created
by
the
use
of
that
term
.
therefore
,
the
agency
concludes
that
for
nutrient
content
claims
,
the
definition
of
a
particular
term
should
be
the
same
regardless
of
the
type
of
food
that
it
is
being
used
to
describe
.
additionally
,
fda
has
been
criticized
for
treating
dietary
supplements
differently
than
other
foods
.
fda
has
no
desire
to
discriminate
in
any
way
against
supplements
.
thus
,
by
having
a
single
definition
for
a
particular
nutrient
content
claim
,
fda
is
providing
the
basis
for
dietary
supplements
to
make
the
same
claims
as
other
foods
and
to
be
factored
into
the
diet
like
other
foods
.
nonetheless
,
as
discussed
in
the

(

,
fda
recognizes
that
dietary
supplements
differ
in
at
least
two
respects
from
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
first
,
dietary
supplements
are
likely
to
contain
much
higher
levels
of
nutrients
than
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
thus
,
additional
nutrient
content
claims
that
are
specific
for
dietary
supplements
may
be
appropriate
.
as
discussed
later
in
this
document
,
the
agency
intends
in
the
near
future
to
initiate
a
separate
rulemaking
to
establish
such
claims
for
dietary
supplements
.
second
,
dietary
supplements
generally
do
not
contain
several
nutrients
(
eg
,
fat
,
cholesterol
)
found
in
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
therefore
,
in
this
document
,
fda
is
limiting
the
use
of
certain
claims
that
are
useful
for
describing
foods
in
conventional
food
form
but
that
do
not
meaningfully
describe
dietary
supplements

one
comment
objected
to
the
requirement
to
use
the
word
`
imitation
'
on
dietary
supplements
that
are
nutritionally
inferior
to
other
products
of
the
same
type
.
the
comment
argued
that
fda
was
never
given
the
authority
to
decide
on
formulations
of
dietary
supplements
,
and
that
setting
such
formulations
is
the
exclusive
role
of
the
manufacturer
.
further
,
the
comment
stated
that
there
is
nothing
`
imitation
'
about
`
less
'
in
the
supplement
industry
,
and
that
a
requirement
that
a
supplement
be
labeled
`
imitation
'
if
it
is
nutritionally
inferior
to
another
product
forces
manufacturers
to
increase
potencies
in
order
that
their
products
will
not
have
to
be
labeled
`
imitation
'

section
403r2aii

'
the
nutrient
must
usually
be
present
in
the
food
or
in
a
food
for
which
it
substitutes
,
as
that
term
is
defined
by
the
secretary
(
and
by
delegation
,
fda
)
for
the
food
.
accordingly
,
the
agency
defined
`
substitute
foods
'
in
§
101
13
)
(
21
cfr
1013d
)
in
the
final
rule
on
nutrient
content
claims
(
58
fr
2302
at

)
for
the
purpose
of
identifying
the
characteristics
that
substitute
foods
must
have
if
they
are
to
bear
nutrient
content
claims
that
highlight
differences
between
them
and
the
foods
for
which
they
substitute
.
the
definition
states
that
a
substitute
food
is
one
that
may
be
used
interchangeably
with
another
food
that
it
resembles
,
ie
,
to
which
it
is
organoleptically
,
physically
,
and
functionally
(
including
shelf
life
)
similar
and
to
which
it
is
not
nutritionally
inferior
,
unless
it
is
labeled
as
an
`
imitation
'
additionally
,
§
1013e1
)
(
21
cfr
1013el
)
states
that
a
food
shall
be
deemed
to
be
an
imitation
,
and
thus
subject
to
the
requirements
of
section
403c
)
of
the
act
,
if
it
is
a
substitute
for
or
resembles
another
food
but
is
nutritionally
inferior
to
that
food
.
thus
,
the
issue
that
the
agency
must
consider
is
whether
dietary
supplements
that
are
foods
should
be
subject
to
these
provisions
on
substitute
foods
as
any
other
foods
are
.
the
agency
has
no
evidence
that
manufacturers
will
increase
the
potencies
for
their
products
to
avoid
the
use
of
this
term
and
disagrees
that
this
provision
will
interfere
with
a
manufacturers
right
to
decide
on
product
formulations
.
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
the
term
`
imitation
'
will
ever
be
used
on
dietary
supplements
,
particularly
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
.
the
issue
of
whether
a
supplement
would
be
an
`
imitation
'
would
arise
only
when
a
manufacturer
chooses
to
make
a
`
free
'
or
`
low
'
claim
for
sugar
or
sodium
on
a
dietary
supplement
(
see
comment
4
.
in
such
circumstances
,
under
section
403r2aii
)
of
the
act
,
the
manufacturer
must
identify
a
product
on
the
market
with
which
its
product
can
be
used
interchangeably
,
to
which
the
manufacturers
product
is
not
nutritionally
inferior
,
and
that
contains
sodium
or
sugar
.
such
a
product
may
include
the
version
of
the
manufacturers
product
that
contains
sodium
or
sugar
.
as
long
as
such
a
product
exists
,
the
manufacturers
product
need
not
be
labeled
as
an
imitation
.
moreover
,
if
because
of
the
way
the
manufacturer
has
formulated
its
product
,
there
is
no
product
with
which
it
is
used
interchangeably
,
the
product
can
be
called
`
,
a
sodiumfree
sodium
free
food
'
only
in
the
rare
situations
in
which
neither
of
the
conditions
apply
would
the
product
have
to
be
called
`

'
for
it
to
bear
a
`

or
`
low

claim
.

)
and
(
d2
)
are
designed
to
ensure
that
material
differences
between
the
substitute
food
and
the
reference
food
are
conspicuously
stated
on
the
label
or
labeling
of
the
food
,
so
that
consumers
can
make
fully
informed
judgments
about
the
value
of
the
substitute
food
and
its
usefulness
in
maintaining
healthy
dietary
practices
.
if
a
product
has
substantially
less
of
a
nutrient
than
the
reference
food
,
and
to
that
extent
is
materially
different
and
inferior
in
nutrient
content
,
then
`
imitation
'
is
an
entirely
appropriate
term
.
for
this
reason
,
the
agency
concludes
that
there
is
no
reason
to
apply
the
substitute
food
provisions
any
differently
to
dietary

than
to
other

several
comments
from
dietary
supplement
manufacturers
and
trade
associations
questioned
the
need
to
allow
`
low
'
and
`
free
'
claims
for
nutrients
such
as
fat
and
cholesterol
that
are
not
typically
found
in
dietary
supplements
.
one
comment
suggested
that
`
free
'
`
low
'
and
`
reduced
'
claims
for
calories
,
fat
,
and
cholesterol
on
dietary
supplements
should
be
permitted
only
on
dietary
supplements
that
are
a
significant
source
of
calories
,
such
as
protein
supplements
.
the
comment
argued
that
consumers
do
not
expect
most
dietary
supplements
to
contain
significant
amounts
of
calories
,
and
that
it
is
nonsensical
and
confusing
to
permit
dietary
supplements
that
are
not
a
significant
source
of
calories
to
make
a
claim
about
reduced
amounts
of
calories
,
fat
,
and
cholesterol
contained
therein
.
another
comment
stated
that
americans
who
consume
dietary
supplements
do
not
do
so
because
the
products
are
`
low
in
fat
'
`
cholesterol
free
'
or
`
low
calorie
'
and
that
consumers
are
not
interested
in
the
fat
content
of
dietary
supplements
.
the
comment
argued
that
consumers
care
about
the
substances
in
the
products
and
the
benefits
that
those
products
can
have
for
their
health
.
in
the
proposal
on
nutrient
content
claims
for
dietary
supplements
,
the
agency
requested
comment
on
the
need
for
extending
`
free
'
`
low
'
and
`
reduced
'
claims
to
dietary
supplements
(
58
fr
33731
at
33745
.
the
agency
has
reviewed
the
comments
that
it
received
and
is
persuaded
by
them
that
it
not
meaningful
to
allow
claims
about
the
calorie
,
fat
(
including
saturated
fat
,
or
cholesterol
content
of
most
dietary
supplements
.
most
of
these
products
do
not
contain
those
nutrients
,
and
most
consumers
do
not
expect
that
they
do
.
thus
,
consumers
would
not
generally
look
to
these
products
in
making
dietary
choices
that
are
designed
to
control
the
amount
of
calories
,
fat
,
saturated
fat
,
and
cholesterol
in
the
foods
they
eat
.
in
fact
,
claims
about
these
nutrients
in
most
dietary
supplements
would
only
serve
to
confuse
consumers
.
while
it
is
true
that
fda
is
requiring
information
about
these
nutrients
in
the
nutrition
label
of
supplements
of
herbs
and
of
other
similar
nutritional
substances
,
this
requirement
derives
mainly
from
the
limitation
on
the
exemption
in
section
403q5f
)
of
the
act
(
formerly
section
403q5e
.
see
the
final
rule
on
general
requirements
for
nutrition
labeling
for
dietary
supplements
published
elsewhere
in
this
issue
of
the
federal
register
however
,
the
agency
recognizes
that
there
are
some
dietary
supplements
,
such
as
protein
supplements
,
in
which
the
amount
of
calories
in
the
product
is
significant
to
consumers
.
on
these
products
,
the
source
of
the
calories
,
particularly
whether
they
are
from
fat
,
is
relevant
and
useful
information
.
therefore
,
fda
has
decided
,
based
on
the
comments
that
it
received
to
only
allow
calorie
,
fat
,
saturated
fat
,
and
cholesterol
claims
on
those
dietary
supplements
in
which
the
amount
of
calories
is
important
to
consumers
.
in
attempting
to
define
what
this
level
of
calories
should
be
,
the
agency
looked
first
to
§
1019f1
)
and
(
j4
,
which
said
that
a
food
has
`
insignificant
'
calories
for
the
purposes
of
nutrition
labeling
if
it
has
an
amount
of
calories
that
can
be
rounded
to
zero
.
section
1019c1
)
states
that
`
less
than
5
calories
'
per
serving
may
be
expressed
as
zero
,
the
same
amount
that
is
defined
as
`
calorie
free
'
while
fda
does
not
have
information
on
the
caloric
content
of
dietary
supplements
,
it
would
not
be
unreasonable
to
expect
that
many
dietary
supplements
contain
more
than
5
calories
(
cal
)
per
serving
,
particularly
childrens
chewable
vitamin
and
mineral
supplements
,
supplements
that
contain
herbal
extracts
,
and
supplements
that
contain
caloric
binders
and
fillers
.
thus
,
to
tie
the
use
of
`
free
'
`
low
'
and
`
reduced
'
calorie
,
fat
,
and
cholesterol
claims
on
labels
of
dietary
supplements
to
the
presence
of
more
than
an
`
insignificant
amount
'
of
calories
in
the
food
would
be
overinclusive
inclusive
and
would
allow
many
products
in
which
the
amount
of
calories
is
not
significant
to
consumers
to
bear
such
claims
.
fda
next
looked
at
the
definition
of
`
low
calorie
'
in
§
101
60
)
(
21
cfr
101
60
)
for
use
in
determining
which
dietary
supplements
should
be
allowed
to
bear
`
free
'
`
low
'
and
`
reduced
'
claims
.
section
101
60
)
defines
a
`
low
calorie
'
food
as
a
food
that
contains
40
cal
or
less
per
reference
amount
customarily
consumed
(
hereinafter
referred
to
as
reference
amount
)
and
per
50
grams
(
g
)
if
the
reference
amount
is
small
.
fda
believes
that
40
cal
per
reference
amount
represents
a
reasonable
level
for
demarcating
a
dietetically
relevant
source
of
calories
for
dietary
supplements
.
in
a
product
that
contains
this
amount
of
calories
,
the
source
of
the
calories
(
eg
,
fat
)
is
of
significance
to
consumers
.
accordingly
,
the
agency
is
revising
§
101
62
)
(
21
cfr
101
62
)
by
adding
paragraph
(
a4
)
to
state
that
`
free
'
`
low
'
and
`
reduced
'
claims
for
fat
,
saturated
fat
,
and
cholesterol
may
not
be
made
for
dietary
supplements
that
meet
the
criteria
in
§
101
60
)
and
(
b2
)
for
`
calorie
free
'
and
`
low
calorie
'
claims
.
fda
is
also
revising
§
101
13
)
by
adding
new
paragraph
(
b5
)
to
reflect
these
provisions
.
as
a
consequence
,
claims
that
identify
all
products
of
that
class
of
being
`
low
'
or
`
free
'
of
a
nutrient
(
eg
,
`
vitamin
c
supplement
,
a
fatfree
fat
free
supplement
)
will
also
be
prohibited
.
however
,
to
use
the
same
criteria
(
ie
,
that
a
product
may
not
be
`
calorie
free
'
or
`
low
calorie
)
as
a
basis
for
when
a
calorie
claim
may
be
made
,
has
the
effect
of
prohibiting
the
very
claims
that
the
criterion
seeks
to
permit
,
namely
`
calorie
free
'
and
`
low
calorie
'
claims
.
such
a
criterion
would
permit
only
relative
calorie
claims
(
eg
.
`
reduced
)
on
dietary
supplements
.
therefore
,
a
slightly
different
scheme
for
permitting
calorie
claims
on
certain
dietary
supplements
,
such
as
protein
supplements
,
must
be
derived
.
while
,
as
stated
above
,
the
agency
believes
that
calorie
claims
should
not
be
permitted
on
most
dietary
supplements
,
it
does
believe
that
`
calorie
free
'
and
`
low
calorie
'
claims
may
be
appropriate
if
an
equivalent
amount
of
a
similar
food
(
ie
,
another
protein
supplement
)
that
the
labeled
food
resembles
and
for
which
it
substitutes
would
normally
contain
an
appreciable
amount
of
calories
.
such
a
claim
would
highlight
that
the
labeled
food
had
a
different
calorie
profile
than
would
be
expected
in
the
similar
product
.
it
would
also
serve
to
direct
a
consumer
to
a
product
that
had
a
lower
amount
of
calories
.
because
the
food
would
meet
the
criteria
for
`
low
calorie
'
and
would
be
so
labeled
,
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
highlight
any
comparative
differences
between
the
labeled
and
the
similar
food
as
would
be
required
for
a
relative
claim
.
therefore
,
the
agency
is
revising
§
101
62
)
by
adding
new
paragraph
(
a4
)
to
state
that
claims
for
calories
may
not
be
made
on
labels
of
dietary
supplements
that
meet
the
criteria
in
§
101
60
)
or
(
b2
)
for
`
calorie
free
'
and
`
low
calorie
'
except
when
an
equivalent
amount
of
a
similar
dietary
supplement
(
eg
,
another
protein
supplement
)
that
the
labeled
food
resembles
and
for
which
it
substitutes
normally
exceeds
the
definition
for
`
low
calorie
'
in
§
101
60
.
it
is
including
similar
language
in
§
101
13
.
the
comments
specifically
objected
to
claims
for
calories
,
fat
,
and
cholesterol
.
claims
for
sodium
and
sugar
content
were
not
mentioned
.
since
the
sugar
and
sodium
levels
in
dietary
supplements
can
vary
substantially
,
the
agency
finds
that
claims
about
the
sugar
and
sodium
content
of
dietary
supplements
may
be
useful
in
helping
consumers
to
make
purchasing
decisions
that
will
assist
them
in
maintaining
healthy
dietary
practices
.
thus
,
extending
the
definitions
of
`
low
'
`
free
'
and
`
reduced
'
for
sugar
and
sodium
to
dietary
supplements
is
appropriate
irrespective
of
the
calorie
level
of
the
dietary
supplement
.
therefore
,
fda
concludes
that
there
is
no
need
to
place
limitations
on
claims
for
sugar
and
sodium
content
other
than
those
in
§
§
101
60
)
and
101
61
,
respectively
.
as
explained
below
,
fda
is
amending
these
provisions

(

that
there
was
a
need
to
specify
the
minimum
type
size
for
labeling
information
(
eg
,
accompanying
information
)
required
under
the

for
which
a

and

the
effect
of
these
revisions
for
dietary
supplements
is
that
label
information
required
by
the
nutrient
content
claims
regulations
,
but
whose
type
size
is
not
otherwise
specified
,
will
be
required
to
be

no
less
than
onesixteenth
one
sixteenth

unless
otherwise
specified
by
§

fda
believes
that
making
nutrient
content
claims
on
dietary
supplements
subject
to
this
requirement
is
appropriate
because
this
requirement
is
the
logical
outgrowth
of
the
proposal
.
in
the
proposal
on
nutrient
content
claims
for
dietary
supplements
,
fda
raised
the
issue
of
how
to
make
nutrient
content
claims
on
dietary
supplements
.
the
question
of
how
to
ensure
the
legibility
of
the
referral
statement
,
which
is
required
by
section
403r2b
)
of
the
act
,
is
one
that
is
at
least
implicitly
raised
by
this
issue
.
thus
,
the
agencys
decision
to
explicitly
address
the
question
of
the
type
size
of
the
referral
statement
in
this
final
rule
represents
the
logical
outgrowth
of
issues
that
were
raised
in
the
proposal
.
the
agency
pointed
out
in
the
technical
corrections
document
that
if
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
product
is
not
able
to
comply
with
type
size
requirements
,
manufacturers
may
request
an
alternative
means
of
compliance
(
eg
,
permission
to
use
a
reduced
type
size
)
in
accordance
with
§
§
1019g9
.
section
1019g9
)
states
that
when
it
is
not
technologically
feasible
,
or
some
other
circumstance
makes
it
impracticable
,
for
firms
to
comply
with
nutrition
labeling
requirements
,
they
may
write
to
the
office
of
food
labeling
,
food
and
drug
administration
,
and
request
an
alternative
means
of
compliance
.
for
the
reasons
explained
above
,
dietary
supplements
of
herbs
and
other
similar
nutritional
substances
are
appropriately
subject
to
this
provision
even
though
it
was
not
specifically
set
out
in
the
proposal
on
nutrient
content
claims
for
dietary
supplements
.
a
similar
provision
is
included
in
§
101
36
)
of
the
final
regulation
for
nutrition
labeling
for
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
,
in
a
companion
document
in
this
issue
of
the
federal
register
.
.
these
provisions
allow
flexibility
to
ensure
that
there
will
be
either
sufficient
space
to
make
nutrient
content
claims
on
the
labels
of
dietary
supplements
,
or
that
manufacturers
will
have
recourse
to
request
relief

for
which

on

be

the

suggested
that
the

urge
supplement

the

that
there

a
sufficient

for

either
the
declaration
of

for
requiring

to
the
extent
,

that
the
term

rarely
be
a
useful
term
for
vitamin

stated
that
this
term
might
be
useful
for
certain
dietary

that

the
comment

that
there
are
techniques
for

high
in

omega
fatty
acids

the
comment
suggested
that
the
use
of
the
term
`
modified
'
might
serve
to
distinguish
products
containing
the
concentrated
fish
oils
from
other
fish
oil
products
that
would
have
to
be
taken
several
times
a
day
to
provide
the
same
amount
of
fish
oil
and
thus
result
in
the
consumption
of
significantly
more
calories
.
the
comment
argued
that
use
of
the
term
`

on

should
be
authorized

maintain
the
principle
of
consistency

based
on
the
comment
,
the
agency
concludes
that
this

may
have
some
limited
usefulness

and
thus
this

may
be
used
on
such

stated
that
if

there
need

established
so
that
one
product
recommending

of

,
one
tablespoon
(
tbsp
)
per
day
is
not
compared
to
a
product
recommending
five
tbsp
per

.
the
comment
argued
that
the
proposal
allows
very
flexible
reference
amounts
for
supplements
(
ie
,
whatever
the
manufacturer
is
recommending
for
consumption
)
and
suggests
that
reference
amounts
of
reference
foods
(
as
established
in
§
101

be
specified
in
more
concrete
terms
.
the
agency
is
not
persuaded
by
the
comment
that
more
concrete
terms
are
needed
for
reference
amounts
at
this
time

the

section
101
13
,
which
fda
proposed
to

fda

adopting
a
different
approach

than
the
one
that
it
adopted
for
foods

the
agency
acknowledges
that
there
is
a
potential
for
unfair
marketing
and
misleading
claims
if
the
serving
size
is
manipulated
upwards
or
downwards
to
enable

unnecessarily
restrictive

several

suggested
that

long
as
it
has
either
an

other

other
comments
suggested
that
fda
should
expand
the

rdis
when
it
publishes
the
final

rule
following
the
expiration
of

fda
agrees
that
the
current
list
of
rdis
does
not
represent
the
entire
list
of
nutrients
for
which
dietary
recommendations
have
been
established
.
the
agency
had
proposed
to
establish
rdis
for
all
nutrients
for
which
rdas
or
esaddis
were
provided
in
the
1989
edition
of

nas
rdas

however
,
under
the

the

was
constrained
to
retain
the
label
reference
values
established
in
§
1019c8iv
)
until
at
least
11/08/1993
.
these
values
were
based
on
the
1968
rdas
.
the
1968
rdas
did
not
contain
recommended
dietary
values
for
a
number
of
nutrients
for
which
nas
has
subsequently
provided
rdas
or
esaddis
.
rdas
for
vitamin
k
and
selenium
were
established
subsequent
to
1968
and
are
listed
in
the
1989
edition
of
the
nas
rdas
(
ref
.

.
furthermore
,
the
1980
and
1989
editions
of
the
nas
rdas
provided
esaddis
for
chloride
,
manganese
,
fluoride
,
chromium
,
and
molybdenum
.
now
that
the
moratorium
established
by
the
ds
act
has
expired
,
the
agency
is
proposing
elsewhere
in
this
issue
of
the
federal
register
to
establish
rdis
for
all
nutrients
for
which
rdas
or
esaddis
are
provided
in
the
1980
and
1989
editions
of
the
nass
recommended
dietary
allowances

for
which
rdis
or

have
not
been
established
by
fda
.
once
rdis
are
established
for
these
additional
seven
nutrients
,
nutrient
content
claims
may
be
made
for
them

fda
intends
to
consider
revising
all
of

to
the
most
recent
levels

however

aware

the
issue
of
whether
values
should
be
selected
to
prevent
deficiencies
or
to
promote
optimal
wellness
.
the
agency
believes
that
its
action
should
await
completion
of
the
nas
process
.
fda
is
committed
to
working
with
nas
to
help
resolve
this
issue
.
accordingly
,
as
stated
in
response
to
comment
number
1
above
,
fda
has
concluded
that
it
is
not
possible
to
define
nutrient
content
claims
for
nutrients
for
which
no
reliable
reference
standards
such
as
the
rdis
and
drvs
have
been
established
.
the
agency
believes
that
authorization
for
nutrient
content
claims
for
nutrients
for
which
no
rdi
or
drv
exists
(
eg
,
vitamin
k
)
needs
to
be
deferred
until
rdis
or
drvs
are
adopted
.
in
the
interim
,
quantitative
nutrient
information
may
be
listed
in
the
nutrition
label
as
discussed
in
the
final
rule
on
general
requirements
for
nutrition
labeling
for
dietary
supplements
published
elsewhere
in
this
issue
of
the
federal
register
.
.
also
,
manufacturers
may
provide
amount
or
percentage
statements
as
described
in
§
101
13
)
for
those
nutrients
that
do
not
have
rdis
or
drvs
.
for
example
,
while
there
is
no
rdi
for
fluoride
,
under
this
provision
,
manufacturers
may
declare
the
amount
of
the
nutrient
present
(
eg
,
2
mg
fluoride
)
on
any
panel
outside
of
the
nutrition

box
.

one
comment
stated
that
claims
should
be
permitted
for
beta
-
carotene
.
the
agency
believes
that
claims
regarding
beta
-
carotene
(
eg
,
`
contains
beta
-
carotene
)
are
claims
about
an
ingredient
that
make
implied
representations
about
the
level
of
vitamin
a
that
is
present
in
the
food
as
beta
-
carotene
.
this
conclusion
is
consistent
with
section
403r1a
)
of
the
act
,
which
states
that
a
food
can
be
misbranded
by
a
statement
that
expressly
or
by
implication
characterizes
the
level
of
a
nutrient
in
a
food
.
the
agency
considers
that
the
claim
`
contains
beta
-
carotene
'
implies
that
there
is
enough
beta
-
carotene
in
the
food
to
constitute
a
`
good
source
'
of
vitamin
a
(
ie
,
it
contains
10
percent
or
more
of
the
dv
for
vitamin
a
from
beta
-
carotene
.
such
a
claim
is
provided
for
in
§
101
65
.

one
comment
advocated
defining
nutrient
content
claims
for
ultratrace
nutrients
including
boron
,
silicon
,
vanadium
,
arsenic
,
and

.
the
comment
stated
that
claims
about

on
the
basis
of
the

,
esaddi
,
or
the

additionally
,
this
comment
argued
that

values
should
be

once
reputable
scientific
evidence
is
established
that
such
nutrients
serve
important
metabolic
or

functions
in

the
comment
also
suggested
that

the

no

while

the

not

also
on

fda
does
not
agree
with
the
comments
that
it
is
desirable
to
base
label
reference
values
for
nutrient

claims
solely
on
individual
scientific
research

no
matter
how
current
,
or
solely
on

the
existence
of
such

does
not
mean
that
there
is
scientific
agreement
on
the
essentiality
of
the
nutrient
or
on
the
recommended
level
in
the
diet
.
should
agreement
on
the
essentiality
of
additional
nutrients
be
reached
,
timely
and
appropriate
changes
to
the
label
reference
values
can
be
made
through
fdas

however
,
as
stated
above
,
manufacturers
are
free
to
declare
the

or
choline

,
on
the
product
label
outside
of
the
`
nutrition

in

with
§

.
such
a
statement
of
amount
is
not
considered
to
characterize
the
level
of
the
nutrient
in
the
food
,
as
would
claims
such

.
one
comment
stated
that
although
no
rdis
have
been
established
for
certain
vitamins
and
minerals
,
nutrient
content
claims
could
be
based
on
reference
foods
that
are
recognized
sources
of
those
nutrients
.
for
example
,
the
label
could
state
that
`
brand
x
provides
more
vitamin
k
than
two
servings
of
cabbage
'
based
on
the
vitamin
k
content
of
the
reference
amount
for
vegetables
without
sauce
listed
in
§

12
,
table
2
.
the
agency
disagrees
.
until
a
reference
standard
is
established
there
is
no
basis
for
confidence
that
cabbage
is
a
good
source
of
vitamin
k
.
there
is
also
no
basis
for
confidence
that
the
amount
of
vitamin

in

be
the
subject
of
the
claim
is
nutritionally
significant

elsewhere

comment
encouraged
the
agency
to
maintain
the
proposed
definitions
for
`

'
and
`

'
for
dietary
supplements
.
the
comment
argued
that
a
higher
level
(
eg
,
40
percent
of
the
rdi
)
would
suggest
to
consumers
that
daily
nutrient
intakes
could
be
achieved
by
consuming
only
a
few
foods
,
which
is
inconsistent
with
dietary
guidelines
.
the
comment
maintained
that
if
a
new
higher
claim
level
was
adopted
for
supplements
,
it
would
likely
also
apply
to
foods
in
conventional
food
form
based
on
the
logic
of
the
proposal
for
nutrient
content
claims
for
dietary
supplements
(
ie
,
consistency
in
definitions
.
the
comment
stated
that
users
of
dietary
supplements
are
well
aware
of
the
elevated
nutrient
levels
in
these
products
,
and
that
a
new
paradigm
is
not
needed
to
inform
consumers
of
these
levels
.
on
the
other
hand
,
several
comments
did
not
support
the
proposal
to
use
the
same
definitions
for
`
good
source
'
and
`
high
'
claims
as
those
used
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
the
comments
argued
that
the
terms
`
good
source
'
and
`
high
'
should
not
carry
the
same
meaning
for
supplements
as
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
,
that
most
supplements
contain
at
least
100
percent
of
the
daily
value
for
most
of
the
nutrients
they
provide
,
and
that
consumers
expect
most
of
these
products
to
contain
at
least
100
percent
of
the
daily
value
.
the
comments
maintained
that
allowing
any

with
as
little
as
10
or
20
percent
of
the
rdi
to
carry
`
good

'
and
`
high
'
claims
would
confuse
and
mislead
consumers
.
one
comment
questioned
whether
it
is
appropriate
to
permit
the
use
of
these
nutrient
content
claims
on
vitamins
and
mineral
supplements
since
it
implies
that
supplements
are
comparable
to
,
and
acceptable
substitutes
for
,
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
the
comment
also
noted
that
nutrition
educators
feel
strongly
that
supplements
can
enhance
the
nutrient
intake
from
foods
in
conventional
food
form
but
can
never
replace
them
since
foods
in
conventional
food
form
provides
other
important
components
.
on
the
other
hand
,
many
comments
supported
the
proposal
to
extend
the
same
definitions
for
`
good
source
'
and
`
high
'
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
to
dietary
supplements
.
these
comments
emphasized
the
importance
of
consistency
in
definitions
to
assist
consumer
education
.
one
comment
requested
clarification
on
whether
the
terms
`
good
source
'
and
`
contains
'
will
be
permitted
for
dietary
supplements
.
the
comment
maintained
that
such
claims
provide
consumers
with
important
information
regarding
the
precise
content
of
various
nutrients
and
should
not
be
subject
to
discriminatory
treatment
solely
on
the
basis
of
whether
such
claims
are
made
for
a
nutrient
in
a
dietary
supplement
as
opposed
to
one
in
a
conventional
food
.
the
agency
has
reviewed
these
comments
and
is
not
persuaded
that
the
definition
of
the
terms
`
good
source
'
and
`
high
'
should
be
different
for
dietary
supplements
than
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
the
agency
finds
that
the
definitions
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
and
dietary
supplements
should
be
consistent
.
as
directed
by
the
1990
amendments
(
section

fda
defined
the
term

in

of
final
rule
on
nutrient

claims
,
the
agency
stated
that
the
term
`
good

'
may
be
used
to
describe
a
food
when
a
serving
of
the
food
contains
10
to
19
percent
of
the
rdi
or
the
drv
for
a
nutrient
.
likewise
,
the
agency
stated
that
the
term
`
high
'
may
be
used
to
describe
a
food
when
a
serving
contains
20
percent
or
more
of
the
rdi
or
the
drv
.
fda
concluded
that
the
use
of
these
terms
would
permit
a
sufficient
number
of
food
items
to
bear
`
good
source
'
and
`
high
'
claims
to
allow
consumers
to
use
the
claims
in
selecting
foods
that
are
better
sources
of
nutrients
(
58

while
fda
recognizes
that
under
the
present
definitions
,
most
,
if
not
all
,
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
,
minerals
,
potassium
,
and

would
qualify

the

does
not
agree
with
those
comments
that
argued
that
the
definitions

would
be
confusing
or
misleading
to

as

,
the
use
of

claims
increases

confidence
in
the
validity

fda
is
aware
of
no

alternate
conclusion

the
basic
principle
of
consistency
in
definitions
of
nutrient
content
claims
is
discussed
in
detail
in
comment
2
of
this
document
.
furthermore
,
the
agency
recognizes
that
consumers
expect
dietary
supplements
to
be
concentrated
sources
of
nutrients
.
consumer
studies
support
this
conclusion
(
refs
.
1
and
5
.
fda
acknowledges
that
the
terms
`
good
source
'
and
`
high
'
might
be
of
limited
utility
in
comparing
nutrient
content
among
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
because
virtually
the
entire
class
of
products
would
qualify
for
such
claims
.
however
,
these
terms
may
be
useful
for
some
single
source
dietary
supplements
of
calcium
,
biotin
,
or
fiber
or
for
multinutrient
preparations
containing
these
nutrients
.
these
nutrients
are
generally
found
in
dietary
supplements
at
levels
below
the
daily
value
.
additionally
,
fda
believes
that
these
terms
would
be
useful
in
highlighting
the
nutrient
content
of
some
herbs
and
other
similar
nutritional
substances
that
have
nutrients
at
levels
high
enough
to
qualify
for
the
definition
of
one
of
the
above
terms
.
for
these
reasons
,
the
agency
is
not
persuaded
to
preclude
the
use
of
these
terms
for
dietary
supplements
.
the
agency
agrees
with
the
comment
that
stated
that
dietary
supplements
cannot
replace
foods
in
conventional
food
form
in
all
respects
because
the
latter
foods
supply
other
important
components
.
however
,
fda
recognizes
that
dietary
supplements
can
be
a
useful
part
of
the
diet
for
those
who
wish
to
make
sure
that
they
consume
at
least
the
rdi
amount
for
all
vitamins
and
minerals
or
for
those
who
wish
to
increase
their
daily
intake
of
a
particular
substance
above
those
levels
that
are
ordinarily
available
from
conventional
foods
.
thus
,
fda
finds
that
use
of
these
terms
on
dietary
supplements
is
appropriate
.
fda
is
convinced
that
consistency
in
definitions
of
nutrient
content
claims
across
the
food
supply
is
necessary
.
consistency
facilitates
consumer
education
by
limiting
the
number
of
terms
that
the
public
must
learn
and
interpret
.
moreover
,
different
definitions
for
the
same
terms
for
dietary
supplements
and
foods
in
conventional
food
form
would
be
confusing
to
consumers
because
of
the
difficulties
inherent
in
learning
alternate
definitions
for
the
same
term
.
there
is
a
greater
chance
of
error
and
misinterpretation
when
several
definitions
must
be
learned
for
the
same
term
.
thus
,
different
definitions
would
likely
do
more
harm
than
good
.
accordingly
,
the
agency
concludes
that
the
proposed
definitions
for
`
good
source
'
and
`
high
'
are
appropriate
,
and
that
there
is
no
reason
to
define
the
terms
differently
for
dietary
supplements
.
the
agency
would
like
to
clarify
that
`
good
source
'
and
`
contains
'
as
defined

)
are
nutrient
content
claims
that
can
be
used
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
as
well
as
for
dietary
supplements
.
there
is
nothing
in
this
final
rule
that
states
that
the
use
of
these
terms
would
not
be
allowed
for
dietary
supplements

comment

consumers
who

have
no

than

the
comment
acknowledged
that
consumers
might
also
be
confused
if
`
high
'
had
one
meaning
when
the
claim
appears
on

of
dietary

and
a
different
meaning
when
the
claim
appears
on

to
avoid
that
inconsistency
,
the
comment
urged
fda
to
prohibit
the
claims
`
good
source
'
and
`
high
'
on
supplements
.
further
,
the
comment
suggested
that
the
agency
should
define
the
term
`
high
potency
'
and
allow
it
to
be
used
only
on
supplements
.
fda
disagrees
that
the
terms
`
good
source
'
and
`
high
'
should
be
prohibited
on
the
labels
of
dietary
supplements
.
the
agency
recognizes
that
a
claim
of
`
high
'
will
not
specifically
identify
those
products
that
have
levels
of
nutrients
that
exceed
the
rdi
.
however
,
the
quantitative
amount
of
a
nutrient
in
a
dietary
supplement
is
often
a
part
of
the
statement
of
identity
for

may
also
be
found
in

or
percentage
statements
on
the
principal

panel
.
in
addition
,
as
a
result
of
the
agencys
new
format
requirements
,
the
nutrition
label
for
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
provides
quantitative
information
on
the
levels
of
specific
nutrients
as
well
as
the
percent
dv
for
each
nutrient
in
a
more
legible
format
.
consequently
,
consumers
will
have
easy
access
to
information
regarding
the
levels
of
specific
nutrients
and
may
adjust
their
levels
of
intake
accordingly
.
further
,
as
discussed
in
the
previous
comment
,
while
the
terms
`
good
source
'
and
`
high
'
may
be
of
limited
utility
for
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
,
these
terms
may
be
useful
in
highlighting
the
nutritional
content
of
single
nutrients
,
such
as
biotin
and
calcium
,
that
are
generally
found
in
products
at
levels
well
below
the
rdi
,
as
well
as
of
dietary
supplements
of
herbs
and
other
similar
nutritional
products
.
therefore
,
fda
concludes
that
precluding
the
use
of
these
terms
on
dietary
supplements
is
unjustified
.
however
,
fda
believes
that
there
is
a
sufficient
basis
to
consider
defining
the
term
`
high
potency
'
or
some
similar
term
as
a
nutrient
content
claim
.
fdas
tentative
view
is
that
this
term
,
or
a
similar
term
when
defined
,
could
provide
a
way
for
manufacturers
to
describe
the
higher
levels
of
nutrients
in
dietary
supplements
.

one
comment
stated
that
consumers
could
be
misled
if
comparative
claims
are
made
among
high
potency
vitamin
mineral
supplements
.
the
comment
stated
that
if
,
for
example
,
one
brand
of
300mg
vitamin
b6
tablets
claimed
that
it
contained
`
more
'
than
a
competitive
250mg
product
,
then
the
consumer
may
get
the
misleading
impression
that
the
former
product
is
better
.
the
comment
maintained
that
as
customers
shop
for
supplements
,
they
will
be
able
to
readily
observe
whether
one
product
is
more
potent
than
another
without
label
claims
suggesting
superiority
of
one
over
another
.
if
such
a
claim
resulted
in
better
sales
,
then
a
`
horsepower
race
'
would
ensue
.
the
comment
recommended
that
`
more
'
claims
for
vitamins
and
minerals
not
be
allowed
if
the
nutrient
potency
of
the
reference
product
already
meets
or
exceeds
100
percent
of
the
daily
value
.
the
agency
acknowledges
that
there
is
the
possibility
that
some
manufacturers
may
choose
to
increase
potencies
in
order
to
make
a
`
more
'
claim
in
comparison
to
another
brand
,
but
the
agency
disagrees
that
the
limitation
suggested
by
the
comment
is
warranted
at
this
time
.
the
agency
points
out
that
`
more
'
claims
for
nutrients
with
an
rdi
or
drv
,
including
those
products
with
nutrients
in
megadoses
,
such
as
those
in
the
example
cited
by
the
comment
,
must
include
the
following
information
:
the
percentage
(
or
fraction
)
that
the
nutrient
was
increased
relative
to
the
rdi
or
drv
,
the
identity
of
the
reference
food
,
and
the
quantitative
amount
of
the
nutrient
present
(
eg
,
contains
`
20
percent
more
of
the
dv
for
vitamin
b6
per
tablet
than
product
`
x
.
the
vitamin
b6
content
of
product
`
x
'
is
250
mg
.
this
product
contains
300
mg
vitamin
b6
)
the
nutrition
label
of
a
product
containing
300
mg
of
vitamin
b6
must
state
that
the
product
contains
1500
percent
of
the
daily
value
.
the
agency
acknowledges
that
the
amount
of
information
required
to
make
a
`
more
'
claim
is
considerable
,
but
such
information
is
necessary
to
allow
consumers
to
readily
see
how
the
amount
of
a
nutrient
for
which
a
`
more
'
claim
is
made
fits
into
the
total
daily
diet
.
furthermore
,
fda
believes
that
the
concern
regarding
`
horsepower
races
'
in
dietary
supplements
stems
from
concerns
of
possible
unfair
marketing
among
manufacturers
as
well
as
from
safety
concerns
inherent
in
the
addition
of
very
high
levels
of
nutrients
to
supplements
.
similar
concerns
with
foods
in
conventional
food
form
led
to
the
establishment
of
fdas
fortification
policy
in
1980
.
this
policy
,
while
published
in
§

,
does
not
have
the
force
of
a
regulation
.
however
,
the
agency
has
not
found
evidence
of
widespread
`
horsepower
races
'
with
such
foods
.
the
agency
urges
industry
,
particularly
industry
associations
,
to
develop
standards
regarding
nutrient
levels
and
to
monitor
compliance
with
those
standards
to
minimize
any

.
one
comment
from
a
trade
association
stated
that
the
literal
reading
of
section
411b2b
)
of
the
act
prohibits
giving
prominence
on
the
label
of
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
or
minerals
to
ingredients
that
are
not
vitamins
or
minerals
.
the
comment
argued
that
these
prohibitions
result
in
the
withholding
of
information
that
is
of
interest
to
consumers
,
and
that
it
is
increasingly
common
for
manufacturers
to
market
products
that
offer
a
combination
of
vitamins
,
minerals
,
herbs
,
and
other
dietary
substances
.
the
comment
stated
that
the
principal
reason
for
the
purchase
of
these
products
is
not
their
vitamin
and
mineral
content
but
the
other
ingredients
.
the
comment
invited
fda
to
join
the
supplement
industry
in
seeking
an
amendment
to
section
411
of
the
act
that
will
remedy
this
problem
.
another
comment
disagreed
with
fdas
interpretation
of
section
411b2b
)
of
the
act
and
suggested
that
this
section
merely
prohibits
giving
prominence
or
emphasis
to
such
ingredients
.
the
comment
argued
that
nutrients
other
than
vitamins
and
minerals
or
sources
of
vitamins
and
minerals
should
be
permitted
to
appear
outside
or
immediately
following
the
nutrition
label
,
providing
that
such
information
is
not
emphasized
by
,
for
example
,
being
presented
in
type
size
greater
than
that
used
in
the
nutrition
label
.
the
comment
stated
that
such
limited
declarations
would
not
conflict
with
current
provisions
of
the
act
and
would
be
fair
and
reasonable
means
of
communicating
about
the
presence
of
ingredients
that
provide
added
value
to
many
dietary
supplement
products
.
the
agency
is
persuaded
by
these
comments
that
a
clarification
of
those
sections
of
the
proposal
relating
to
section
411b2b
)
of
the
act
is
needed
.
section
411b2b
)
of
the
act
states
that
the
labeling
and
advertising
for
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
may
not
give
prominence
to
or
emphasize
ingredients
that
are
not
vitamins
,
minerals
,
or
represented
as
a
source
of
vitamins
or
minerals
.
because
of
this
provision
,
nutrient
content
claims
about
ingredients
that
are
not
vitamins
or

(
eg
,
`
more
fiber
'
`

)
may
not
be
made
on

of
vitamins
or
minerals
.
it
must
be
emphasized
that
this
provision
pertains
only
to
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
.
if
,
for
example
,
an
herbal
extract
includes
vitamins
and
minerals
but
is
labeled
as
an
herbal
extract
,
in
compliance
with
§
1019
and
other
applicable
provisions
,
and
is
advertised
as
such
,
section
411b2b
)
of
the
act
would
not
apply
.
the
same
is
true
for
a
product
that
is
primarily
a
protein
supplement
.
a
protein
supplement
with
added
vitamins
and
minerals
that
is
labeled
and
advertised
as
a
protein
supplement
could
declare
that
it
is
high
in
fiber
.
such
claims
are
permissible
as
long
as
they
are
made
in
accordance
with
section
403r
)
of
the
act
,
and
they
are
not
false
or
misleading
in
any
particular
.
however
,
section
411b2b
)
of
the
act
makes
clear
that
in
the
labeling
and
advertising
of
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
,
ingredients
other
than
vitamins
or
minerals
cannot
be
emphasized
or
given
prominence
.
fda
interprets
prominence
not
solely
as
a
function
of
type
size
.
declaring
an
ingredient
outside
or
immediately
following
the
nutrition
label
is
another
means
of
giving
prominence
.
for
example
,
a
statement
such
as
`
5
g
psyllium
'
except
in
extremely
limited
circumstances
,
cannot
be
made
on
the
principal
display
panel
,
outside
the
nutrition
label
,
or
immediately
following
the
nutrition
label
of
a
dietary
supplement
of
vitamins
and
minerals
because
such
placements
give
prominence
to
that
ingredient
.
however
,
the
declaration
of
psyllium
in
the
ingredient
list
would
not
be
construed
as
giving
prominence
to
that
ingredient
.
on
the
other
hand
,
`
5
g
psyllium
'
could
be
declared
in
an
amount
statement
on
the
principal
display
panel
,
outside
,
or
immediately
following
the
nutrition
label
on
protein
supplements
,
on
dietary
supplements
of
herbal
extracts
,
and
on
dietary
supplements
of
other
similar
nutritional
substances
so
long
as
these
dietary
supplements
are
not
subject
to
section
411
of
the
act
.
fda
advises
that
if
a
sugar
is
an
ingredient
in
a
dietary
supplement
of
vitamins
or
minerals
,
claims
about
the
amount
of
sugar
actually
in
the
product
would
have
to
be
restricted
.
however
,
`
sugarfree
sugar
free
'
and
`
no
added
sugar
'
are
absence
claims
that
assert
that
sugar
is
not
an
ingredient
.
the
agency
concludes
that
the
use
of
these
terms
is
acceptable
on
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
or
minerals
,
as
well
as
on
other
types
of
dietary
supplements
.
in
view
of
this
clarification
,
the
agency
believes
that
section
411b2b
)
of
the
act
,
as
written
,
is
sufficiently
flexible
to
accommodate
claims
on
products
that
are
not
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
or
minerals
.
fda
believes
that
it
is
therefore
unnecessary

that
weigh
slightly

not

and
therefore
,

sugar
free
'
the
comment
suggested
that
the
term
`

free
'
on
a
dietary

should
mean
a
much
lower
amount
of
sugars
,
or
that
the

the

fda
is
not

that

as

result

even
frequent

not

fda

that
there

be
situations
in
which
a

may
contain
a
significant
proportion
of
sugars
on
a
weight

be
able
to
make

claim

the
product

less
than

its
net
contribution

would
be
inconsequential

additionally
,
fda
considers

serves
as
a
source
of

and
(

)
the
product
bears
a
statement
that
the
food
is
not
`
low
calorie
'
or
`
calorie
reduced
'
(
unless
the
food
meets
the
requirements
for
a
`
low
'
or
`
reduced
calorie
'
food
)
and
that
directs
consumers
'
attention
to
the
nutrition
label
for
further
information
on
sugar
and
calorie
content
.
as
is
the
case
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
,
the
agency
believes
that
to
avoid
misleading
consumers
,
the
term
`
no
added
sugar
'
should
be
limited
to
dietary
supplements
that
would
be
expected
to
contain
added
sugars
.
the
agency
advises
that
the
purpose
of
a
`
no
added
sugar
'
claim
is
to
identify
a
food
that
differs
from
a
similar
food
because
it
does
not
contain
the
added
sugars
that
would
normally
be
present
in
the
similar
food
.
for
this
provision
to
be
of
practical
benefit
to
consumers
,
it
must
preclude
the
use
of
the
claim
on
a
food
where
the
sugars
that
are
normally
added
are
replaced
with
an
ingredient
that
contains
sugars
that
functionally
substitute
for
the
added
sugars
.
thus
,
the
agency
concludes
that
the
use
of
any
ingredient
that
contains
sugars
that
would
normally
be
added
to
a
food
precludes
the
use
of
the
`
no
added
sugar
'
nutrient
content
claim
.
the
agency
believes
that
claims
concerning
the
absence
of
added
sugars
on
products
that
would
not
normally
contain
added
sugar
(
eg
,
dietary
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
for
adults
)
are
likely
to
mislead
consumers
into
thinking
that
a
particular
brand
may
be
more
desirable
when
compared
to
other
brands
of
the
same
product
.
fda
acknowledges
that
consumers
may
not
know
every
type
of
product
that
could
be
expected
to
contain
sugar
.
however
,
the
final
rule
on
nutrition
labeling
for
dietary
supplements
published
elsewhere
in
this
issue
of
the
federal
register
specifies
that
sugars
will
be
listed
in
the
ingredient
label
and
must
be
declared
in
the
nutrition
label
if
present
in
more
than
insignificant
amounts
.
through
these
provisions
the
consumer
can
readily
ascertain
which
products
contain

in

on

for

the
agency
tentatively
concluded
that
this

is
applicable
to
dietary

and
requested
comment
on
other
examples
that
are
appropriate
for

comments
suggested
that
other
examples
of

in
this

include
the
following
:

,
corn

,
yeast
free
,
starch
free
,
milk
free
,
egg
free
,

free
,
no
artificial

,
nonirradiated
,
and
no
synthetic

.
the
comments
requested
that
fda
confirm
that
these
statements
are
allowed
on
the
label
.
none
of
the
terms
that
were
submitted
in
the
comments
other
than
`
egg
free
'
would
constitute
nutrient
content
claims
.
the
term
`
egg
free
'
can
be
interpreted
as
an
implied
claim
about
cholesterol
.
the
agency
points
out
that
it
does
not
currently
have
a
definition
for
`
artificial
'
except
as
that
term
applies
to
flavors
and
colors
.
similarly
,
it
has
no
definition
for
`
synthetic
'
except
as
that
term
applies
to
flavors
and
colors
.
although
these
terms
have
not
been
defined
by
fda
,
the
agency
believes
that
they
are
not
nutrient
content
claims
unless
they
are
used
in
a
context
in
which
they
explicitly
or
implicitly
describe
the
level
of
a
nutrient
.
however
,
even
if
these
terms
are
not
nutrient
content
claims
,
manufacturers
who
use
them
must
make
sure
that
their
use
is
not
false
or
misleading
.

.
fda
proposed
to
include
dietary
supplements
in
the
coverage
of
§
101
65
.
this
section
states
that
when
an
ingredient
constitutes
essentially
100
percent
of
a
food
,
so
that
the
name
of
the
ingredient
is
the
statement
of
identity
,
the
name
of
the
ingredient
generally
does
not
constitute
an
implied
nutrient
content
claim
unless
it
is
used
in
a
context
to
suggest
that
a
nutrient
is
absent
or
present
in
a
certain
amount
.
fda
used
a
statement
of
identity
for
a
dietary
supplement
in
which
an
ingredient
constitutes
essentially
100
percent
of
a
supplement
(
eg
.
`
60
mgvitamin
c
)
as
an
example
.
one
comment
pointed
out
that
60
mg
vitamin
c
tablets
contain
excipients
(
fillers
,
binders
,
lubricants
,
disintegrants
)
other
than
vitamin
c
.
the
comment
requested
clarification
as
to
whether
,
in
the
example
of
vitamin
c
tablets
,
§
101
65
)
requires
that
the
amount
claimed
in
the
statement
of
identity
constitute
100
percent
of
the
claimed
amount
of
a
food
in
§
101
65
.
in
the
example
added
to
§
101
65
,
the
amount
refers
to
the
claimed
nutrient
.
a
tablet
stating
`
60
mgvitamin
c
tablets
'
should
contain
60
mg
of
that
nutrient
.
the
agency
recognizes
that
a
nutrient
will
not
constitute
precisely
100
percent
of
some
dietary
supplements
,
such
as
vitamin
tablets
or
capsules
,
and
advises
that
small
amounts
of
excipients
,
binders
,
lubricants
,
or
disintegrants
added
for
technological
purposes
are
allowable
in
addition
to
the
stated
nutrient
content
.
additionally
,
fda
points
out
that
under
§
1013c
,
if
a
food
is
marketed
in
various
optional
forms
,
the
particular
form
is
a
necessary
part
of
the
statement
of
identity
.
because
vitamin
c
is
marketed
in
tablet
,
capsule
,
and
liquid
form
,
the
form
is
part
of
the
name
.
therefore
,
this
food
should
be
called
`
60
mgvitamin
mg
vitamin
c
tablets
'
the
agency
acknowledges
an
error
in
this
regard
in
the
proposal
and
is
revising
§
101
65
)
to
make
the
correction
.
22
.
one
comment
stated
that
it
is
not
unusual
for
a
dietary
supplement
to
contain
several
nutrients
of
one
type
and
a
single
nutrient
of
another
type
,
such
as
`
multiplevitamins
multiple
vitamins
with
iron
'
the
comment
requested
confirmation
that
`
with
iron
'
would
not
represent
an
implied
nutrient
content
claim
.
the
agency
advises
that
a
term
such
as
`
with
iron
'
when
used
on
the
statement
of
identity
of
a
supplement
,
is
intended
to
describe
the
nature
of
the
food
.
when
a
statement
of
identity
simply
states
`
with
iron
'
or
specifies
the
amount
of
iron
in
a
product
(
eg
,
`
multivitamin
with
15
mg
iron
,
the
statement
is
not
a
nutrient
content
claim
.
such
statements
fall
under
§
101
65
.
however
,
as
the
agency
stated
in
§
101
65
,
there
may
be
cases
in
which
other
statements
on
the
label
or
labeling
would
have
the
effect
of
making
the
statement
into
a
nutrient
content
claim
.
for
example
,
if
the
labeling
of
a
multivitamin
with
iron
includes
a
discussion
of
the
importance
of
iron
in
the
diet
,
fda
believes
the
statement
`
with
iron
'
would
be
an
implied
claim
that
the
multivitamin
is
a
good
source
of
iron
.
if
the
labeling
is
devoid
of
such
information
,
fda
would
be
unlikely
to
consider
the
name
to
be
an
implied
nutrient
content
claim
.
the
agency
will
evaluate
such
claims
on
a
casebycase
case
by
case
basis
in
the
context
of
the
entire
label
and
labeling
to
determine
whether
they
are
nutrient
content
claims
.
23
.
one
comment
maintained
that
fda
failed
to
address
whether
the
currently
used
claim
of
`
high
in
antioxidants
'
was
within
the
scope
of
the
proposed
regulation
.
while
the
term
`
high
in
antioxidants
'
was
not
explicitly
discussed
in
the
proposed
regulations
for
nutrient
content
claims
for
dietary
supplements
,
the
agency
considers
it
to
be
an
implied
nutrient
content
claim
that
would
come
under
§
101
65
.
fdas
view
is
that
this
claim
implies
that
the
food
on
which
it
appears
contains
a
`
high
'
amount
(
ie
,
at
least
20
percent
of
the
rdi
,
see
§
101
54
)
of
each
antioxidant
.
one
problem
with
this
claim
,
however
,
is
that
there
is
no
established
definition
of
`
antioxidants
'
fda
believes
that
a
logical
place
to
start
in
defining
this
term
is
section
3b1ax
)
of
the
1990
amendments
.
that
provision
directed
fda
to
determine
whether
a
health
claim
on
antioxidant
vitamins
and
cancer
,
could
be
authorized
under
the
standard
that
it
established
for
dietary
supplements
under
section
403r5d
)
of
the
act
.
in
its
proposed
regulations
to
implement
the
1990
amendments
,
in
response
to
this
provision
,
fda
considered
the
effects
of
vitamin
c
,
vitamin
e
,
and
beta
-
carotene
on
cancer
because
these
nutrients
are
the
vitamins
or
provitamins
that
function
as
antioxidants
(
56
fr
60624
,
11/27/1991
.
in
the
final
rule
on
antioxidant
vitamins
and
cancer
,
fda
concluded
that
its
selection
of
these
nutrients
was
appropriate
(
58
fr
2622
,
01/06/1993
.
thus
,
the
agency
has
determined
that
the
directacting
direct
acting
antioxidant
vitamins
or
provitamins
include
vitamin
c
,
vitamin
e
,
and
beta
-
carotene
.
based
on
its
review
of
the
information
presented
at
a
recent
conference
entitled
`
antioxidant
vitamins
and
cancer
and
cardiovascular
disease
'
which
was
initiated
by
fda
,
the
agency
is
not
aware
of
any
basis
to
expand
this
list
because
the
biological
role
of
other
vitamins
as
direct
antioxidants
has
not
been
confirmed
(
ref
.
3
.
while
it
is
arguable
that
fda
could
authorize
`
high
in
antioxidants
'
as
an
implied
claim
pertaining
to
antioxidant
vitamins
as
a
logical
outgrowth
of
the
proposal
,
because
the
claim
applies
to
foods
in
conventional
food
form
as
well
as
to
dietary
supplements
,
the
agency
believes
that
the
better
course
is
to
propose
to
authorize
such
a
claim
.
in
addition
,
the
definition
of
`
antioxidants
'
is
not
free
from
controversy
.
the
agency
is
aware
,
based
on
its
review
of
dietary
supplements
whose
labeling
currently
includes
a
`
high
in
antioxidant
'
claim
,
that
some
manufacturers
view
this
term
as
including
certain
minerals
.
antioxidant
minerals
have
not
been
addressed
by
the
agency
,
and
,
therefore
,
final
rules
implementing
the
1990
amendments
do
not
provide
for
claims
about
them
.
thus
,
fda
finds
that
a
rulemaking
on
the
definition
of
`
antioxidants
'
will
provide
an
opportunity
to
establish
the
precise
meaning
of
this
term
.
consequently
,
fda
intends
to
address
this
issue
as
quickly
as
possible
in
a
forthcoming
proposal
.
given
that
,
elsewhere
in
this
issue
of
the
federal
register
,
,
the
agency
is
establishing
a
date
of
applicability
of
07/05/1995
,
for
this
regulation
,
fda
anticipates
that
there
is
sufficient
time
to
take
final
action
on
such
a
proposal
before
that
date

that
a

the
comments
stated
that
it
is
inappropriate
and
fraught
with
possibilities
for
deception
to
allow
each
manufacturer
to
define
such
claims
.
one
comment
stated
that
although
these
terms
imply
features
of
nutrient
content
to
consumers
,
they
do
not
have
any
established
or
useful
meaning
with
regard
to
dietary
supplements
.
the
comment
argued
that
these
terms
seem
to
be
more
specific
to
dietary
supplements
than
to
other
food
,
so
that
their
applicability
in
helping
consumers
make
appropriate
nutritional
choices
from
the
variety
of
foods
available
seems
limited
.
on
the
other
hand
,
several
comments
stated
that
these
terms
do
not
inherently
refer
to
the
level
of
nutrients
,
are
not
nutrient
content
claims
,
and
therefore
should
not
be
defined
.
these
comments
maintained
that
such
terms
are
formulation
descriptions
,
which
properly
and
truthfully
describe
the
nature
and
type
of
the
product
.
these
comments
contended
that
these
terms
have
been
used
for
many
years
,
and
that
consumers
have
come
to
understand
that
products
so
described
provide
an
amount
of
the
primary
nutrients
in
the
formulation
that
is
at
least
equal
to
the
rdas
for
those
nutrients
.
one
comment
argued
that
fda
precedent
exists
for
excluding
such
terms
from
regulation
as
nutrient
content
claims
.
the
comment
stated
that
as
formulation
descriptions
,
these
terms
are
useful
to
consumers
in
helping
them
to
make
product
choices
,
and
manufacturers
should
be
allowed
to
continue
to
use
these
terms
in
a
manner
that
is
consistent
with
fdas
policy
on
claims
such
as
`
maximum
strength
'
for
internal
analgesics
in
the
overthecounter
the
counter
drug
review
(
ie
,
kept
outside
the
scope
of
this
rulemaking
.
the
agency
agrees
that
these
terms
seem
to
have
more
direct
application
to
dietary
supplements
than
to
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
furthermore
,
these
terms
may
have
some
utility
in
helping
consumers
select
among
dietary
supplements
.
however
,
while
these
terms
have
apparently
been
used
for
years
to
imply
superiority
,
the
agency
is
uncertain
what
they
mean
to
consumers
.
the
agency
disagrees
that
these
terms
should
be
regulated
in
the
same
manner
as
terms
such
as
`
maximum
strength
'
which
are
used
on
the
labels
of
overthecounter

therefore
,
the

the
agency
believes
that
each
of
these

should
be
evaluated
individually
because
they
do
not

for

'
26
.
the
majority
of
comments
stated
that
the
term
`
high
potency
'
or
`
full
potency
'
is
an
implied
nutrient
content
claim
and
should
be
defined
.
several
definitions
were
offered
for
this
term
.
a
few
comments
stated
that
multivitamins
and
minerals
are
termed
`
high
potency
'
when
the
majority
of
nutrients
with
established
rdas
are
present
at
the
levels
equal
to
or
in
excess
of
the
rda
.
similarly
,
another
comment
stated
that
the
term
should
be
restricted
to
formulations
that
contain
micronutrients
at
levels
of
at
least
twice
the
applicable
rdi
or
drv
because
a
multivitamin
at
100
percent
of
the
dv
might
be
`
high
potency
'
compared
to
a
food
in
conventional
food
form
but
not
`
high
potency
'
when
compared
to
other
dietary
supplements
.
another
comment
suggested
that
fda
should
require
a
`
high
potency
'
singleingredient
single
ingredient
supplement
to
contain
at
least
twice
the
rdi
,
and
that
the
front
of
the
label
should
disclose
what
multiple
of
the
rdi
the
supplement
contains
.
the
comment
acknowledged
that
under
this
scheme
,
some
nutrients
,
such
as
calcium
and
selenium
,
would
not
qualify
to
carry
a
`
high
potency
'
claim
,
because
they
are
rarely
sold
at
double
the
rdi
.
the
comment
suggested
that
if
the
supplement
industry
begins
to
market
those
supplements
at
higher
doses
in
order
to
make
`
high
potency
'
claims
,
then
fda
could
establish
a
lower
minimum
level
,
such
as
50
percent
more
than
the
rdi
for
selenium
or
50
percent
of
the
rdi
for
calcium
.
those
minimum
levels
would
apply
to
those
nutrients
only
.
the
comment
also
suggested
that
fda
should
allow
`
high
potency
'
claims
on
multinutrient
supplements
when
more
than
onethird
one
third
of
the
nutrients
that
they
contain
meet
the
minimum
level
required
for
a
high
potency
claim
,
and
the
label
discloses
which
nutrients
are
present
at
high
levels
.
for
example
,
the
label
of
a
`
high
potency
'
multivitamin
could
carry
an
asterisk
next
to
the
claim
,
with
the
following
disclosure
:
`
contains
high
levels
of
[
number
]
vitamins
'
further
,
the
comment
stated
that
it
is
not
reasonable
to
require
that
all
of
the
nutrients
in
a
multinutrient
supplement
be
present
at
levels
that
are
necessary
for
high
potency
claims
because
many
nutrients
are
notand
should
notbe
sold
in
such
high
doses
.
for
example
,
the
comment
suggested
that
`
high
potency
'
claims
should
be
allowed
on
a
multivitaminandmineral
multivitamin
and
mineral
supplement
that
contains
at
least
double
the
rdi
of
vitamins
a
,
c
,
e
,
b6
,
b12
,
thiamin
,
riboflavin
,
and
niacin
but
smaller
amounts
of
vitamin
d
,
iron
,
calcium
,
magnesium
,
zinc
,
and
copper
.
the
comment
stated
that
the
latter
nutrients
are
typically
sold
at
doses
lower
than
double
the
rdi
and
may
pose
a
risk
at
high
levels
.
fda
has
reviewed
the
comments
and
is
persuaded
that
`
high
potency
'
is
a
claim
that
characterizes
the
level
of
a
nutrient
and
therefore
meets
the
definition
in
§
101
13
)
of
a
nutrient
content
claim
.
fda
also
is
persuaded
by
the
comments
that
this
is
a
term
that
fda
should
define
in
order
to
ensure
that
it
will
be
useful
to
consumers
in
maintaining
healthy
dietary
practices
.
however
,
given
the
range
and
diversity
of
the
suggested
definitions
,
the
agency
is
not
prepared
to
offer
a

'
27
.
a
couple
of
comments
stated
that
the
term
`
high
absorption
'
does
not
refer
to
the
level
of
nutrients
but
rather
to
bioavailability
or
how
efficiently
the
nutrients
are
released
from
the
product
and
absorbed
into
the
bloodstream
.
one
comment
stated
that
`
high
absorption
'
means
that
the
product
meets
the
definition
for
`
high
'
and
that
a
`
high
amount
'
is
digested
and
assimilated
.
another
comment
stated
that
from
a
biological
viewpoint
,
the
extent
to
which
nutrients
are
absorbed
from
food
or
supplements
depends
not
only
on
the
chemical
form
of
the
nutrient
itself
but
on
the
chemical
environment
presented
by
the
carrier
food
in
which
it
is
contained
and
on
the
physiological
state
of
nutrient
need
of
the
individual
consumer
.
given
these
factors
,
the
comment
stated
that
it
is
difficult
to
provide
a
meaningful
definition
of
absorbability
.
one
comment
requested
that
the
label
should
disclose
information
about
the
bioavailability
of
the
product
.
another
comment
suggested
that
fda
should
allow
labels
to
make
`
high
absorption
'
or
similar
claims
only
when
the
manufacturer
supplies
bioavailability
data
showing
that
the
product
is
better
absorbed
than
a
standard
supplement
.
the
comment
stated
that
the
agency
should
not
allow
this
claim
on
supplements
that
simply
meet
or
exceed
the
united
states
pharmacopeial
conventions
(
usps
)
(
or
other
)
standards
for
disintegration
or
dissolution
,
because
meeting
those
standards
does
not
ensure
that
the
product
is
well
absorbed
.
the
agency
agrees
that
the
term
`
high
absorption
'
generally
refers
to
how
well
a
nutrient
is
absorbed
into
the
system
.
a
product
can
be
well
absorbed
irrespective
of
the
quantitative
amount
found
in
the
product
.
accordingly
,
fda
finds
that
`
high
absorption
'
is
not
a
nutrient
content
claim
and
thus
will
not
define
this
term
.
the
use
of
this
term
is
subject
to
section
201n
)
and
403a
)
of
the
act
,
however
.
the
agency
expects
that
any
product
bearing
a
`
high
absorption
'
claim
will
contain
the
nutrients
that
are
the
subject
of
the
claim
in
a
form
than
can
be
readily
assimilated
by
the
body
.
in
addition
,
manufacturers
who
make
a
`
high
absorption
'
claim
should
have
data
available
to
support
the
claim
and
should
be
prepared
to
make
such
data
available
to
regulatory
officials
on
request
.
failure
to
do
so
could
lead
the
agency
to
conclude
that
there
is
no
basis
for
the
claim
,
and
thus
that
it
is
false
or
misleading

28
.
a
few
comments
stated
that
`
balanced
'
is
not
a
nutrient
content
claim
.
one
comment
suggested
that
`
balanced
'
refers
to
the
ratio
of
nutrients
,
not
the
level
,
and
that
the
term
can
apply
equally
to
products
containing
low
or
high
quantities
of
nutrients
.
another
comment
stated
that
there
is
little
need
for
fda
to
define
`
balanced
'
because
most
multinutrient
supplements
that
are
currently
on
the
market
do
not
contain
nutrients
in
proportions
that
would
impair
the
absorption
or
utilization
of
other
nutrients
.
the
comment
suggested
that
until
researchers
gain
further
information
on
the
most
favorable
proportions
of
nutrients
in
supplements
,
the
agency
should
leave
this
term
undefined
and
therefore
prohibited
.
another
comment
suggested
that
`
balanced
'
be
defined
as
any
supplement
containing
from
50
to
150
percent
of
the
rdi
for
each
vitamin
and
mineral
component
of
the
product
for
which
an
rdi
has
been
established
.
the
agency
is
persuaded
by
the
comments
that
the
term
`
balanced
'
does
not
typically
characterize
the
level
of
nutrients
,
but
rather
that
it
is
a
formulation
claim
that
addresses
the
ratio
of
nutrients
.
the
term
`
balanced
'
may
be
used
in
different
ways
,
each
of
which
relates
to
the
formulation
of
a
product
.
for
example
,
the
term
`
balanced
'
may
refer
to
the
assortment
of
nutrients
that
are
present
in
a
product
,
or
it
may
reflect
interactions
between
the
nutrients
present
,
such
as
sparing
effects
or
impairment
or
enhancement
of
absorption
.
accordingly
,
this
term
does
not
meet
the
definition
for
a
nutrient
content
claim
in
§
101
13
.
therefore
,
the
use
of
the
term

one
comment
stated
that
use
of
the
terms

'
`
high
absorption
'
and
`
balanced
'
should
not
be
suspended
temporarily
during
the

process
because
such
a
suspension
would
result
in
unnecessary

.
another
comment
requested
additional
time
to
comment
on
the
definition
of
`
high
potency
'
and
suggested
that
until
fda
defines
this
term
,
the
agency
should
permit
dietary
supplement
manufacturers
to
continue
to
use
this
term
as
it
is
currently
being
used
.
the
comment
suggested
that
as
an
executive
agency
,
fda
has
inherent
authority
to
refrain
from
enforcing
a
statutory
provision
in
circumstances
in
which
the
enforcement
would
do
more
harm
than
good
.
the
comment
argued
that
to
the
extent
that
`
high
potency
'
is
being
used
as
part
of
a
brand
name
(
and
was
being
used
before
10/25/1989
,
the
1990
amendments
permit
its
continued
use
in
the
brand
name
until
fda
has
defined
the
term
(
section
403r2c
)
of
the
act
.
the
comment
argued
that
there
is
no
reason
for
fda
to
prohibit
the
use
of
a
nutrient
content
claim
while
a
definition
is
being
developed
.
further
,
the
comment
noted
that
an
enforcement
moratorium
would
avoid
the
relabeling
problem
that
would
arise
if
fda
disapproves
and
then
reapproves
use
of
the
term
within
a
short
period
of
time
.
the
comment
stated
that
fda
will
continue
to
have
authority
to
prohibit
use
of
the
term
when
such
use
is
false
or
misleading
.
fda
advises
that
it
intends
to
define
`
high
potency
'
as
a
nutrient
content
claim
in
a
separate
rulemaking
as
quickly
as
possible
.
the
agency
is
postponing
the
date
that
it
will
apply
this
final
rule
on
nutrient
content
claims
on
dietary
supplements
until
07/01/1995

this
postponement
is
discussed
in
detail
in
the
document
on
the
date
of
application
for
the
nutrition
labeling
and
nutrient
content
claim
requirements
for
dietary
supplements
found
elsewhere
in
this
issue
of
the
federal
register

.
fda
intends
to
complete
its
rulemaking
on
`

in
sufficient
time
to
assure
implementation
by
the
time
that
dietary
supplement
manufacturers
will
be
required
to
comply
with
the
nutrient
content
claim
provisions
.
the
agency
also
advises
that
the
term
`
high
potency
'
when
used
as
part
of
a
brand
name
,
would
fall
under
section
403r2c

of
the

,
if
as
the
comment
stated
,
it
was
used
as
part
of
the
brand
name
before
10/25/1989
.
however
,
once
this
term
is
defined
by
the
secretary
,
it
will
have
to
be
used
in
a
manner
that
complies
with
that
definition

,
use
of
the
term
in

which
prohibits
the
use
of
false
and
misleading
labeling
irrespective
of
whether
the

of
the
term
in
the
brand
name
is
exempt
under
section
403r2c

of
the
act
.
as
discussed
previously
,
the
comments
did
not
demonstrate
that
there
are
accepted
definitions
for
any
of
these
terms
.
however
,
the
comments
have
convinced
the
agency
that
the
terms
`
high
absorption
'
and
`
balanced
'
do
not
generally
characterize
the
level
of
nutrients
.
accordingly

with

that
imply
that

is
especially
useful
for
a
particular
segment
of

the
comment
argued
that
it
would
therefore
be
appropriate
for

to
require
that
these
special

comply
with
clearly
defined
requirements
(
eg

that
they
contain

minerals

are
needed

another
comment
maintained
that
such
names
mislead
consumers
because
they
provide
no

and
that

do
not
contain
levels
of
nutrients
that
are
appropriate
for
the
special
population
named
in
the
claim
.
the
comment
suggested
that
fda
should
,
at
the
very
least
,
require
labels
to
provide
an
explanation
for
these
claims
.
for
example
,
an
explanation
for
a
product
with
a
brand
name
implying
that
it
is
useful
for
women
might
state
that
`
this
product
is
especially
suited
for
young
women
because
it
contains
100
percent
of
the
rdi
for
folic
acid
and
iron
and
30
percent
of
the
rdi
for
calcium
'
fda
agrees
that
products
marketed
for
special
population
groups
may
include
claims
or
brand
names
that
can
be
misleading
.
these
claims
and
brand
names
seem
to
imply
a
particular
benefit
for
certain
subgroups
of
the
population
and
often
do
not
disclose
how
or
why
they
meet
the
needs
of
that
particular
subgroup
.
disclosure
of
such
facts
would
help
to
protect
a
product
from
being
misbranded
under
section
403a
)
of
the
act
because
its
labeling
would
reveal
material
facts
about
the
products
claimed
special
usefulness
.
however
,
such
claims
about
the
usefulness
of
a
product
for
particular
population
groups
generally
fall
under
section
403j
)
of
the
act
to
the
extent
that
they
represent
the
product
to
be
for
special
dietary
use
.
as
special

use
claims
,
they
are
outside

scope
of
this
rulemaking

among
other
things
,
§

the

several
comments
suggested
that
fda
define
the
term
`
natural
'
for
dietary
supplements
because
that
term
is
widely
used
in
the
labeling
of
dietary
supplements
even
though
there
is
no
established
definition
of
that
term
,
and
it
is
misleading
as
it
is
now
used
.
for
example
,
one
comment
stated
that
studies
indicate
that
natural
vitamin
e
(
d
-
alpha
tocopherol
)
is
better
utilized
than
synthetic
vitamin
e
(
dl
-
alpha
and
other
tocopherols
,
but
that
`
natural
'
claims
now
appear
on
products
containing
synthetic
vitamin
e
,
misleading
consumers
who
think
they
are
getting
a
better
utilized
product
.
the
comment
stated
that
in
other
instances
,
companies
use
the
term
`
natural
'
to
mean
that
the
product
contains
no
artificial
ingredients
.
one
comment
acknowledged
that
fda
has
struggled
with
how
to
define
this
term
for
foods
in
conventional
food
form
.
this
comment
suggested
that
the
agency
need
not
resolve
the
dilemma
at
this
time
,
but
that
it
should
simply
establish
a
supplementspecific
supplement
specific
definition
,
just
as
fda
has
established
a
special
definition
for
`
natural
flavor
'
in
§
101
22
.
another
comment
suggested
that
fda
should
allow
`
natural
'
claims
on
products
containing
only
the
naturally
occurring
form
of
a
vitamin
.
the
comment
suggested
that
fda
could
request
comments
about
whether
to
limit
`
natural
'
claims
to
nutrients
,
such
as
vitamin
e
,
that
appear
to
offer
some
advantage
when
consumed
in
a
natural
form
.
the
comment
also
stated
that
many
consumers
will
want
the
option
of
purchasing
other
nutrients
in
the
natural
form
as
well
.
fda
is
not
persuaded
by
the
comments
that
the
term
`
natural
'
should
be
defined
at
this
time
.
as
one
comment
acknowledged
,
the
agency
has
recently
expended
its
resources
exploring
the
use
of
this
term
,
and
it
was
unable
to
arrive
at
an
acceptable
definition
(
58
fr
2302
at
2407
.
fda
currently
lacks
sufficient
resources
to
thoroughly
explore
and
develop
proposed
regulations
for
the
use
of
this
term
on
dietary
supplements
.
in
the
final
rule
on
nutrient
content
claims
,
the
agency
determined
that
it
would
maintain
its
current
policy
(
as
discussed
in
the
general
principles
proposal
(
56
fr
60421
at
60466
)
of
interpreting
this
term
to
mean
that
nothing
artificial
or
synthetic
(
including
all
color
additives
regardless
of
source
)
has
been
included
in
,
or
has
been
added
to
,
a
food
(
ref
.
7
.
fda
also
decided
that
it
would
continue
to
distinguish
between
natural
and
artificial
flavors
as
outlined
in
§
101
22
.
the
agency
concludes
that
,
for
the
reasons
cited
above
,
it
is
appropriate
to
apply
this
policy
to
dietary
supplements
.
in
this
regard
,
fda
also
points
out
that
§
1019k6
)
states
that
a
food
labeled
under
the
provisions
of
this
section
shall
be
deemed
to
be
misbranded
under
sections
201n
)
and
403a
)
of
the
act
if
its
label
or
labeling
represents
,
suggests
,
or
implies
,
`
that
a
natural
vitamin
in
a
food
is
superior
to
an
added
or
synthetic
vitamin
or
to
differentiate
in
any
way
between
vitamins
naturally
present
from
those
added
'
v
.
other
provisions
fda
did
not
receive
any
comments
that
dealt
specifically
with
the
other
provisions
of
the
proposal
.
in
the
absence
of
any
basis
for
doing
otherwise
,
fda
is
adopting
those
provisions
as
proposed
.
vi
.
economic
impact
in
its
dietary
supplement
labeling
proposals
of
06/18/1993
,
fda
stated
that
the
proposed
rules
on
the
labeling
of
dietary
supplements
,
taken
as
a
whole
,
would
have
associated
costs
of
approximately
$
20
million
.
thus
,
the
agency
concluded
that
the
proposed
rules
would
not
constitute
a
major
rule
as
defined
by
executive
order
12291
.
in
accordance
with
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
(
pub
.
l
.
96354
,
fda
explored
whether
the
proposed
rules
may
have
a
significant
impact
on
small
businesses
and
tentatively
concluded
that
they
do
not
.
fda
has
evaluated
the
many
comments
that
it
received
in
response
to
its
economic
impact
analysis
.
because
the
issues
raised
in
the
comments
relate
to
all
three
proposals
,
fda
has
combined
its
discussion
of
these
comments
and
presented
them
in
the
final
rule
regarding
the
date
of
application
published
elsewhere
in
this
issue
of
the
federal
register
fda
has
examined
the
economic
implications
of
the
final
rules
amending
21
cfr
as
required
by
executive
order
12866
and
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
.
executive
order
12866
directs
agencies
to
assess
all
costs
and
benefits
of
available
regulatory
alternatives
and
,
when
regulation
is
necessary
,
to
select
regulatory
approaches
that
maximize
net
benefits
(
including
potential
economic
,
environmental
,
public
health
and
safety
effects
;
distributive
impacts
;
and
equity
.
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
requires
the
agency
to
analyze
options
for
regulatory
relief
for
small
businesses
.
fda
has
concluded
,
based
on
its
review
of
the
available
data
and
comments
,
that
these
final
rules
are
not
significant
as
defined
by
executive
order
12866
.
further
,
in
accordance
with
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
,
the
agency
certifies
that
these
final
rules
will
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
businesses
.
vii
.
environmental
impact
the
agency
has
determined
under
21
cfr

)
that
this
action
is
of
a
type
that
does
not
individually
or
cumulatively
have
a
significant
effect
on
the
human
environment
.
therefore
,
neither
an
environmental
assessment
nor
an
environmental

statement
is
