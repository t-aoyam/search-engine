a
`

of
10
%

performed
.
in
all
cases
,
differences
will
be
observed
between
the
first
and
second
counts
of
the
same
filter
wedge
.
most
of
these
differences
will
be
due
to
chance
alone
,
that
is
,
due
to
the
random
variability
(
precision
)
of
the
count
method
.
statistical
recount
criteria
enables
one
to
decide
whether
observed
differences
can
be
explained
due
to
chance
alone
or
are
probably
due
to
systematic
differences
between
analysts
,
microscopes
,
or
other
biasing
factors
.
the
following
recount
criterion
is
for
a

the
criterion
is
given
at

that
is
,
there
is
5
%
maximum
risk
that
we
will
reject
a
pair
of
counts
for
the
reason
that
one
might
be
biased
,
when
the
large
observed
difference
is
really
due
to
chance
.

quality
control
the
osha
asbestos
regulations
require
each
laboratory
to
establish
a
quality
control
program
.
the
following
is
presented
as
an
example
of
how
the
oshasltc
osha
sltc
constructed
its
internal
cv
curve
as
part
of
meeting
this
requirement
.
data
for
the
cv
curve
shown
below
is
from
395
samples
collected
during
osha
compliance
inspections
and
analyzed
from
october
1980
through
04/19/1986
.
each
sample
was
counted
by
2
to
5
different
counters
independently
of
one
another
.
the
standard
deviation
and
the
cv
statistic
was
calculated
for
each
sample
.
this
data
was
then
plotted
on
a
graph
of
cv
vs
.
fibers
mm2
.
a
least
squares
regression
was
performed
using
the
following
