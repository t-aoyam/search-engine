any

in

the
epa
examined
special
compliance
provisions

facilities

affected
sources
that
are
applying
coatings
using
continuous
coaters
have
two
options
for
demonstrating
compliance
.
these
are
:
1
.
using
compliant
coatings
,
as
determined
by
the
vhap
content
of
the
coating
in
the
reservoir
and
the
vhap
content
of
the
coating
as
calculated
from
records
;
or
2
.
using
compliant
coatings
,
as
determined
by
the
vhap
content
of
the
coating
in
the
reservoir
,
and
maintaining
a
viscosity
of
the
coating
in
the
reservoir
that
is
no
less
than
the
viscosity
of
the
initial
coating
.
the
agency
recognizes
that
records
may
show
the
vhap
content
of
a
coating
is
higher
than
the
emission
limitation
when
the
coating
is
applied
with
a
continuous
coater
.
however
,
the
agency
also
recognizes
that
continuous
coaters
are
potentially
more
efficient
than
spray
application
systems
.
in
order
to
use
option
(
2
,
the
affected
source
must
demonstrate
that
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
viscosity
of
the
material
and
the
hap
content
of
the
material
.
affected
sources
may
monitor
the
viscosity
of
the
coating
with
a
viscosity
meter
or
they
may
measure
the
viscosity
each
time
solvent
is
added
to
the
reservoir
.
if
an
affected
source
does
not
wish
to
monitor
the
viscosity
then
records
must
demonstrate
that
the
coating
is
compliant
