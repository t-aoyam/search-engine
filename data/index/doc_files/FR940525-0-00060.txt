all

removed
from

each

was
almost
universally
rejected
by
commenters
who
attended
public
meetings
and
by
those
who
submitted
written
comments

the
council
and
nmfs
are
aware
that
initiatives
are
underway
which
involve
acoustical
alarm
research
and
possible
modifications
to
gillnet
gear
to
reduce
porpoise
bycatch
.
if
any
of
these
approaches
produce
scientifically
supportable
results
that
can
be
incorporated
into
a
management
strategy
,
the
council
would
recommend
them
through
a
framework
adjustment
with
a
minimum
of
regulatory
delay
.
comment
:
several
commenters
questioned
why
the
council
rejected
the
use
of
an
industry
proposal
based
on
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
gillnets
in
use
.
response
:
at
this
time
,
it
is
not
possible
to
determine
the
relationship
between
the
number
of
nets
and
fishing
or
harbor
porpoise
mortality
.
it
is
known
only
that
there
is
a
relationship
that
is
not
linear
.
even
a
simple
estimation
of
the
number
of
nets
in
use
is
impossible
,
at
present
,
because
of
the
variability
of
length
of
nets
,
numbers
of
nets
in
a
string
,
soak
time
and
the
variable
numbers
of
both
full
-
and
parttime
part
time
vessels
participating
in
the
fishery
.
moreover
,
enforcement
of
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
nets
in
the
ocean
,
as
opposed
to
a
time
and
area
prohibition
,
would
be
very
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
accomplish
at
this
time
.
classification
this
regulation
is
not
subject
to
the
requirements
to
prepare
a
proposed
rule
under
the
conditions
met
by
this
framework
action
that
have
provided
adequate
prior
public
comment
when
the
action
was
proposed
and
discussed
over
the
course
of
several
council
meetings
.
therefore
,
a
regulatory
flexibility
analysis
was
not
prepared
for
this
action
because
it
is
exempt
from
such
an
analysis
under
the
regulatory

this
final
rule
has
been
determined
to
be
not
significant
