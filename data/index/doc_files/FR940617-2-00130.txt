comment
:
two
commenters
had
concerns
regarding
orrs
encouragement
to
states
and
counties
to
give
special
consideration
to
coalitions
of
refugee
service
organizations
.
one
commenter
expressed
concern
about
how
coalitions
would
be
more
costeffective
cost
effective
.
the
commenter
also
questioned
how
orr
envisions
special
consideration
for
coalitions
in
relation
to
the
competitive
procurement
process
.
another
commenter
felt
that
coordination
should
not
be
mandated
as
an
end
in
itself
.
the
commenter
felt
that
if
early
employment
is
the
goal
,
local
service
systems
should
be
as
uncomplicated
as
possible
in
order
to
get
the
job
done
efficiently
.
the
commenter
was
concerned
that
current
providers
that
are
doing
an
effective
job
would
be
dismantled
prematurely
.
response
:
we
believe
that
the
formation
of
coalitions
among
refugee
service
agencies
ought
to
lead
to
service
delivery
efficiencies
and
to
a
rational
downsizing
of
existing
systems
that
will
be
necessary
to
keep
pace
with
the
changing
nature
of
the
refugee
population
to
be
served
.
we
believe
the
formation
of
coalitions
will
enable
the
pooling
of
varied
talents
and
skills
within
the
agencies
to
more
efficiently
serve
the
changing
population
of
refugee
arrivals
that
will
occur
over
the
next
few
years
.
we
also
believe
that
the
formation
of
coalitions
should
result
in
the
reduction
of
administrative
costs
such
as
accounting
and
reporting
costs
,
making
coalitions
more
competitive
.
in
addition
,
we
believe
the
formation
of
coalitions
will
result
in
better
coordination
of
services
to
refugees
.
encouragement
of
or
special
consideration
for
coalitions
should
not
interfere
with
state
procurement
requirements
.
coalitions
will
have
to
compete
along
with
other
applicants
.
however
,
states
in
their
requests
for
proposals
(
rfps
)
could
choose
to
include
language
that
encourages
the
formation
of
coalitions
or
could
include
bonus
points
for
coalitions
in
the
scoring
criteria
,
as
long
as
these
actions
do
not
violate
state
procurement
rules
.
comment
:
one
commenter
requested
clarification
on
whether
language
in
the
notice
such
as
`
states
are
strongly
encouraged
'
and
`
the
state
should
'
is
advisory
or
is
a
mandatory
requirement
.
response
:
when
orr
uses
phrases
such
as
`
states
are
strongly
encouraged
'
`
states
are
expected
to
'
or
`
the
state
should
'
the
language
is
advisory
in
nature
and
should
not
be
interpreted
as
a
mandatory
requirement
.
comment
:
six
commenters
made
comments
regarding
requirements
for
the
use
of
discretionary
funds
for
services
to
former
political
prisoners
(
fpp
)
from
vietnam
.
one
commenter
requested
that
orr
specify
which
family
members
are
eligible
for
services
under
the
fpp
setaside
set
aside
or
allow
states
and
counties
to
make
that
determination
.
the
commenter
also
requested
that
orr
define
what
adjustment
services
may
be
provided
under
the
fpp
program
and
recommended
that
orr
use
the
same
definition
as
used
in
45
cfr
400
155
)
of
the
orr
regulations
.
one
commenter
,
noting
orrs
prohibition
against
the
purchase
of
advertising
space
and
air
time
with
fpp
funds
,
recommended
that
paid
outreach
announcements
through
refugee
community
media
and
vietnamese
newspapers
be
allowed
under
the
fpp
program
.
one
commenter
noted
that
orr
requires
states
to
allocate
fpp
funds
using
a
formula
that
reflects
recent
and
anticipated
arrivals
of
former
political
prisoners
.
the
commenter
pointed
out
that
there
is
no
timely
or
reliable
source
of
anticipated
arrivals
by
state
and
recommended
limiting
the
state
allocation
formula
to
recent
arrivals
and
recommended
defining
the
term
`
recent
arrivals
'
one
commenter
recommended
that
counties
which
administer
fpp
programs
be
granted
10
%
for
administrative
costs
and
that
states
should
be
limited
to
no
more
than
2
%
for
administrative
costs
.
two
commenters
recommended
dropping
outcomes
as
a
performance
reporting
requirement
under
the
fpp
program
.
one
of
the
commenters
questioned
the
increased
reporting
requirements
when
the
fpp
program
is
entering
its
last
year
of
operation
.
another
commenter
recommended
accepting
available
individual
contract
data
on
outcomes
since
it
would
be
difficult
in
some
states
with
a
wide
range
of
fpp
services
to
provide
a
programwide
program
wide
outcomes
report
.
one
commenter
supported
the
proposed
fpp
reporting
requirements
and
did
not
feel
the
increased
reporting
requirements
would
add
significantly
to
existing
workloads
.
another
commenter
recommended
that
fpp
projects
be
supported
that
demonstrate
accountability
for
outcomes
such
as
those
that
occurred
in
the
amerasian
projects
.
the
commenter
further
suggested
that
orr
should
require
coordination
between
the
agencies
that
provide
fpp
services
and
the
voluntary
agencies
that
resettle
former
political
prisoners
.
response
:
family
members
who
are
eligible
for
services
under
the
fpp
setaside
set
aside
include
any
relative
of
a
former
political
prisoner
who
lives
in
the
same
household
with
the
fpp
.
adjustment
services
are
defined
as
those
services
listed
under
45
cfr
400
155
)
of
the
orr
regulations
.
this
definition
is
included
in
this
notice
.
regarding
the
use
of
fpp
funds
for
paid
outreach
announcements
through
the
refugee
media
,
our
position
is
unchanged
on
this
issue
;
we
do
not
feel
that
the
purchase
of
advertising
space
and
air
time
constitutes
an
effective
use
of
fpp
funds
.
fpp
providers
should
work
with
the
voluntary
agencies
that
resettled
fpp
refugees
to
contact
these
refugees
within
the
constraints
of
the
privacy
act
.
