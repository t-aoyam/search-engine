standard
preparation
a
way
to
prepare
standard
asbestos
samples
of
known
concentration
has
not
been
developed
.
it
is
possible
to
prepare
replicate
samples
of
nearly
equal
concentration
.
this
has
been
performed
through
the
pat
program
.
these
asbestos
samples
are
distributed
by
the
aiha
to
participating
laboratories
.
since
only
about
onefourth
one
fourth
of
a
25mm
sample
membrane
is
required
for
an
asbestos
count
,
any
pat
sample
can
serve
as
a
`
standard
'
for
replicate
counting

sample
mounting
note
:
see
safety
precautions
in
section
61
.
before
proceeding
.
the
objective
is
to
produce
samples
with
a
smooth
(
nongrainy
grainy
)
background
in
a
medium
with
a
refractive
index
of
approximately
1
46
.
the
technique
below
collapses
the
filter
for
easier
focusing
and
produces
permanent
mounts
which
are
useful
for
quality
control
and
interlaboratory
comparison
.
an
aluminum
block
or
similar
device
is
required
for
sample
preparation
.
a
drawing
is
shown
in
figure

.
651
.
heat
the
aluminum
block
to
about
70
&
cir
;
c
.
the
hot
block
should
not
be
used
on
any
surface
that
can
be
damaged
by
either
the
heat
or
from
exposure
to
acetone
.
652
.
ensure
that
the
glass
slides
and
cover
glasses
are
free
of
dust
and
fibers
.
653
.
remove
the
top
plug
to
prevent
a
vacuum
when
the
cassette
is
opened
.
clean
the
outside
of
the
cassette
if
necessary
.
cut
the
seal
and
or
tape
on
the
cassette
with
a
razor
blade
.
very
carefully
separate
the
base
from
the
extension
cowl
,
leaving
the
filter
and
backup
pad
in
the
base
.
654
.
with
a
rocking
motion
cut
a
triangular
wedge
from
the
filter
using
the
scalpel
.
this
wedge
should
be
onesixth
one
sixth
to
onefourth
one
fourth
of
the
filter
.
grasp
the
filter
wedge
with
the
forceps
on
the
perimeter
of
the
filter
which
was
clamped
between
the
cassette
pieces
.
do
not
touch
the
filter
with
your
finger
.
place
the
filter
on
the
glass
slide
sample
side
up
.
static
electricity
will
usually
keep
the
filter
on
the
slide
until
it
is
cleared
.
655
.
place
the
tip
of
the
micropipette
containing
about
200
l
acetone
into
the
aluminum
block
.
insert
the
glass
slide
into
the
receiving
slot
in
the
aluminum
block
.
inject
the
acetone
into
the
block
with
slow
,
steady
pressure
on
the
plunger
while
holding
the
pipette
firmly
in
place
.
wait
3
to
5
seconds
for
the
filter
to
clear
,
then
remove
the
pipette
and
slide
from
the
aluminum
block
.
656
.
immediately
(
less
than
30
seconds
)
place
25
to
35
l
of
triacetin
on
the
filter
(
note
:
waiting
longer
than
30
seconds
will
result
in
increased
index
of
refraction
and
decreased
contrast
between
the
fibers
and
the
preparation
.
this
may
also
lead
to
separation
of
the
cover

from
the
slide
.
657
.
lower
a
cover
slip
gently
onto
the
filter
at
a
slight
angle
to
reduce
the
possibility
of
forming
air
bubbles
.
if
more
than
30
seconds
have
elapsed
between
acetone
exposure
and
triacetin
application
,
glue
the
edges
of
the
cover
slip
to
the
