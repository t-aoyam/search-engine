of
the
effect

fsis
is
requesting
comments
regarding
this
approach
and
possible
conditions
for
exceptions
,
eg
,
when
poultry
and
meat
food
products
are
subject
to
a
regulatory
definition
and
standard
which
establishes
a
minimum
requirement
for
protein
content
and
a
maximum
limit
on
fat
content
which
ensure
finished

fsis
also
recognizes

be
used
at
very
low
levels
(

fsis
is
particularly
interested

receiving
comments
on
whether
such

should
be
permitted
for
this
purpose
and
,
if
so
,
in
what
products
and
under
what
conditions
.
for
example
,
would
it
be
adequate
and
appropriate
to
permit
this
type
of

long
as
it
is

tentative
position
:
labeling
.
fsis
expects
to
include
special
provisions
for
the
labels
of
mdp
and
products
in
which
it
is
used
as
an
ingredient
.
if
adopted
,
these
provisions
would
supplement

,
more
general
requirements

(

tentative
position
:
the
product
.
fsis
is
considering
the
following
possible
labeling
provisions
for
mdp
:
(
a
)
the
name
of
the
product
(
eg
,
`
mechanically
separated
(
kind
'
must
be
followed
immediately
by
the
phrases
)
`
for
processing
'
unless
it
has
a
protein
content
of
not
less
than
14
percent
and
a
fat
content
of
not
more
than
25
percent
,
`
made
from
fowl
'
unless
it
is
not
made
,
in
whole
or
part
,
from
mature
female
chickens
(
see
9
cfr
381
170
,
and
`
with
excess
skin
'
unless
it
is
made
from
poultry
product
that
does
not
include
skin
in
excess
of
the
natural
proportion
present
on
the
whole
carcass
(
see
9
cfr
381
117
;
(
b
)
after
any
such
required
information
,
the
name
of
the
product
may
be
followed
by
`
without
skin
'
and
or
`
without
kidneys
and
sex
glands
'
if
it
is
made
from
poultry
product
that
does
not
include
skin
and
or
that
does
not
include
kidneys
or
sex
glands
;
and
(
c
)
there
must
be
appropriate
descriptive
terminology
if
heat
treatment
has
been
used
in
the
preparation
of
such
product
.
because
the
characteristics
specified
are
ones
which
would
affect
use
of
mdp
,
fsis
is
considering
that
,
in
order
to
assure
compliance
with
regulatory
requirements
and
thereby
prevent
the
adulteration
and
misbranding
of
finished
poultry
products
and
meat
food
products
,
it
is
necessary
to
provide
for
their
clear
identification
on
the
label
when
mdp
leaves
the
establishment
at
which
it
is
manufactured
(
see
9
cfr
381
115
.
as
indicated
previously
,
the
regulations
already
require
that
information
bearing
on
useincluding
deviations
from
the
natural
whole
carcass
proportion
of
skin
as
well
as
the
fact
of
cookingappear
on
the
label
of
mechanically
separated
poultry
product
(
9
cfr
381
117
.
the
presence
of
skin
or
its
presence
in
excess
of
the
natural
whole
carcass
proportion
would
,
as
discussed
previously
,
continue
to
affect
product
use
if
the
regulations
are
amended
.
the
use
of
heat
treatment
in
the
preparation
of
the
product
also
would
be
of
continuing
relevance
(
9
cfr
381
157
.
in
addition
,
since
the
presence
of
poultry
kidneys
or
sex
glands
can
affect
use
(
9
cfr
319
180
,
a
number
of
manufacturers
of
mdp
not
containing
these
parts
currently
choose
to
note
this
fact
on
the
label
.
the
other
information
that
would
be
required
is
identification
of
product
made
from
fowl
and
product
for
processing
.
