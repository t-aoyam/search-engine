various
participants
asked
osha
to
require
an
employer
to
adopt
and
operations
and
management
(
oampm
)
program
to
protect
custodial
and
maintenance
workers
.
the
agency
notes
that
the
1986
standard
contained
,
in
nonmandatory
mandatory
appendix
g
,
such
a
program
,
which
listed
precautionary
actions
which
the
agency
recommended
.
osha
has
not
adopted
an
explicit
oampm
program
requirement
in
these
standards
.
rather
,
the
agency
has
adopted
enforceable
provisions
which
cover
the
major
elements
of
the
previous
nonmandatory
mandatory
program
in
the
appendix
,
and
of
various
programs
suggested
by
participants
in
this
rulemaking
.
for
example
,
the
new
requirement
that
maintenance
and
custodial
work
be
the
subject
of
exposure
assessments
,
[
see
paragraph
(
f2
,
requires
the
competent
person
to
evaluate
operations
which
may
expose
employees
to
asbestos
,
in
order
to
minimize
exposure
.
the
requirement
is
`
operation
'
based
;
rather
than
,
as
in
an
oampm
program
,
statusbased
status
based
.
however
,
any
active
disturbance
constitutes
an
operation
.
although
each
`
operation
'
must
be
covered
by
an
exposure
assessment
,
operations
can
be
grouped
.
cleaning
up
debris
in
an
area
containing
deteriorating
acm
on
a
daily
basis
,
need
not
be
evaluated
each
day
.
an
assessment
of
such
activity
can
be
made
on
a
general
basis
,
covering
procedures
for
wet
sweeping
and
vacuuming
,
disposal
,
and
instructions
to
detect
deterioration
of
material
which
contributes
to
the
debris
.
additionally
,
labelling
of
acm
and
pacm
usually
considered
part
of
an
oampm
program
,
is
separately
required
,
as
is
training
of
custodial
workers
.
specific
jobs
may
require
specific
instructions
;
the
breadth
of
some
are
indicated
by
oampm
documents
generated
by
the
epa
`
green
book
'
(
ex
.

,
epa

,

and
nibs

.
osha
believes
that
competent
person
supervision
of
activities
under
this
standard
will
provide
appropriate
work
practices
to
be
followed
for
relatively
small
,
less
hazardous
exposure
situations
.
the
agency
is
requiring
however
,
in
the
training
provisions
,
that
when
class
iii
and
iv
workers
are
trained
,
that
the
contents
of
the
epa
or
state
approved
courses
for
such
workers
,
as
the
relate
to
the
work
to
be
performed
,
be
part
of
the
required
training
material
[
paragraph
(
kvd
.
the
issue
of
passive
exposure
,
that
is
where
active
contact
or
disturbance
of
acm
is
not
a
contributing
factor
to
asbestos
fiber
release
,
is
covered
by
the
various
notification
and
identification
provisions
in
the
standard
which
will
allow
employees
to
identify
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
material
.
these
are
discussed
later
in
this
preamble
.
in
oshas
expert
view
,
these
provisions
constitute
major
components
of
operations
and
maintenance
programs
recommended
;
are
aimed
at
the
more
significant
sources
of
exposure
for
custodial
workers
,
and
most
importantly
,
are
enforceable
.
for
all
these
reasons
,
osha
believes
an
explicit
requirement
for
an
oampm
program
,
such
as
suggested
by
afscme
(
ex
.

at

,
would
add
little
benefit
to
employee
health
(
see
eg
,
tr
3500
.
in
each
standard
,
osha
is
requiring
specific
work
practices
and
a
choice
of
engineeromg
cpmtrp
;
however
,
osha
is
aware
that
some
asbestos
control
systems
may
be
patented
.
osha
has
not
considered
the
existence
of
patents
or
their
validity
in
evaluating
the
need
for
those
controls
.
osha
believes
that
all
employers
will
have
a
variety
of
controls
available
to
them
and
that
new
types
could
be
developed
.
