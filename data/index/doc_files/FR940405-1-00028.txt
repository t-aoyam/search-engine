the
proposal
to
phase
out
use
of
gamay
beaujolais
proved
controversial
.
only
three
respondents
concurred
with
atfs
proposal
to
phase
out
use
of
gamay
beaujolais
noting
that
it
is
not
the
name
of
any
grape
variety
.
twentyseven
twenty
seven
other
respondents
objected
to
the
proposal
.
the
consensus
among
these
respondents
was
that
gamay
beaujolais
is
well
known
to
consumers
as
a
light
red
,
young
,
fruity
wine
and
that
consumers
do
not
view
it
as
a
varietal
wine
.
several
consumers
commented
that
consumer
recognition
of
gamay
beaujolais
is
good
;
that
the
wine
is
popular
;
that
consumers
know
what
they
are
buying
;
and
that
elimination
of
the
designation
would
serve
no
consumer
purpose
.
winery
proprietors
cited
the
large
market
for
this
wine
and
argued
that
elimination
of
the
designation
would
have
a
severe
economic
impact
on
their
business
and
also
on
grape
growers
.

because

varied
widely
in

approach

,
and
because
a
lengthy
period
of
time
had
passed
since
the
issuance
of

.
581
,
atf
decided
to
open
the
issue
of
grape

names
to
additional
public
comment
.
thus
,
on

atf

atf

issue
will
be
in
a
forthcoming

proposal
the
evidence
considered
by
atf
established
that
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
is
not
a
true
varietal
name
,
and
that
the
two
grape
varieties
which
have
been
called
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
in
this
country
are
not
gamay
grapes
.
therefore
,
atf
has
concluded
that
gamay
beaujolais
should
not
be
listed
in
subpart
j
of
27
cfr
part
4
as
a
grape
variety
name
.
on
the
basis
of
the
comments

.
581
and
749
and
current
trade
and
consumer
recognition
of
the
name
,
atf
instead
believes
that
gamay
beaujolais
is
generally
known
as
a
type
of
red
wine
which
may
be
described
as
light
and
fruity
.
however
,
atf
believes
that
many
consumers
associate
the
designation
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
with
a
wine
produced
from
the
pinot
noir
or
napa
gamay
grape
varieties
.
therefore
,
instead
of
phasing
out
the
use
of
the
designation
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
as
proposed
by
notice
no
.
581
,
atf
is
proposing
to
specifically
allow
the
continued
use
of
gamay
beaujolais
under
section
4
34
.
since
only
wines
produced
from
the
pinot
noir
or
napa
gamay
grape
varieties
have
been
labeled
as
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
atf
believes
that
consumers
now
associate
those
two
varieties
with
the
designation
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
however
,
atf
believes
that
as
part
of
its
effort
to
standardize
the
use
of
american
varietal
names
,
it
should
no
longer
allow
the
unqualified
use
of
the
designation
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
to
refer
to
two
separate
grape
varieties
,
neither
of
which
is
a
true
gamay
grape
.
as
previously
discussed
,
existing
regulations
provide
that
a
wine
is
not
entitled
to
a
varietal
type
designation
unless
75
percent
of
its
volume
is
derived
from
grapes
of
that
variety
.
accordingly
,
atf
is
proposing
to
allow
the
use
of
the
designation
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
only
where
the
wine
derives
not
less
than
75
percent
of
its
volume
from
pinot
noir
grapes
or
napa
gamay
grapes
.
wine
which
is
labeled
with
the
designation
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
must
also
state
on
the
label
a
varietal
type
designation
(
pinot
noir
or
napa
gamay
)
and
an
appellation
of
origin
.
furthermore
,
the
proposed
amendment
to
section
4
34
specifies
that
the
optional
designation
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
must
appear
in
direct
conjunction
with
the
varietal
type
designation
and
the
appellation
of
origin
,
and
shall
appear
in
lettering
of
substantially
the
same
size
and
kind
.
atf
believes
that
the
proposed
amendment
strikes
a
balance
between
the
views
of
the
opposing
commenters
on
this
issue
.
on
the
one
hand
,
various
consumers
and
winery
proprietors
have
commented
that
consumer
recognition
of
the
designation
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
is
good
,
and
that
winery
proprietors
should
not
be
forced
to
abandon
its
use
.
on
the
other
hand
,
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
is
not
an
accurate
varietal
designation
,
and
the
purpose
of
the
varietal
grape
regulations
is
to
ensure
that
the
consumer
is
not
misled
as
to
the
actual
grape
varieties
used
in
the
production
of
wine
.
atf
believes
that
allowing
the
use
of
the
optional
designation
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
in
direct
conjunction
with
the
actual
varietal
type
designation
(
pinot
noir
or
napa
gamay
,
as
well
as
an
appellation
of
origin
reflecting
the
true
origin
of
the
grapes
,
will
not
be
confusing
or
misleading
to
consumers
.
the
proposed
amendment
will
authorize
labels
which
clearly
inform
the
consumer
about
the
actual
grape
variety
used
to
make
the
wine
,
and
the
origin
of
the
grapes
,
while
still
allowing
winery
proprietors
to
use
a
label
designation
which
has
gained
widespread
consumer
recognition
in
this
country
.
public
participation
atf
requests
comments
from
all
interested
persons
concerning
the
proposed
wine
designation
.
comments
received
on
or
before
the
closing
date
will
be
carefully
considered
.
comments
received
after
that
date
will
be
given
the
same
consideration
if
it
is
practical
to
do
so
,
but
assurance
of
consideration
cannot
be
given
except
as
to
comments

atf
will
not
recognize
any

in

as
confidential
.

be
disclosed
to
the
public
.
any
material
which
a
respondent
considers
to
be
confidential
or
inappropriate
for

to

should
not
be
included
in
the

the
name
of
any

submitting
a

not
exempt
from
disclosure

any
interested
person
who
desires
an
opportunity
to
comment
orally
at
a
public
hearing
on
the
proposed
regulation
should
submit
his
or
her
request
,
in
writing
,
to
the
director
within
the

.
the

whether
