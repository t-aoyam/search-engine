analysis
the

the

to
all
industries
of
complying
with
the
proposed
standard
.
this
chapter
examines
projected
economic
and
environmental
impacts
on
those
industries
.
osha
developed
quantitative
estimates
of
the
economic
impact
of
the
proposed
standard
on
the
affected

the

of
affected
industries
and

not
necessarily
represent
their
ability
to
pay
for
proposed
standard
provisions
.
osha
assessed
the
potential
economic
impacts
and
has
preliminarily
determined
that
the
standard
is
economically
feasible
for
each
of
the
major
industry
groups
that
will
be
affected
.
osha
conducted
its
analysis
at
the
two
digit
sic
level
.
this
has
been
oshas
procedure
for
doing
regulatory
impact
analyses
for
other
proposed
standards
.
osha
preliminarily
concludes
that
this
is
reflective
of
the
actual
impact
on
the
average
firm
within
each
subsector
.
it
does
not
appear
that
the
affected
groups
will
experience
significant
adverse
economic
impact
as
a
result
of
the
standard
.
however
,
if
any
interested
person
has
information
to
show
that
the
analysis
at
the
two
digit
level
is
not
representative
of
the
potential
economic
impact
of
the
proposal
,
osha
requests
the
following
information
:
reasons
why
the
preliminary
regulatory
analysis
is
not
reflective
of
the
actual
anticipated
costs
in
any
particular
sector
;
specific
information
as
to
why
the
analysis
at
the
two
digit
level
fails
to
adequately
represent
the
economic
impact
;
and
specific
information
to
help
osha
to
better
predict
the
impact
on
the
sector
in
question
.
such
information
should
be
included
in
the
comments
on
the
proposal

in
accordance
with
the
regulatory

act
of
1980
,
osha
additionally
examined
the
potential
for
an
unduly
burdensome
impact
on
small
entities
.
osha
believes
that
the
standard
will
not
have
significant
adverse
effect
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
.
however
,
osha
requests
comment
on
those
workplaces
for
which
compliance
with
the
proposed
standard
would
prove
economically
and
technologically
