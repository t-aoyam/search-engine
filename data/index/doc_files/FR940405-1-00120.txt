with
respect
to
tobacco
smoke
in
workplaces
where
smoking
is
not
prohibited
,
paragraph
(
e1
)
proposes
to
require
the
establishment
of
designated
smoking
areas
.
such
areas
must
be
enclosed
and
exhausted
directly
to
the
outside
,
and
maintained
under
negative
pressure
sufficient
to
contain
tobacco
smoke
within
the
designated
area
.
smoking
is
not
permitted
during
cleaning
and
maintenance
work
in
these
designated
smoking
areas
.
moreover
,
although
cleaning
and
maintenance
are
specified
in
this
paragraph
,
it
is
oshas
intent
that
no
work
of
any
kind
shall
be
performed
in
a
designated
smoking
area
when
smoking
is
taking
place
.
designated
smoking
areas
must
be
areas
where
employees
do
not
have
to
enter
in
the
performance
of
normal
work
activities
.
signs
must
also
be
posted
at
designated
smoking
areas
.
signs
must
be
posted
to
inform
anyone
entering
the
building
that
smoking
is
restricted
to
designated
areas
.
finally
,
smoking
within
designated
areas
is
not
permitted
during
any
time
that
the
exhaust
ventilation
system
servicing
that
area
is
not
operating
properly
.
the
proposed
provisions
under
paragraph
(
e1
)
addressing
control
of
tobacco
smoke
are
intended
to
ensure
that
employees
outside
of
the
designated
smoking
area
will
not
be
exposed
to
ets
.
the
agency
anticipates
that
the
provisions
as
proposed
will
accomplish
that
goal
.
enclosing
smoking
areas
,
exhausting
them
to
the
outside
,
maintaining
them
under
negative
pressure
,
and
prohibiting
smoking
in
designated
areas
even
when
the
exhaust
system
is
inoperable
are
believed
to
be
necessary
and
sufficient
to
prevent
tobacco
smoke
from
migrating
to
other
areas
of
the
building
.
the
designated
smoking
area
must
be
under
negative
pressure
compared
to
all
surrounding
spaces
including
adjoining
rooms
,
corridors
,
plenums
and
chases
.
negative
pressure
is
achieved
by
exhausting
more
air
from
the
space
than
is
supplied
to
the
space
.
