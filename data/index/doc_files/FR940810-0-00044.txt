public
comment
on
options
to
protect
workers
from
inadvertent
exposure
to

in

(

.
this
issue
,
not
part
of
the
courts
remand
order
,
was
broached
by
the
agency
in
the
preamble
to
the
proposal
,
and
had
been
the
subject
of
litigation
brought
by
service
employees
international
union
(

)
against
epa
.
in
1988
the
service
employees
international
union
,
aflcio
afl
cio
petitioned
the
environmental
protection
agency
for
regulation
of
asbestos
in
public
and
commercial
buildings
and
subsequently
sued
the
agency
.
this
resulted
in
the
convening
of
a
series
of
`
policy
dialogue
'
meetings
established
by
epa
in
an
attempt
to
reach
agreement
on
issues
concerning
asbestos
in
public
and
commercial
buildings
.
as
discussed
in
the
nprm
of
07/20/1990
,
osha
and
a
variety
of
other
interested
parties
participated
in
the
meetings
which
took
place
between
05/19/1989
and
05/19/1990
.
these
groups
included
realty
interests
,
lenders
and
insurance
interests
,
unions
,
asbestos
manufacturers
,
public
interest
groups
,
asbestos
consultants
and
contractors
and
states
.
the
group
failed
to
agree
on
all
issues
,
but
did
generally
agree
that
the
presence
of
asbestos
should
be
known
to
building
service
workers
.
the
major
area
of
disagreement
in
the
group
dealt
with
the
characterization
of
risk
to
general
building
occupants
and
office
workers
.
the
group
also
did
not
agree
on
the
need
for
specific
federal
asbestos
inspection
requirements
.
seiu
and
other
unions
also
participated
in
this
rulemaking
and
urged
osha
to
issue
a
building
inspection
rule
.
after
discussions
with
epa
and
review
of
the
record
concerning
how
best
to
protect
employees
against
unknowing
exposure
the
agency
published
a
request
for
comment
on
a
regulatory
approach
to
protect
building
service
workers
.
the
approach
would
require
certain
highrisk
high
risk
materials
in
accessible
building
facility
areas
be
designated
presumptive
asbestos
containing
materials
and
thus
be
treated
as
if
they
contained
asbestos
,
until
or
unless
the
presumption
was
rebutted
through
sampling
or
specific
information
in
the
owners
possession
relation
to
construction
specifications
.
the
notice
also
asked
for
comments
on
the
health

institute
(

)
report
which
had
been
submitted
to
the
record
after
the
close
of
the
posthearing
hearing
briefing
periods
.
the
notice
resulted
in
submission
of
an
additional
60
sets
of
comments
,
and
the
comment
period
closed
on
01/04/1993
.
the
record
of
this
rulemaking
consists
of
over
55000
pages
.

worked
