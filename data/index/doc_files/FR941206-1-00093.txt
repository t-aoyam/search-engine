background
the
proposed
rule
represents
the
epas
first
extensive
regulation
of
air
pollutants
from
the
shipbuilding
and
ship
repair
industry
.
essentially
all
volatile
organic
hazardous
air
pollutants
(
vohap
)
are
a
subset
of
a
category
of
pollutants
referred
to
as
volatile
organic
compounds
(
voc
.
the
voc
is
a
class
of
pollutants
that
are
photochemically
reactive
precursors
of
ozone
.
emissions
of
voc
(
and
consequently
vohap
as
well
)
from
`
marine
coating
operations
'
have
been
regulated
by
some
state
and
local
district
rules
.
california
and
louisiana
have
defined
voc
limits
for
a
wide
range
of
marine
coating
categories
.
the
california
limits
being
generally
more
stringent
than
those
of
louisiana
.
other
states
have
limited
voc
emissions
from
the
industrys
spray
booths
as
one
of
many
`
miscellaneous

operations
