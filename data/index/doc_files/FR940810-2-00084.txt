.
however
,
the
service
,
under
limited
circumstances
,
may
issue
permits

road

the
development
will
occupy
approximately
116
acres
with
the
remaining
153
acres
proposed
as
a
conservation
area
.
these
activities

153
acres
as
a

warbler
preserve
through

and
revegetate

the
applicant
considered
three
alternatives
but
rejected
two
of
them
because
they
were
not
economically
viable
