analysis
the
analysis
of
asbestos
samples
can
be
divided
into
two
major
parts
:
sample
preparation
and
microscopy
.
because
of
the
different
asbestos
uses
that
may
be
encountered
by
the
analyst
,
each
sample
may
need
different
preparation
steps
.
the
choices
are
outlined
below
.
there
are
several
different
tests
that
are
performed
to
identify
the
asbestos
species
and
determine
the
percentage
.
they
will
be
explained
below
.

preparation
begins
with
prepreparation
preparation
which
may
include
chemical
reduction
of
the
matrix
,
heating
the
sample
to
dryness
or
heating
in
the
muffle
furnace
.
the
end
result
is
a
sample
which
has
been
reduced
to
a

that
is
sufficiently
fine
to

.
analyze
different
phases
of
samples
separately
,
eg
,
tile
and
the
tile
mastic
should
be
analyzed
separately
as
the
mastic
may
contain
asbestos
while
the
tile
may
not
.

these
may
include
samples
with
tar
as
a
matrix
,
vinyl
asbestos
tile
,
or
any
other
organic
that
can
be
reduced
by
heating
.
remove
the
sample
from
the
vial
and
weigh
in
a
balance
to
determine
the
weight
of
the
submitted
portion
.
place
the
sample
in
a
muffle
furnace
at
500

circ
for
1
to
2
h
or
until
all
obvious
organic
material
has
been
removed
.
retrieve
,
cool
and
weigh
again
to
determine
the
weight
loss
on
ignition
.
this
is
necessary
to
determine
the
asbestos
content
of
the
submitted
sample
,
because
the
analyst
will
be
looking
at
a
reduced
sample
.
notes
:
heating
above
600
&
circ
will
cause
the
sample
to
undergo
a
structural
change
which
,
given
sufficient
time
,
will
convert
the
chrysotile
to
forsterite
.
heating
even
at
lower
temperatures
for
1
to
2
h
may
have
a
measurable
effect
on
the
optical
properties
of
the
minerals
.
if
the
analyst
is
unsure
of
what
to
expect
,
a
sample
of
standard
asbestos
should
be
heated
to
the
same
temperature
for
the
same
length
of
time
so
that
it
can
be
examined
for
the
proper
interpretation
.
