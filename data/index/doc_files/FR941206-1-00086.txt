the
general
provisions
do
not
specify
the

requirements

systems
.
therefore
,
the
reporting
requirements
in

of
the
proposed

apply
.
in
lieu
of
the
above
monitoring
requirements
,
the
proposed

contains
continuous

relationship
between

under

regulations
codified
at

cfr
part
70
,
any
source
that
is
a
major
source
under
the
act
,
or
any
nonmajor
source
subject
to
standards
under
sections
111
or
112
of
the
act
,
must
obtain
an
operating
permit
(
see
§
703a1
.
therefore
,
all
major
sources
subject
to
these
proposed
standards
must
obtain
an
operating
permit
.
area
sources
in
this
source
category
are
not
regulated
by
the
proposed
standards
and
would
therefore
not
be
required
to
obtain
an
operating
permit
,
unless
a
state
with
an
approved
operating
permit
program
chooses
to
permit
all
nonmajor
sources
.
there
are
many
major
sources
in
this
source
category
that
are
major
based
solely
on
their
potential
to
emit
.
such
sources
may
choose
to
obtain
a
federally
enforceable
limit
on
their
potential
to
emit
such
that
they
are
no
longer
considered
major
sources
and
not
subject
to
the
proposed
rule
.
sources
that
opt
to
limit
their
potential
to
emit
are
referred
to
by
the
epa
as
`
synthetic
area
'
sources
.
the
limiting
of
a
sources
potential
to
emit
is
identified
as
federally
enforceable
by
§
706b
)
of
part
70
.
the
committee
agreed
that
this
source
category
was
one
that
could
benefit
from
the
development
of
a
general
permit
.
under
part
70
,
state
permitting
authorities
are
allowed
to
develop
general
permits
for
categories
of
sources
containing
numerous
similar
sources
.
in
deciding
which
source
should
be
covered
by
general
permits
,
state
regulators
must
consider
three
primary
criteria
:
(
1
)
source
categories
covered
by
general
permits
should
contain
similar
operations
and
emit
pollutants
with
similar
characteristics
;
(
2
)
sources
should
not
be
subject
to
casebycase
case
by
case
standards
;
and
(
3
)
sources
should
be
subject
to
the
same
or
substantially
similar
requirements
governing
operation
,
emissions
,
monitoring
,
reporting
,
and
recordkeeping
.
general
permits
were
developed
primarily
to
alleviate
some
of
the
permitting
burden
to
area
sources
that
are
subject
to
section
112
standards
and
therefore
required
to
obtain
a
title
v
permit
.
however
,
the
preamble
to
part
70
states
that
general
permits
may
be
issued
to
cover
any
category
of
numerous
similar
sources
,
including
major
sources
.
therefore
,
the
committee
recommends
that
state
permitting
agencies
pursue
a
general
permit
for
wood
furniture
operations
.
there
are
several
benefits
to
a
general
permit
.
if
a
general
permit
developed
by
a
permitting
authority
has
been
approved
after
public
participation
,
and
the
epa
and
affected
state
review
,
the
permitting
authority
may
then
grant
or
deny
a
general
permit
to
a
source
without
further
public
participation
or
the
epa
and
affected
state
review
.
the
action
of
granting
or
denying
a
general
permit
is
also
not
subject
to
judicial
review
.
another
benefit
of
a
general
permit
that
would
be
particularly
advantageous
for
the
wood
furniture
industry
is
that
sources
may
use
general
permits
strictly
for
the
purposes
of
becoming
synthetic
area
sources
;
ie
,
limiting
the
potential
to
emit
.
finally
,
for
owners
and
operators
with
sources
in
multiple
source
categories
located
in
a
contiguous
area
,
a
general
permit
can
be
issued
to
a
discrete
affected
source
at
an
industrial
complex
.
