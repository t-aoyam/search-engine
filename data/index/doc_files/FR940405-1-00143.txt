the
comment
argued
that
the
threshold
problem
of
not
having
a
truly
solar
uvaonly
uva
only
light
source
further
complicates
the
results
obtained
using
either
ipd
method
.
the
comment
contended
that
even
filtered
xenon
lamps
contain
significant
amounts
of
visible
radiation
which
,
while
not
harmful
to
the
skin
,
may
cause
the
ipd
reaction
to
occur
.
the
comment
pointed
out
that
a
sunscreens
ability
to
block
visible
light
should
not
be
confused
or
combined
with
its
ability
to
provide
uva
protection
.
in
addition
,
the
comment
argued
that
the
light
sources
used
for
both
ipd
methods
lack
significant
energy
in
the
shorter
uva
wavelengths
,
which
are
present
in
sunlight
and
which
are
responsible
for
the
preponderance
of
uva
damage
to
the
skin
.
stating
that
there
is
great
demand
among
the
`
sunbather
'
population
for
a
`
great
looking
'
tan
and
for
an
indicator
to
predict
how
good
a
tan
can
be
obtained
with
a
product
,
one
comment
argued
that
tanning
tests
like
the
ipd
are
not
appropriate
for
measurement
of
the
damage
caused
by
uva
radiation
.
the
comment
contended
that
measures
of
melanogenesis
would
be
misinterpreted
by
consumers
as
indicators
of
efficacy
of
tanning
and
that
consumers
would
soon
be
choosing
products
with
the
lowest
ipd
rating
to
help
get
the
deepest
tan
.
one

the

test
method
(

and

.
this
method
is
similar
to
the
spf
testing
procedures
with
a
modification
to
the
light
source
to
virtually
eliminate
uvb
radiation
and
thus
expose
subjects
to
uva
radiation
(
greater
than
99
percent
.
the
pfa
test
uses
subjects
with
skin
types
i
,
ii
,
and
iii
.
the
uva
source
is
a
continuous
uva
spectrum
(
preferably
xenon
arc
)
filtered
with
a
3mm
schott
wg335
filter
that
eliminates
99
percent
of
the
uvb
radiation
,
with
less
than
1500
w
per
square
meter
(

irradiance
.
uva
exposures
are
delivered
at
25percent
percent
increments
to
skin
above
and
below
the
expected
uva
protection
level
of
the
sunscreen
product
times
the
minimal

the
endpoints
measured
in
this
testing
method
are
delayed
erythema
or
tanning
,
whichever
is
present
,
observed
16
to
24
hours
after
uv
exposure
.
the
comment
stated
that
these
acute
responses
have
similar
action
spectra
to
the
chronic
action
spectra
for
nonmelanoma
skin
cancer
(
as
determined
in
animals
,
solar
elastosis
,
and
skin
wrinkling
.
the
comment
added
that
the
data
indicate
equivalent
results
with
either
response
parameter
.
minimal
response
doses
are
elicited
with
uva
exposure
ranging
from
approximately
80
to
250

the
pfa

the
ratio
of

the
minimal

.
the
comment
submitted
the
results
of
a
multicenter
evaluation
of
sunscreens
using
pfa
methodology
(
ref
.
25
.
sunscreens
containing
2
or
5
percent
oxybenzone
,
7
percent
padimate
o
,
and
a
placebo
were
tested
in
five
laboratories
using
a
pfa
protocol
.
all
the
solar
simulators
had
intrinsic
uv
reflecting
ir
absorbing
dichroic
mirrors
and
were
fitted
with
schott
3mm
wg335
and
1mm
ug11
filters
.
the
comment
stated
that
the
pfa
test
method
yielded
reproducible
results
between
test
centers
and
was
capable
of
distinguishing
between
the
three
levels
of
uva
protection
provided
by
the
placebo
sunscreen
and
the
sunscreens
containing
2
-
or
5percent
percent
oxybenzone
.
the
test
was
incapable
of
distinguishing
between
the
uva
protection
provided
by
the
placebo
and
the
7percent
percent
padimate
o
(
a
strong
uvb
absorber
with
little
uva
absorbency
.
the
comment
stated
that
these
results
indicate
that
the
pfa
test
method
is
not
influenced
by
the
presence
of
a
strong
uvb
blocker
in
the
formulation
and
is
specific
in
identifying
uva
protection
.
the
comment
added
that
the
data
show
that
the
level
of
irradiance
of
the
light
sources
(
ie
,
300
to
1200
w
m2
)
did
not
influence
the
protection
factors
of
the
sunscreens
.
two
comments
stated
that
testing
procedures
using
modified
lamps
that
produce
mostly
uva
wavelengths
are
unsatisfactory
for
evaluating
the
uva
protection
afforded
by
a
sunscreen
drug
product
because
the
filters
required
for
such
testing
can
remove
40
percent
or
more
of
the
critical
,
damaging
wavelengths
between
320
and
340
nm
.
in
addition
,
the
comments
pointed
out
that
some
of
these
modified
lamps
contain
uvb
wavelengths
below
320
nm
that
can
overwhelm
uva
effects
.
however
,
another
comment
stated
that
pfa
values
obtained
using
modified
lamps
and
delayed
tanning
or
erythema
as
endpoints
weigh
the
uva
ii
(
320
to
340
nm
)
heavily
and
,
for
the
most
part
,
ignore
the
contribution
of
the
longer
uva
wavelengths
(
360
to
400
nm
.
one
comment
stated
that
failure
of
reciprocity
may
occur
with
very
long
exposures
and
that
making
each
test
exactly
the
same
for
each
differently
configured
uv
source
used
and
its
particular
energy
distribution
would
be
impossible
.
another
comment
stated
that
dose
reciprocity
for
the
endpoints
of
delayed
tanning
or
erythema
has
been
reported
to
fail
at
irradiances
between
10
and
50
milliwatts
per
cm
and
below
.
one
comment
noted
that
the
interval
after
exposure
at
which
the
responses
are
evaluated
can
bias
the
results
.
the
comment
added
that
the
infrared
energy
or
heat
delivered
to
the
skin
during
these
exposures
can
affect
and
alter
the
results
.
