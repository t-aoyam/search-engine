dimethyl
terephthalate
is
derived
from
the
taxable
chemicals
xylene
and
methane
.
dimethyl
terephthalate
is
a
solid
produced
predominantly
by
oxidation
of
xylene
followed
by
esterification
with
methanol
.
the
stoichiometric
material

dimethyl
terephthalate
has
been
determined
to
be
a
taxable
substance
because
a
review
of
its
stoichiometric
material
consumption
formula
shows
that
,
based
on
the
predominant
method
of
production
,
taxable
chemicals
constitute
518
percent
by

of
the
materials
used
in
its
