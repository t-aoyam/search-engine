fsis

have
a

that
is
a
protein

digestibility

this
value
is
consistent
with

this

protects

from
the
use
of

(

that

and
in

,
protects

.
fsis
also
believes
that
it
may
be

to
assure
comparability
of

that

fsis
is
proposing
to
permit
an
alternative
measurement
to
the
protein
digestibilitycorrected
digestibility
corrected
amino
acid
score
method
,
which
requires
a
digestibility
measurement
in
addition
to
an
amino

analysis
,
to
control
the
cost
of
monitoring
compliance
with
the
protein

requirement
.
fsis
is
considering
proposing
that
,
for
the
purpose
of
measuring
the
protein
quality
of

,
an
alternative
measurement
of
protein
quality
would
be
allowed
that
is
comparable
to
the
protein

amino

score
.
this
measure
would
be
based
on
a
comparison
between
the
`
essential

content
of
mdp
'
and
`
total
amino
acids
present

it
is
being
considered
that
the
essential
amino

content
would
be
determined
by
methods
given
in

fsis
believes
that
mdp
found
to
be
in
compliance
by
the
proposed
amino
acid
content
measurement
would
have
protein
of
high
quality
.
this
belief
is
supported
by
the

of
an

group
that
was
