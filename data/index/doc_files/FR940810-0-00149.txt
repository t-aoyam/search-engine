first
,
knowledge
of
the
worker
exposure
must
exist
.
the
worker
and
or
the
physician
must
be
aware
of
both
the
magnitude
and
duration
of
exposure
to
asbestos
and
the
causal
link
between
the
disease
and
the
occupational
exposure
.
furthermore
,
it
could
be
extremely
difficult
to
isolate
the
role
of
occupational
exposures
in
causing
the
disease
,
especially
if
workers
are
exposed
to
many
toxic
substances
.
second
,
the
liable
party
must
be
identifiable
,
but
workers
may
have
several
employers
over
a
working
lifetime
.
third
,
the
scientific
and
medical
evidence
available
to
support
the
contention
that
the
disease
was
caused
by
jobrelated
job
related
exposure
must
withstand
judicial
standards
for
proof
of
causality
.
this
task
is
very
difficult
because
of
the
long
latency
periods
associated
with
asbestosrelated
asbestos
related
diseases
.
the
costs
associated
with
producing
information
and
with
litigation
itself
may
be
quite
substantial
.
first
,
information
is
a
public
good
,
which
means
that
once
produced
it
can
be
transmitted
inexpensively
to
any
number
of
individuals
without
diminishing
the
quality
or
quantity
of
the
information
.
it
is
,
therefore
,
difficult
to
control
distribution
once
the
information
is
produced
.
a
producer
of
information
may
find
that
information
produced
at
great
expense
can
be
acquired
freely
by
potential
customers
,
and
that
,
consequently
,
the
market
for
the
information
has
virtually
disappeared
.
as
a
result
,
public
goods
are
typically
underproduced
relative
to
what
is
considered
economically
efficient
.
this
general
undersupply
of
information
adversely
affects
the
workers
'
awareness
of
the
cause
of
their
illness
and
thus
reduces
the
likelihood
that
they
will
pursue
tort
liability
suits
.
second
,
legal
proceedings
impose
costs
on
both
plaintiffs
and
defendants
.
victims
of
torts
must
incur
legal
fees
associated
with
bringing
about
court
action
.
in
deciding
whether
to
sue
,
the
victim
must
be
sure
that
the
size
of
the
claim
will
be
large
enough
to
cover
legal
expenses
.
in
effect
,
the
plaintiff
is
likely
to
face
substantial
transaction
costs
in
the
form
of
legal
expenses
.
these
are
commonly
set
at
a
33
percent
contingency
for
the
plaintiffs
lawyer
,
plus
legal
expenses
.
the
accused
firm
must
also
pay
for
its
defense
.
a
report
prepared
by
the
research
triangle
institute
[
rti
,
1982
,
contains
some
data
pertaining
to
legal
costs
and
the
size
of
awards
.
one
investigator
,
for
example
,
found
that
an
average
ratio
of
legal
costs
to
proceeds
was
37
percent
for
a
sample
of
cases
.
the
data
,
however
,
do
not
separate
legal
fees
paid
by
the
defendants
and
plaintiffs
.
