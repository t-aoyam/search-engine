which

would

these
included

of
at

,
three
years
driving
experience

including
an
opinion
as
to
the
drivers

to
operate
a

safely

.
a
safe
driving
record
was
defined
as
the
absence
of
chargeable
accidents
,
no
convictions
for
serious
traffic
offenses
,
and
no
more
than
two
convictions
for
other
moving
violations

the
agency
based
its
requirement
that
drivers
participating
in
the
study
have
a
threeyear
three
year
safe
driving
history
with
their
vision
impairment
upon
studies
(
discussed
more
fully

determination

indicating
that
past
experience
can
be
used
to
predict
future
performance
,
especially
when
combined
with
other
predictive
factors
such
as
geographic
location
,
mileage
driven
,
and
conviction
history
.
the
agency
also
relied
upon
opinions
from
the
medical
community
that
individuals
with
vision
impairments
are
often
able
to
compensate
for
that
impairment
over
a
period
of
time
.
because
of
the
discrepancy
as
to
how
much
time
is
necessary
to
allow
an
individual
to
compensate
for
an
impairment
(
which
generally
ranged
from
several
months
to
a
full
year
,
the
agencys
choice
of
three
years
provided
added
assurance
that
drivers
would
have
had
sufficient
time
to
develop
compensatory
behavior
.
it
was
also
the
longest

driver
histories
were

the

safety
(
advocates

filed
suit
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
dc

circuit
,
requesting
a
review
of
the
fhwas
notice
of
final
disposition
granting
waivers
to
individuals
who
otherwise
did
not
meet
the
federal
vision
standard
required
for
the
qualification
of
cmv
drivers
in
interstate
commerce
.
the
advocates
asserted
that
the
waiver
program
was
in
violation
of
the
administrative
procedures
act
(
5
usc
.
553
)
because
the
rule
implementing
the
program
was
not
issued
with
opportunity
for
meaningful
comment
and
was
otherwise
arbitrary
,
capricious
,
or
not
in
accordance
with
law
.
a
threejudge
three
judge
panel
for
the
dc
.
circuit
issued
its
opinion
in
the
case
on
08/02/1994
.
the
court
found
that
the
fhwas
notices
of
the
program
did
provide
for
meaningful
comment
and
that
the
comments
received
were
given
consideration
.
the
court
also
held
that
the
fhwas
approach
,
given
the
apparently
conflicting
demands
,
was
reasonable
,
and
therefore
not
arbitrary
and
capricious
.
the
court
observed
,
however
,
that
the
fhwa
`
initiated
a
program
to
issue
temporary
waivers
to
visually
impaired
drivers
in
order
to
procure
the
hard
evidence
needed
to
determine
the
effect
of
visual
deficiencies
on
safety
.
yet
,
before
it
may
grant
a
waiver
,
the
safety
act
required
the
agency
to
determine
that
such
waiver
*
*
*
*
*
*
is
consistent
with
the
safe
operation
of
commercial
motor
vehicles

.
the
court
found
that
the
agencys
`
determination
that
the
waiver
program
will
not
adversely
affect
the
safe
operation
of
cmvs
is
devoid
of
empirical
support
in
the
record
'
28
f

at

,
and
that
`
the
fhwa
has
failed
to
meet
the
exacting
requirements

(
now

'

.
consequently
,
the
court
concluded
that
the
fhwas
adoption
of
the
waiver
program
was
contrary
to
law
,
and
vacated
and
remanded
the
rule
to
the
agency
.
