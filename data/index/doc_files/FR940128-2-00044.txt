on

,
the
committee
for
purchase
from
people
who
are
blind
or
severely
disabled
published
notice
(
58
fr
54560
)
of
proposed
additions
to
the
procurement
list
.
comments
were
received
from
the
two
current
contractors
for
the
folders
.
one
of
the
commenters
enclosed
letters
in
support
of
its
comments
from
three
nonprofit
agencies
employing
people
with
severe
disabilities
which
have
subcontracts
to
package
folder
tabs
for
the
folders
.
that
commenter
indicated
that
addition
of
the
folders
to
the
procurement
list
would
have
a
severe
impact
on
the
firm
and
its
employees
,
particularly
when
other
recent
committee
actions
impacting
the
firm
are
taken
into
account
.
the
commenter
also
indicated
that
these
folders
provide
most
of
the
work
it
subcontracts
to
three
agencies
employing
people
with
severe
disabilities
which
make
tabs
for
use
with
the
folders
.
according
to
the
figures
available
to
the
committee
,
the
impact
of
the
loss
of
sales
for
the
folders
on
this
company
,
together
with
the
impact
of
the
earlier
actions
,
does
not
rise
to
a
level
which
the
committee
normally
considers
severe
adverse
impact
.
as
for
the
possible
loss
of
employment
for
the
commenters
workers
,
the
committee
feels
that
it
is
outweighed
by
the
creation
of
jobs
for
people
with
severe
disabilities
,
whose
unemployment
rates
greatly
exceed
those
of
people
without
disabilities
.
in
addition
,
for
at
least
the
first
two
years
after
the
jwod
agencies
assume
supply
responsibility
,
the
commenter
will
be
afforded
the
opportunity
to
compete
as
a
supplier
of
folder
tabs
to
the
nonprofit
agencies
which
will
produce
the
folders
.
thus
,
any
impact
on
this
commenters
and
its
employees
would
be
mitigated
by
the
opportunity
they
will
have
initially
to
compete
to
supply
the
folder
tabs
.
one
of
the
three
nonprofit
agencies
which
are
the
commenters
subcontractors
for
the
folder
tabs
participates
in
the
jwod
program
.
according
to
that
agency
,
its
subcontract
with
the
commenter
only
recently
produced
work
for
its
people
with
severe
disabilities
,
and
at
very
low
wages
.
while
the
nonprofit
agency
has
been
led
to
expect
a
constant
flow
of
this
work
,
it
has
no
guarantee
that
this
will
occur
.
if
the
jwodparticipating
jwod
participating
agencys
subcontract
work
volume
is
typical
of
that
provided
to
the
other
two
nonprofit
agencies
(
which
both
the
jwod
agency
and
the
figure
for
subcontractor
employees
provided
by
the
commenter
suggest
it
is
,
the
commenters
government
business
for
these
folders
is
only
a
portion
of
its
total
folder
business
.
consequently
,
even
if
the
commenter
is
not
successful
in
competing
to
supply
the
folder
tabs
to
the
nonprofit
agencies
which
will
produce
the
folders
,
addition
of
these
folders
to
the
procurement
list
should
not
markedly
diminish
the
amount
of
subcontract
work
which
would
be
available
to
the
three
nonprofit
agencies
employing
people
with
disabilities
.
moreover
,
if
the
commenter
(
or
the
jwodparticipating
jwod
participating
subcontractor
agency
)
is
successful
in
bidding
to
supply
the
folder
tabs
to
the
nonprofit
agencies
which
will
produce
the
folders
,
the
work
for
the
subcontractor
agencies
could
actually
increase
for
at
least
two
years
since
the
commenter
currently
provides
less
than
half
of
the
government
requirement
for
the
folders
.
also
,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
commenter
could
discontinue
providing
this
work
to
the
nonprofit
agencies
employing
persons
with
severe
disabilities
if
it
chose
.
the
commenter
indicated
that
it
would
take
only
a
small
investment
to
automate
this
work
.
on
the
other
hand
,
placing
the
folders
on
the
procurement
list
guarantees
that
people
with
severe
disabilities
will
be
involved
in
producing
them
for
the
government
.
the
committee
believes
the
jobs
its
action
would
create
outweigh
the
possible
loss
of
employment
for
employees
of
the
commenters
subcontractors
.
the
other
commenter
also
indicated
that
it
was
being
significantly
impacted
by
this
and
other
recent
additions
to
the
procurement
list
.
it
also
provided
a
small
amount
of
information
to
substantiate
its
claim
that
small
businesses
like
itself
are
being
forced
out
of
the
commercial
market
by
large
office
products
companies
.
because
of
this
development
,
the
impact
of
additions
to
the
procurement
list
is
magnified
as
there
are
fewer
opportunities
to
recoup
losses
to
the
procurement
list
in
the
commercial
market
.
the
impact
of
this
and
other
recent
procurement
list
additions
on
this
commenter
,
as
a
percentage
of
the
commenters
sales
,
is
less
than
half
the
impact
on
the
first
commenter
.
in
the
committees
view
,
neither
impact
rises
to
the
level
of
severe
adverse
impact
.
given
the
small
impact
figure
for
this
commenter
,
the
committee
does
not
believe
that
the
effect
of
a
shrinking
office
products
market
for
small
businesses
,
if
such
is
the
case
,
is
significant
enough
to
make
the
impact
on
this
commenter
severe
.
after
consideration
of
the
material
presented
to
it
concerning
capability
of
qualified
nonprofit
agencies
to
provide
the
commodities
,
fair
market
price
,
and
impact
of
the
addition
on
the
current
or
most
recent
contractors
,
the
committee
has
determined
that
the
commodities
listed
below
are
suitable
for
procurement
by
the
federal
government
under
41
usc
.
4648c
and
41
cfr
5124
.
i
certify
that
the
following
action
will
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
.
the
major
factors
considered
for
this
certification
were
