summary
of
public
comments
and
responses
comments
received
on
the
proposed
rule
are
placed
under
two
separate
headings
for
purposes
of
this
summary
.
the
first
addresses
the
more
general
comments
associated
with
the
proposal
,
including
those
relating
to
:
(
1
)
general
implementation
issues
of
a
listing
for
wastes
generated
by
the
wood
surface
protection
industry
;
(
2
)
technical
approaches
discussed
in
the
proposal
relating
to
data
sampling
methodologies
;
and
(
3
)
various
engineering
assumptions
on
which
the
proposed
listing
was
based
.
the
second
part
of
this
section
describes
the
agencys
response
to
comments
dealing
with
the
risk
assessment
methodology
used
to
support
the
listing
determination
for
these
wastes
.
a
.
general
comments
several
comments
were
submitted
on
the
proposed
listing
of
f033
wastes
.
four
commenters
supported
the
listing
in
general
and
two
commenters
supported
the
concentrationbased
concentration
based
approach
in
particular
.
three
commenters
opposed
the
proposed
listing
and
urged
epa
to
rely
on
its
authority
under
fifra
to
control
the
risks
posed
by
chlorophenolic
formulations
.
one
commenter
supported
an
outright
ban
on
the
use
of
chlorophenolics
for
wood
surface
treatment
.
two
commenters
warned
that
listing
f033
wastes
would
hinder
remediation
efforts
at
contaminated
wood
surface
protection
sites
.
the
agency
agrees
with
the
commenters
'
point
that
a
hazardous
waste
listing
may
provide
a
disincentive
for
owner
operators
of
surface
protection
plants
to
initiate
voluntary
remediation
efforts
.
the
regulation
of
potentially
large
amounts
of
contaminated
soil
as
listed
hazardous
waste
could
delay
the
start
of
cleanup
due
to
the
administrative
and
economic
realities
of
regulatory
compliance
.
three
commenters
expressed
concern
over
the
possibly
perceived
interchangeability
of
the
proposed
01
ppm
concentration
level
and
the
toxicity
characteristic
(
tc
)
regulatory
level
for
pentachlorophenol
.
although
the
agency
is
not
finalizing
the
f033
hazardous
waste
listing
,
epa
nevertheless
wants
to
make
clear
that
the
concentration
level
proposed
in
the
f033
listing
description
was
not
intended
as
a
regulatory
level
for
any
purpose
other
than
defining
a
waste
as
f033
.
the
current
regulatory
level
for
pentachlorophenol
that
defines
a
waste
as
hazardous
under
the
tc
(
100
mg
l
)
would
not
have
been
affected
by
this
rulemaking
in
any
way
had
the
f033
listing
been
promulgated
today
.
levels
set
for
the
tc
are
obtained
by
running
models
which
simulate
acidic
landfill
conditions
.
for
the
proposed
listing
,
the
proposed
01
ppm
level
was
calculated
using
a
maximum
contaminant
level
(
mcl
)
of
0
001
ppm
and
a
risk
analysis
using
the
agencys
multimed
multi
med
model
.
multimed
multi
med
simulates
groundwater
contamination
from
specific
sources
,
and
for
this
proposal
,
it
incorporated
variables
which
are
specific
to
sawmill
conditions
.
the
agencys
analysis
approximated
the
dilution
of
pentachlorophenate
from
the
time
the
waste
contacts
the
ground
to
when
it
reaches
a
ground
water
well
.
the
agency
did
not
arrive
at
the
01
ppm
level
by
applying
a
dilution
attenuation
factor
(
daf
)
of
100
(
as
the
agency
has
done
in
other
circumstances
)
to
the
mcl
.
indeed
,
the
agency
did
not
take
a
position
in
the
proposal
about
the
use
of
dafs
in
calculating
acceptable
risk
levels
for
any
constituents
.
a
detailed
discussion
of
the
agencys
modeling
assumptions
and
actual
parameters
used
to
generate
risk
approximations
can
be
found
in
the
docket
for
the
proposed
rule
.
one
commenter
expressed
reservations
regarding
the
decontamination
procedures
promulgated
previously
for
wood
preserving
equipment
(

,

.
the
agency
is
aware
that
equipment
cleaning
will
not
always
prevent
crosscontamination
cross
contamination
.
however
,
it
will
certainly
reduce
the
amount
of
contamination
that
would
occur
if
no
equipment
cleaning
took
place
.
although
the
agency
is
not
finalizing
the
proposed
f033
hazardous
waste
listing
,
epa
encourages
owner
operators
of
surface
protection
plants
to
clean
or
replace
any
surfacetreating
surface
treating
equipment
that
was
used
previously
with
chlorophenolic
formulations
upon
a
switch
to
nonchlorophenolic
chlorophenolic
chemicals
and
properly
dispose
of
the
wastes
in
an
environmentally
sound
manner
.
furthermore
,
the
agency
has
obtained
information
which
shows
that
some
new
substitute
products
are
more
effective
if
residual
chlorophenolic
contamination
is
removed
.
hence
,
removing
sludge
and
cleaning
equipment
from
previous
chlorophenolic
use
will
not
only
be
more
environmentally
sound
,
but
may
also
enhance
the
new
products
effectiveness
.
methodology
on
recommended
cleaning
and
operating
practices
for
surface
protectors
will
be
published
in
the
near
future
by
the
agency
in
a
pollution
prevention
and
waste
minimization
guidance
document
.
one
commenter
suggested
that
the
proposed
operating
standards
for
surface
protection
plants
be
codified
in
part
262
as
opposed
to
parts
264/265
.
the
commenter
reasoned
that
most
surface
protection
plants
are
only
generators
and
do
not
function
as
treatment
,
storage
,
and
disposal
facilities
(
tsdfs
.
however
,
since
the
f033
hazardous
waste
listing
is
not
being
promulgated
,
this
issue
is
moot
and
there
is
no
need
for
special
generator
requirements
.
several
commenters
had
specific
concerns
about
the
applicability
of
the
proposed
f033
listing
.
since
the
agency
is
not
finalizing
the
proposed
f033
listing
,
these
concerns
are
also
moot
.
however
,
where
appropriate
,
answers
specific
to
each
of
these
comments
have
been
addressed
in
the
background
document
of
this
final
rule
.
one
commenter
questioned
the
representativeness
of
the
agencys
data
on
crosscontamination
cross
contamination
.
the
commenter
stated
that
because
sites
were
not
randomly
selected
,
there
is
no
true
sample
representation
of
the
surface
protector
population
.
epa
did
not
choose
sampling
sites
based
on
their
statistical
representativeness
.
rather
,
the
sites
were
selected
as
appropriate
from
what
the
agency
considered
to
be
typical
operating
plants
.
the
agency
visited
more
than
15
surface
protection
sites
in
the
nation
(
both
large
and
small
plants
.
from
the
information
obtained
from
these
plant
tours
and
interviews
,
the
agency
developed
a
view
of
what
it
considered
typical
from
an
engineering
standpoint
(
(
eg
.
size
of
equipment
,
production
scale
,
presence
of
containment
systems
,
size
of
storage
yards
,
amount
of
drippage
,
etc
.
the
sites
sampled
need
not
represent
the
entire
surface
protection
industry
in
terms
of
the
process
used
and
the
degree
of
crosscontamination
cross
contamination
present
to
allow
the
agency
to
demonstrate
that
wastes
from
current
and
previous
use
of
chlorophenolics
at
surface
protection
sites
were
contaminated
with
the
constituents
of
concern
.
these
sites
were
chosen
from
information
obtained
by
a
questionnaire
sent
out
under
the
agencys
3007
rcra
authority
.
