section

.
eligible
activities
and
funding
priorities
l
.
what
type
of
activities
are
eligible
for
funding
under
this
program
?
as
specified
in
the
act
,
the
environmental
education
activities
that
are
eligible
to
receive
funding
under
this
program
must
include
at
least
one
of
,
but
are
not
limited
to
,
the
following
:
1
.
the
design
,
demonstration
,
or
dissemination
of
environmental
curricula
,
including
development
of
educational
tools
and
material
;
2
.
the
design
and
demonstration
of
field
methods
,
practices
,
and
techniques
,
including
assessment
of
environmental
and
ecological
conditions
and
analysis
of
environmental
pollution
problems
;
3
.
the
assessment
of
a
specific
environmental
issue
or
a
specific
environmental
problem
;
4
.
the
provision
of
training
or
related
education
for
teachers
,
faculty
,
or
related
personnel
in
a
specific
geographic
area
or
region
;
and
5
.
the
design
and
demonstration
of
projects
to
foster
international
cooperation
in
addressing
environmental
issues
and
problems
involving
the
united
states
and
canada
or
mexico
.
in
reference
to
section
ivl1
.
above
,
epa
strongly
encourages
applicants
to
focus
on
the
demonstration
or
dissemination
of
existing
environmental
curricula
rather
than
the
design
or
development
of
new
curricula
.
environmental
educators
and
other
experts
have
conveyed
to
epa
that
the
field
needs
to
improve
its
use
and
dissemination
of
existing
curricula
more
than
it
needs
to
develop
new
curricula
.
focusing
on
demonstrating
or
disseminating
existing
curricula
will
also
help
ensure
that
federal
funds
are
not
used
to
duplicate
already
existing
curricula
.
nonetheless
,
epa
does
recognize
that
there
are
gaps
in
the
types
of
curricula
that
presently
exist
and
that
there
is
some
difficulty
in
gaining
access
to
quality
materials
.
thus
,
applicants
who
propose
to
design
new
curricula
in
their
preapplications
applications
must
demonstrate
that
there
is
a
need
to
develop
these
new
materials
.
for
example
,
the
applicant
may
show
that
the
curriculum
proposed
for
development
has
not
been
designed
for
a
particular
target
audience
,
that
existing
curricula
cannot
be
adapted
well
to
a
particular
local
environmental
concern
,
or
that
existing
curricula
are
not
otherwise
readily
accessible
.
in
demonstrating
the
need
for
new
curricula
,
the
applicant
must
specify
what
steps
they
have
taken
to
determine
this
need
(
eg
,
the
applicant
may
cite
a
conference
where
this
need
was
discussed
,
the
results
of
inquiries
made
within
the
community
or
with
various
educational
institutions
or
organizations
,
or
a
published
survey
or
research
document
.
m
.
what
activities
are
not
eligible
for
funding
under
this
program
?
funds
cannot
be
used
for
:
1
.
construction
projects
;
2
.
technical
training
of
environmental
management
professionals
;
3
.
noneducational
educational
research
and
development
;
and
or
4
.
environmental
information
projects
.
