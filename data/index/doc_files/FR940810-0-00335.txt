comment

one
commenter
contended
that
these
regulations
are
fundamentally
flawed
because
the
`
need
'
for
the
exception
is
wholly
without
merit
.
defending
nationally
normed
tests
,
the
commenter
disputed
that
new
state
assessment
systems
would
provide
more
meaningful
data
and
asserted
that
new
and
traditional
assessment
systems
are
not
mutually
exclusive
.
discussion
:
the
commenter
may
have
missed
the
point
of
these
regulations
.
the
regulations
do
not
require
any
state
to
make
changes
in
its
chapter
1
or
mep
testing
programs
.
even
a
state
that
has
developed
an
assessment
system
to
support
its
education
reform
efforts
will
not
be
required
to
use
that
system
to
evaluate
its
chapter
1
or
mep
programs
.
at
the
same
time
,
however
,
the
secretary
does
not
want
the
current
national
evaluation
standards
to
stand
in
the
way
of
a
states
efforts
,
in
reforming
its
educational
system
,
to
define
what
all
students
should
be
expected
to
know
,
train
instructional
staff
to
teach
those
subjects
,
and
assess
whether
students
,
in
fact
,
have
learned
what
they
should
know
.
in
particular
,
the
secretary
believes
that
states
that
are
pursuing
this
kind
of
reform
,
and
that
have
already
developed
their
own
measures
for
assessing
what
all
children
should
know
,
should
be
free
to
use
those
assessments
to
evaluate
their
states
'
chapter
1
and
mep
programs
if
they
are
satisfied
that
these
measures
provide
more
meaningful
information
on
the
progress
of
participating
children
than
does
use
of
the
current
national
standards
.
the
current
national
evaluation
standards
preclude
a
state
from
making
this
choice
.
to
the
extent
that
a
states
assessment
system
does
not
rely
on
a
nationally
normed
test
or
fails
to
assess
every
participating
child
in
grades
2
through
12
,
it
is
inconsistent
with
,
and
therefore
cannot
be
used
to
satisfy
,
the
current
national
evaluation
standards
.
changes
:
none

comment
:
one
commenter
interpreted
the
secretarys
desire
to
eliminate
dual
testing
as
a
determination
that
multiple
measures
are
inconsistent
with
the
current
chapter
1
evaluation
requirements
.
the
commenter
asserted
that
a
rationale
for
the
proposed
exception
premised
on
a
single
assessment
theory
is
inconsistent
with
current
law
.
discussion
:
the
commenter
may
have
misinterpreted
the
secretarys
rationale
for
proposing
an
exception
to
the
national
evaluation
standards
.
the
secretary
is
not
requiring
use
of
a
sole
assessment
criterion
.
rather
,
like
the
commenter
,
the
secretary
encourages
multiple
assessment
measures
and
anticipates
that
most
,
if
not
all
,
state
assessment
systems
qualifying
for
an
exception
would
consist
of
multiple
measures
.
on
the
other
hand
,
the
secretary
is
trying
to
eliminate
the
need
for
a
state
to
administer
dual
tests
,
ie
,
administering
a
particular
type
of
test
merely
to
satisfy
the
chapter
1
national
evaluation
standards
while
administering
an
acceptable
alternative
assessment
system
for
the
states
own
purposes
.
changes
:
none
.
comment
:
one
commenter
suggested
that
,
instead
of
granting
exceptions
,
the
secretary
revise
the
regulations
to
require
the
use
of
multiple
measures
,
including
normreferenced
norm
referenced
tests
.
according
to
the
commenter
,
although
it
is
appropriate
to
use
additional
assessments
that
could
provide
critical
evidence
of
whether
children
are
performing
at
an
appropriate
level
,
normreferenced
norm
referenced
tests
should
also
be
used
because
they
meet
the
technical
standards
of
reliability
and
validity
.
discussion
:
as
noted
above
,
the
secretary
encourages
the
use
of
multiple
assessment
measures
.
the
secretary
does
not
agree
that
normreferenced
norm
referenced
tests
should
be
required
as
one
measure
.
changes
:
none
.
comment
:
one
commenter
asked
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
an
sea
or
lea
to
have
a
mixed
systemfor
example
,
normreferenced
norm
referenced
tests
to
measure
sustained
effects
;
alternative
measures
for
assessing
math
and
reading
.
discussion
:
the
regulations
permit
states
to
use
any
assessment
measures
or
combination
of
measures
that
are
appropriate
and
that
meet
new
,
less
prescriptive
national
standards
.
changes
:
none
.
comment
:
one
commenter
suggested
that
,
if
an
exception
is
granted
,
the
eligibility
standards
for
entry
into
chapter
1
programs
would
be
relaxed
to
the
point
that
subjective
teacher
recommendations
would
determine
participation
.
discussion
:
these
regulations
do
not
alter
the
criteria
for
identifying
and
selecting
children
for
participation
in
chapter
1
or
mep
programs
.
under
chapter
1
,
for
example
,
children
must
still
be
identified
as
educationally
deprived
`
on
the
basis
of
educationally
related
objective
criteria
established
by
the
[
lea
]
which
include
written
or
oral
testing
instruments
'
this
requirement
,
however
,
does
not
mandate
a
specific
type
of
assessment
,
particularly
one
that
uses
a
nationally
normed
test
.
an
lea
may
use
whatever
educationally
related
objective
criteria
it
deems
appropriate
.
thus
,
to
the
extent
the
state
assessment
system
meets
the
leas
needs
,
it
may
also
serve
to
identify
and
select
children
for
participation
in
chapter
1
.
on
the
other
hand
,
to
the
extent
the
state
assessment
system
does
not
provide
sufficient
information
on
specific
children
,
the
lea
would
need
to
use
additional
measures
to
select
children
for
participation
in
chapter
1
programs
.
changes
:
none
.
comment
:
one
commenter
felt
that
accountability
could
be
skewed
if
test
results
are
obtained
only
from
a
single
grade
level
.
another
commenter
feared
that
information
from
only
one
grade
level
would
not
provide
adequate
evidence
of
school
effectiveness
.
discussion
:
there
is
no
statutory
or
regulatory
requirement
that
a
state
limit
its
assessment
of
its
chapter
1
or
mep
programs
to
a
single
grade
level
per
school
.
indeed
,
if
a
state
believes
that
one
grade
does
not
adequately
represent
the
progress
of
children
in
chapter
1
or
mep
or
the
effectiveness
of
a
school
,
it
should
assess
children
in
other
grades
to
achieve
an
adequate
picture
of
their
progress
.
