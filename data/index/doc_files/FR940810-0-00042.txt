regulatory
history
osha
has
regulated
asbestos
several
times
as
more
information
has
become
available
.
asbestos
rulemakings
marked
the
early
years
of
the
agency
.
a
12
f
cc
permissible
exposure
limit
(
pel
)
for
asbestos
was
included
in
the
initial
promulgation
on
05/29/1971
(
36
fr
10466
)
of
osha
standards
pursuant
to
section
6a
)
of
the
act
.
in
response
to
a
petition
by
the
industrial
union
department
of
the
aflcio
afl
cio
,
osha
issued
an
emergency
temporary
standard
(
ets
)
on
asbestos
on
12/07/1971
,
which
established
a
pel
of
5
f
cc
as
an
8hour
hour
timeweighted
time
weighted
average
(
twa
)
and
a
peak
exposure
level
of
10
f
cc
.
in
06/19/1972
,
osha
promulgated
a
new
final
standard
that
established
an
8hour
hour
twa
pel
of
5
f
cc
and
a
ceiling
limit
of
10
f
cc
.
these
limits
were
intended
primarily
to
protect
employees
against
asbestosis
,
and
it
was
hoped
that
they
would
provide
some
incidental
degree
of
protection
against
asbestos
induced
forms
of
cancer
.
effective
07/19/1976
,
oshas
8hour
hour
twa
limit
was
reduced
to
2
f
cc
and
this
limit
remained
in
effect
up
to
the
effective
date
of
the
revised
1986
standards
.
in
10/19/1975
,
osha
published
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
(
40
fr
47652
)
to
revise
the
asbestos
standard
because
the
agency
believed
that
`
sufficient
medical
and
scientific
evidence
has
been
accumulated
to
warrant
the
designation
of
asbestos
as
a
human
carcinogen
'
and
that
advances
in
monitoring
and
protective
technology
made
reexamination
examination
of
the
standard
`
desirable
'
this
proposal
would
have
reduced
the
8hour
hour
twa
to
05
f
cc
and
imposed
a
ceiling
limit
of
5
f
cc
for
15
minutes
.
the
1975
proposal
would
have
applied
to
all
industries
except
construction
.
at
that
time
no
separate
proposal
applicable
to
the
construction
industry
was
developed
by
the
agency
.
on
05/24/1983
osha
consulted
with
the
advisory
committee
for
construction
safety
and
health
(
accsh
)
concerning
the
applicability
of
any
new
asbestos
standard
to
the
construction
industry
.
accsh
endorsed
oshas
position
that
any
new
pel
adopted
for
general
industry
should
also
apply
to
the
construction
industry
(
ex

.
on
11/04/1983
osha
published
an
ets
for
asbestos
(
48
fr
51096
.
the
ets
marked
a
new
regulatory
initiative
,
related
to
,
but
not
part
of
the
1975
proceeding
.
the
ets
was
held
invalid
by
the
uscircuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
on
03/07/1984
.
subsequently
,
osha
published
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
(
49
fr
1416
,
04/10/1984
)
for
a
standard
covering
occupational
exposure
to
asbestos
in
all
work
places
subject
to
the
act
.
pursuant
to
section
6c
)
of
the
act
,
the
ets
also
served
as
a
proposed
rule
.
on
06/17/1986
,
osha
issued
two
revised
standards
,
one
governing
occupational
exposure
to
asbestos
in
general
industry
workplaces
,
the
other
applicable
to
construction
workplaces
(
51
fr
22612
et
seq
,
06/20/1986
.
effective
07/21/1986
,
the
revised
standards
amended
oshas
previous
asbestos
standard
issued
in
1972
.
the
1986
standards
explicitly
applied
to
occupational
exposure
to
nonasbestiform
asbestiform
tremolite
,
anthophyllite
and
actinolite
.
after
a
subsequent
and
separate
rulemaking
proceeding
osha
has
deleted
these
minerals
from
the
scope
of
the
asbestos
standards
.
