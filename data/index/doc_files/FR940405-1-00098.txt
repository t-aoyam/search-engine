workers
'
compensation
.
the
workers
'
compensation
system
is
a
result
of
the
perceived
inadequacies
in
liability
or
insurance
systems
to
compel
employers
to
prevent
occupational
disease
or
compensate
workers
fully
for
their
losses
.
the
system
was
designed
to
internalize
some
of
the
social
costs
of
production
,
but
in
reality
it
has
fallen
short
of
compensating
workers
adequately
for
occupationally
related
disease
.
thus
,
society
shares
the
burden
of
occupationally
related
health
effects
,
premature
mortality
,
excess
morbidity
,
and
disability
through
taxpayer
support
of
social
programs
such
as
welfare
,
social
security
disability
payments
,
and
medicare
.
compensation
tends
to
be
inadequate
especially
in
permanent
disability
cases
,
in
view
of
the
expiration
of
benefit
entitlement
and
the
failure
to
adjust
benefits
for
changes
in
a
workers
expected
earnings
over
time
.
as
of
january
1987
,
eight
states
restricted
permanent
disability
benefits
either
by
specifying
a
maximum
number
of
weeks
for
which
benefits
could
be
paid
or
by
imposing
a
ceiling
on
dollar
payments
[
ex
.
4302
.
at
present
,
time
and
dollar
restrictions
on
benefit
payments
are
even
more
prevalent
in
the
area
of
survivor
benefits
.
the
duration
of
survivor
benefits
is
often
restricted
to
10
years
,
and
dollar
maximums
on
survivor
payments
range
from
$
7000
to
$
60000
.
in
addition
,
it
should
be
noted
that
if
the
employee
dies
quickly
from
the
occupational
illness
and
has
no
dependents
,
the
employer
need
pay
only
nominal
damages
under
workers
'
compensation
(
eg
,
a
$
1000
death
benefit
.
finally
,
in
spite
of
current
statutory
protection
,
disability
from
occupational
diseases
represents
a
continuing
,
complex
problem
for
workers
'
compensation
programs
.
occupational
diseases
may
take
years
to
develop
,
and
more
than
one
causal
agent
may
be
involved
in
their
onset
.
consequently
,
disabilities
resulting
from
occupationally
induced
illness
often
are
less
clearly
defined
than
those
from
occupationally
induced
injury
.
as
a
result
,
workers
'
compensation
is
often
a
weak
remedy
in
the
case
of
occupational
disease
.
indeed
,
there
is
some
evidence
indicating
that
the
great
majority
of
occupationally
induced
illnesses
are
never
reported
or
compensated
[
ex
.
484
.
the
insurance
premiums
paid
by
a
firm
under
the
workers
'
compensation
system
are
generally
not
experience
rated
;
that
is
,
they
do
not
reflect
the
individual
firms
job
safety
and
health
record
.
about
80
percent
of
all
firms
are
ineligible
for
experience
rating
because
of
their
small
size
.
such
firms
are
class
rated
,
and
rate
reductions
are
granted
only
if
the
experience
of
the
entire
class
improves
.
even
when
firms
have
an
experience
rating
,
the
premiums
paid
may
not
accurately
reflect
the
true
economic
losses
.
segregation
of
loss
experience
into
classes
is
somewhat
arbitrary
,
and
an
individual
firm
may
be
classified
with
other
firms
that
have
substantially
different
normal
accident
rates
.
an
experience
rating
is
generally
based
on
the
benefits
paid
to
workers
,
not
on
the
firms
safety
record
.
thus
,
employers
may
have
a
greater
incentive
to
reduce
premiums
by
contesting
claims
than
by
initiating
safety
measures
.
in
summary
,
the
workers
'
compensation
system
suffers
from
several
shortcomings
that
seriously
reduce
its
effectiveness
in
providing
incentives
for
firms
to
create
safe
and
healthful
workplaces
.
the
scheduled
benefits
are
significantly
less
than
the
actual
losses
to
the
injured
workers
,
and
recovery
is
often
very
difficult
in
the
case
of
occupational
diseases
.
thus
,
the
existence
of
a
workers
'
compensation
system
limits
an
employers
liability
significantly
below
the
actual
costs
of
the
injury
.
in
addition
,
premiums
for
individual
firms
are
unlikely
to
be
specifically
related
to
that
firms
risk
environment
.
the
firm
,
therefore
,
does
not
receive
the
proper
economic
signals
and
consequently
fails
to
invest
sufficient
resources
in
reducing
workplace
injuries
and
illnesses
.
the
economic
costs
not
borne
by
the
employer
are
borne
by
the
employee
or
,
as
is
often
the
case
,
by
society
through
public
insurance
and
welfare
programs
.
