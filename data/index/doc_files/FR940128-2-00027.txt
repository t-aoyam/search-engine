this

adopts

which
specifies
the
use
of
a
subset
of
the
open

and
interchange

standard
.
the
oda
standard
supports
the
interchange
of
compound
documents
containing
up
to
three
types
of
contents
:
character
(
text
,
raster
graphics
,
and
geometric
graphics
.
developed
by
international
standards
organizations
,
the
oda
standard
specifies
rules
for
describing
the
logical
and
layout
structures
of
documents
as
well
as
rules
for
specifying
character
,
raster
graphics
,
and
geometric
graphics
content
of
documents
,
thus
providing
for
the
interchange
of
complex
documents
.
the
oda
standard
was
developed
primarily
by
the
international

for
standardization

and
the

a
dap
is
a
functional
subset
of
the
oda
standard
and
facilitates
the
interchange
of
documents
among
different
document
systems
by
specifying
the
constraints
on
document
structure
and
content
according
to
the
rules
of
the
oda
standard
.
the
oda
raster
dap
specifies
an
interchange
format
suitable
for
the
transfer
of
structured
documents
between
systems
designed
for
raster
graphics
applications
.
the
documents
supported
by
this
standard
are
based
on
a
paradigm
of

objectives
.
the
fips
for
oda

permits
federal
departments
and
agencies
to
exercise
more
effective
control
over
the

.
the
primary
objectives
of
this
standard
are
:
_
to
promote
interchange
of
structured
documents
containing
raster
graphics
images
between
image
processing
systems
of

,
_
to
facilitate
the
use
of
advanced
technology
by

,
_
to
stimulate
the
development
of
commercial
products
compatible
with
the
oda
standard
and
with
