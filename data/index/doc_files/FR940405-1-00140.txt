another

contended
that
the
diffey

has
been
shown
to
have
poor
correlation
with

the
comment
stated
that
the
diffey
and
robson
method
has
been
used
as
the
basis
for
`
quantifying
'
uva
protection

without
using
an
action
spectrum
such
as
the
cie
uv
hazard
spectrum
or
the
erythemal
efficacy
spectrum
for
weighting
,
the
`
star
'
method
considers
all
uva
wavelengths
as
having
the
same
erythemal
effectiveness
.
the
`
star
'
value
results
from
an
unweighted
ratio
of
the
uva
absorbance
to
the
uvb
absorbance
of
the
product
.
therefore
,
the
comment
maintained
that
a
low
spf
product
with
a
flat
absorbance
spectrum
could
get
four
`
stars
'
(
ie
,
the
highest
rating
,
while
a
higher
spf
product
would
get
fewer
`
stars
'
because
the
higher
spf
product
would
absorb
disproportionately
higher
levels
of
uvb
,
similar
to
the
action
spectrum
for
erythema
.
the
comment
stated
that
the
`
star
'
concept
is
in
direct
contrast
to
the
accepted
concept
of
formulating
sunscreen
drug
products
to
provide
the
most
protection
in
the
most
damaging
portion
of
the
uv
spectrum
.
the
comment
contended
that
the
`
star
'
method
is
misleading
to
consumers
and
added
that
the
use
of
the
`
star
'
method
in
england
has
been
criticized
by
dermatologists
,
who
have
asked
that
the
system
be
withdrawn
.
one

recommended
that
the

adopt
the
current

as
an

this
method
measures
the

of

if

not
transmit

10

from

to

nm
inclusive
,
the
product
may
be
considered
as
providing
broad

protection
.
the
comment
contended
that
this
method
has
a
number
of
advantages
.
uv
protection
claims
are
most
appropriately
substantiated
by
measuring
the
blocking
of
uv
directly
rather
than
measuring
some
consequence
of
uva
exposure
.
thin

of
sunscreen

reached
a
level
of
technical
proficiency
to
permit

adopting
an
already
accepted
standard
protocol
will
enhance
the
ability
of
the
united

industry
to
compete
equally
in
foreign
markets
.
this
test
will
substantially
reduce

the
comment
added
that
this

provides
a
strict
criterion
that
serves
to
identify
only
the
most
effective
uva
blockers

two
comments
contended
that
there
are
several
deficiencies
in
the
sas
method
.
the
results
are
not
correlated
to
a
clinical
spf
test
.
numerous
studies
have
shown
that
solution
and
thinfilm
thin
film
spectra
are
not
relevant
to
actual
product
performance
on
skin
.
the
performance
of
the
sunscreen
is
evaluated
only
in
the
limited
range
of
320
to
360
nm
,
rather
than
throughout
the
entire
uva
spectrum
(
320
to
400
nm
.
two
comments
recommended
that
the
agency
not
adopt
in
vitro
methods
that
rely
on
measuring
the
transmission
of
uva
radiation
through
either
epidermis
or
a
uvtransparent
uv
transparent
skin
cast
(
refs
.
18
and
19
.
the
comments
contended
that
these
methods
are
inappropriate
because
they
use
nonsolar
uva
radiation
sources
and
limited
range
uva
detectors
or
detectors
without
an
appropriately
weighted
response
.
the
comments
stated
that
these
limitations
would
cause
the
results
to
be
nonrelevant
to
the
actual
responses
of
normal
skin
to
fullspectrum
full

natural
sunlight
.
the
comments
mentioned
that
one
method
(
ref
.
19
)
contains
a
small
but
significant
contamination
by
uvb
energy
below
320
nm
that
would
adversely
affect
the
resulting
efficacy
values
and
lead
to
erroneous
measures
of
uva
efficacy
.
the
comments
stated
that
the
other
method
(
ref
.
18
)
skews
results
toward
the
longer
uva
wavelengths
because
of
the
lamps
deficiencies
in
the
shorter
,
energyrich
energy
rich
uva
.
the
comments
added
that
this
skewing
causes
an
overestimation
of
the
protection
of
some
products
,
making
those
with
ingredients
that
are
long
wavelength
absorbers
(
such
as
avobenzone
)
look
unrealistically
effective
.
one
comment
concluded
that
a
rigorous
and
foolproof
in
vitro
test
method
has
not
been
established
or
validated
.
the
comment
submitted
two
scientific
publications
that
discuss
some
of
the
difficulties
associated
with
in
vitro
sunscreen
testing
techniques
(
refs
.
15
and
20
.
the
comment
argued
that
none
of
the
current
in
vitro
methods
adequately
evaluate
the
photostability
of
sunscreens
.
it
further
stated
that
a
validated
in
vivo
human
uva
test
method
must
first
be
established
.
then
,
future
in

test
methods
can
be
tested
and
validated
against
this
standard
.
