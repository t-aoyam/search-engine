areas
inside
an
ozone
transport
region
section
182f
)
of
the
clean
air
act
provides
a
different
test
for
exempting
areas
in
an
ozone
transport
region
from
no
requirements
(
see
section
ic
.
of
this
preamble
.
in
particular
,
that
test
requires
a
demonstration
that
shows
additional
no
reductions
would
not
produce
net
ozone
benefits
in
the
transport
region
as
a
whole
.
since
the
requirement
for
meeting
this
test
is
substantially
different
from
that
needed
to
meet
the
contributetoattainment
contribute
to
attainment
test
in
section
182f1a
,
and
since
the
language
in
the
conformity
rule
clearly
does
not
reflect
the
language
of
the
test
provided
for
areas
in
an
ozone
transport
region
,
the
determination
of
how
such
areas
would
qualify
for
an
exemption
from
the
rules
no
requirements
merits
more
consideration
before
epa
can
issue
appropriate
guidance
.
todays
guidance
therefore
applies
only
to
no
exemptions
for
areas
outside
the
ozone
transport
region
.
as
noted
previously
,
requests
for
conformity
no
exemptions
must
consider
the
nonattainment
area
as
a
whole
.
with
respect
to
transportation
conformity
,
no
exemptions
will
not
be
granted
for
portions
of
nonattainment
areas
.
therefore
,
nonattainment
areas
with
portions
both
inside
and
outside
the
ozone
transport
region
will
be
treated
for
purposes
of
such
exemption
requests
as
areas
inside
the
ozone
transport
region
,
and
for
the
present
time
,
will
not
be
eligible
for
an
exemption
based
on
monitoring
data
as
described
in
this
notice
.
epa
will
give
further
consideration
to
areas
in
the
ozone
transport
region
,
and
if
epa
does
propose
to
exempt
some
of
these
areas
,
they
will
be
addressed
in
statespecific
state
specific
rulemaking
notices
unless
another
general
preamble
providing
guidance
for
such
areas
is
published
first
.

process
for
receiving
a
no
exemption
based
on
monitoring
data
for
nonclassifiable
areas
epa
believes
that
section
182f
)
sets
up
two
separate
procedures
by
which
epa
may
act
on
no
exemption
requests
.
subsections
182f
)
(

)
and
(

)
direct
that
action
on
no
exemption
determination
requests
should
take
place
`
when
[
epa
]
approves
a
plan
or
plan
revision
'
this
language
appears
to
contemplate
that
exemption
requests
submitted
under
these
paragraphs
are
limited
to
states
,
since
states
are
the
entities
authorized
under
the
act
to
submit
plans
or
plan
revisions
.
by
contrast
,
subsection
182f3
)
provides
that
`
persons
]
'
'
may
petition
for
a
no
determination
`
at
any
time
'
after
the
ozone
precursor
study
required
under
section
185b
of
the
act
is
finalized
,
and
gives
epa
a
limit
of
six
months
after
filing
to
grant
or
deny
such
petitions
.
although
subsection
182f3
)
references
section
182f1
,
epa
believes
that
paragraph
(
f3s
reference
to
paragraph
(
f1
)
encompasses
only
the
substantive
tests
in
paragraph
(
f1
)
(
and
,
by
extension
,
paragraph
(
f2
,
not
the
requirement
in
paragraph
(
f1
)
for
epa
to
grant
exemptions
only
when
acting
on
plan
revisions
.

accordingly
,
petitions
submitted
under
subsection
182f3
)
are
not
required
to
be
submitted
as
state
implementation
plan
(
sip
)
revisions
.
consequently
,
the
state
is
not
required
under
the
act
to
hold
a
public
hearing
in
order
to
petition
for
an
areawide
no
exemption
determination
under
section
182f3
)
(
see
clean
air
act
sections
110a
)
(
1
)
and
(
2
.
for
similar
reasons
,
if
the
state
is
submitting
an
areawide
petition
under
subsection
182f3
,
it
is
unnecessary
to
have
the
governor
submit
the
petition
.
however
,
because
of
the
need
for
consistency
with
the
airs
data
and
the
requirements
of
40
cfr
part
58
,
epa
believes
that
,
particularly
in
cases
where
the
no
exemption
request
(
including
a
request
for
exemption
from
the
no
requirements
of
the
conformity
rules
)
is
based
on
monitoring
data
,
if
such
data
is
contained
in
a
petition
submitted
by
a
person
other
than
the
state
,
the
petition
should
be
coordinated
with
the
state
air
agency
.
lack
of
endorsement
by
the
state
air
agency
will
require
more
scrutiny
by
epa
,
and
therefore
epas
processing
of
the
petition
will
likely
take
more
time
.
epa
will
grant
or
deny
a
petition
for
an
areawide
no
transportation
conformity
exemption
through
a
full
rulemaking
process
.
this
may
involve
a
direct
final
rule
or
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
followed
by
a
final
rule
.
either
process
allows
opportunity
for
public
comment
.
for
areas
which
are
relying
on
monitoring
data
which
demonstrates
attainment
,
the
notice
and
comment
will
provide
opportunity
for
comment
on
the
preliminary
interpretations
contained
in
this
general
preamble
.
these
rulemakings
will
also
offer
opportunity
for
comment
on
the
appropriateness
of
using
monitoring
data
which
is
consistent
with
the
requirements
in
40
cfr
part
58
and
consistent
with
the
data
recorded
in
airs
as
the
basis
of
epas
approval
and
rescission
of
the
contingent
no
exemption
.
if
epa
issues
a
final
rulemaking
concluding
that
it
will
use
such
air
quality
monitoring
data
in
making
subsequent
determination
that
an
area
has
violated
the
standard
,
no
further
notice
and
comment
will
be
required
in
order
to
rescind
the
no
exemption
in
the
event
that
such
data
subsequently
indicates
that
a
violation
has
occurred
.
epa
is
preparing
a
delegation
of
authority
to
regional
administrators
to
make
determinations
under
section
182f
)
for
areas
which
are
outside
the
ozone
transport
region
and
which
have
three
years
of
monitoring
data
demonstrating
attainment
.
this
delegation
would
allow
the
rulemaking
for
182f
)
determinations
to
be
conducted
by
epas
regional
offices
.
