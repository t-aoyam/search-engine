while
the
majority
of
the
approximately
11000
wood
furniture
operations
are
small
businesses
,
the
vast
majority
of
the
smaller
operations
would
not
be
directly
affected
by
this
proposed
standard
.
only
approximately
7
percent
of
the
11000
manufacturers
are
expected
to
be
directly
impacted
.
the
estimate
of
7
percent
is
based
on
epas
estimate
of
the
number
of
sources
that
are
major
based
on
actual
emissions
.
it
is
anticipated
that
the
remainder
of
the
industry
will
take
a
federally
enforceable
limit
on
their
emissions
.
as
discussed
under
the
summary
of
impacts
(
section
ivc
of
the
preamble
,
the
economic
analysis
predicted
a
slight
increase
in
wood
furniture
prices
.
therefore
,
the
vast
majority
of
small
manufacturers
,
which
will
not
be
subject
to
the
proposed
rule
may
benefit
from
these
slightly
increased
prices
.
if
these
costs
are
not
offset
by
newer
,
less
expensive
technologies
in
the
future
,
this
benefit
may
be
sustained
.
for
the
smaller
facilities
that
would
be
directly
impacted
by
implementation
of
the
proposed
standards
,
an
analysis
of
the
potential
impact
of
this
proposed
standard
by
plant
size
was
performed
.
the
results
from
this
analysis
indicate
that
implementation
of
this
proposed
rule
would
generally
have
a
small
impact
on
the
net
revenues
of
facilities
of
all
size
groups
and
that
smaller
plants
would
not
be
systematically
impacted
more
severely
than
larger
operations
.
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
5
usc
.
605b
,
i
hereby
certify
that
this
proposed
rule
,
if
promulgated
,
will
not
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
business
entities
.
