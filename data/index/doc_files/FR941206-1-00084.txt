if
,
for
example
,
an
entire
plant
is
designated
as
the
affected
source
,
the
new
source
mact
would
cover
no
part
of
the
plant
unless
replacement
of
equipment
or
a
group
of
equipment
causes
the
entire
plant
to
be
reconstructed
.
on
the
other
hand
,
if
each
individual
piece
of
equipment
(
eg
,
each
spray
booth
)
is
designated
as
an
affected
source
,
then
that
individual
piece
of
equipment
can
be
subject
to
the
reconstruction
provisions
.
a
narrow
definition
of
source
,
such
as
this
one
,
results
in
new
source
mact
applying
to
each
piece
of
new
equipment
.

.
modification
considerations
according
to
section
112a5
,
modification
means
any
physical
change
in
,
or
change
in
the
method
of
operation
of
,
a
major
source
that
increases
the
actual
emissions
of
any
hap
emitted
by
such
source
by
more
than
a
de
minimis
amount
or
that
results
in
the
emission
of
any
hap
not
previously
emitted
by
more
than
a
de
minimis
amount
.
subpart
b
of
part
63
addresses
modifications
and
identifies
the
de
minimis
quantities
for
each
hap
that
would
trigger
the
modification
provisions
.
subpart
b
requires
modified
major
sources
to
implement
the
mact
emission
limit
for
existing
sources
established
pursuant
to
section
112d
.
if
a
mact
rule
for
an
affected
major
source
has
not
been
promulgated
,
existing
source
mact
is
established
on
a
casebycase
case
by
case
basis
.
for
this
source
category
,
the
modification
provisions
are
not
a
primary
consideration
in
selecting
the
affected
source
designation
.
modifications
of
existing
sources
would
mean
that
the
existing
source
mact
standards
continue
to
apply
.
the
only
modification
that
would
occur
in
this
industry
that
would
affect
a
sources
control
requirements
would
be
one
that
causes
an
area
source
to
become
a
major
source
.
if
an
area
source
becomes
major
due
to
a
modification
,
it
is
subject
to
existing
source
mact
.
if
an
area
source
becomes
major
due
to
a
reconstruction
,
it
is
subject
to
new
source
mact
.
the
affected
source
definition
,
however
,
has
no
effect
on
the
major
source
designation
because
that
designation
is
based
on
emissions
from
all
emission
points
located
in
a
contiguous
area
under
common
control
,
even
if
the
affected
source
is
narrowly
defined
.
3
.
affected
source
definitions
the
committee
did
not
discuss
the
affected
source
definition
for
the
proposed
rule
.
the
agency
,
therefore
,
is
proposing
the
affected
source
definition
that
it
believes
is
consistent
with
the
committees
other
decisions
.
to
determine
the
appropriate
affected
source
definition
,
the
agency
focused
on
the
proposed
standards
for
finishing
operations
as
the
driving
force
for
choosing
an
affected
source
definition
.
the
agency
did
this
because
the
finishing
operation
is
the
primary
emission
source
at
the
majority
of
sources
,
and
the
proposed
mact
standards
differ
depending
on
whether
the
source
is
existing
or
new
.
the
agency
concluded
that
there
are
three
possible
affected
source
definitions
for
finishing
operations
:
each
finishing
step
,
each
finishing
line
,
or
each
facility
.
the
agency
first
considered
the
implications
of
defining
the
source
as
each
finishing
step
.
with
this
affected
source
definition
,
if
a
new
application
station
(
eg
,
a
spray
booth
)
was
added
to
a
finishing
line
,
the
finishing
material
used
in
this
step
would
have
to
meet
the
mact
standards
for
new
sources
.
the
agency
agreed
that
this
was
not
feasible
because
the
proposed
rule
allows
for
averaging
within
and
across
finishing
steps
.
if
a
source
is
subject
to
new
source
mact
for
one
step
and
not
for
others
,
this
step
could
not
be
incorporated
into
the
averaging
and
the
facilitys
flexibility
would
be
limited
.
this
runs
counter
to
the
committees
previous
decision
to
allow
sources
the
maximum
flexibility
possible
in
complying
with
the
proposed
rule
.
the
second
possible
affected
source
definition
would
be
to
define
a
finishing
line
as
the
affected
source
.
new
source
mact
would
apply
if
a
facility
installed
a
new
finishing
line
,
or
if
an
existing
line
was
reconstructed
,
as
reconstruction
is
defined
in
§
635
.
with
this
affected
source
definition
,
new
source
mact
is
considered
technically
feasible
by
the
agency
because
all
of
the
finishing
materials
applied
would
have
to
meet
the
same
hap
limit
.
the
same
problems
with
averaging
arise
,
however
,
as
arise
if
a
finishing
step
is
the
affected
source
.
for
example
,
if
a
facility
operates
multiple
finishing
lines
,
including
one
that
is
subject
to
new
source
mact
,
the
new
line
could
not
be
included
in
the
averaging
calculation
because
the
hap
limit
that
applies
to
it
is
different
than
the
limit
that
applies
to
the
other
lines
.
because
this
limits
a
facilitys
flexibility
,
the
agency
did
not
select
the
finishing
line
as
the
affected
source
.
also
,
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
define
the
finishing
line
within
a
plant
.
for
example
,
an
owner
or
operator
may
add
or
remove
pieces
to
or
from
a
finishing
line
at
any
stage
of
the
finishing
.
for
all
of
these
reasons
,
the
agency
,
by
default
,
chose
the
entire
facility
to
be
the
affected
source
.
