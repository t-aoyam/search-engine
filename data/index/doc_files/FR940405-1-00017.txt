sba
also
has
been
making
physical
injury
disaster
loans
to
media
concerns
and
academic
schools
since
1953
,
based
on
humanitarian
grounds
.
the
disaster
loan
program
attempts
to
restore
to
an
injured
party
that
which
was
lost
due
to
circumstances
beyond
its
control
.
no
distinction
is
made
for
eligibility
purposes
between
media
and
nonmedia
media
concerns
for
physical
disaster
loans
,
but
economic
injury
disaster
loans
are
subject
to
the
limitations
of
the
media
policy
rule
.
sba
believes
that
the
assistance
it
presently
makes
available
under
the
exceptions
to
the
media
rule
and
under
the
sbic
and
disaster
programs
are
not
sufficient
to
assist
small
businesses
in
the
media
industries
which
are
demonstrably
in
need
of
increased
aid
.
accordingly
,
sba
is
proposing
to
change
its
policy
so
as
to
make
assistance
available
,
under
the
7a
)
business
,
economic
injury
disaster
and
development
company
loan
programs
,
to
media
concerns
which
are
otherwise
eligible
for
such
assistance
.
while
sba
is
proposing
to
repeal
the
present
rule
primarily
in
order
to
make
assistance
available
to
a
larger
universe
of
small
businesses
,
it
is
not
unmindful
of
the
implications
of
a
total
reversal
of
the
policy
.
it
has
considered
whether
the
policy
determinations
which
where
the
underpinnings
of
the
former
rule
should
be
maintained
.
after
careful
review
,
sba
is
persuaded
that
repeal
is
appropriate
.
a
revision
of
the
present
rule
which
would
attempt
to
differentiate
among
media
businesses
on
the
basis
of
business
activity
likely
would
be
challenged
in
court
.
there
is
a
risk
that
such
proposed
revision
would
be
found
unconstitutional
.
keeping
the
government
from
becoming
involved
with
controversial
speech
may
be
a
worthy
goal
,
but
it
arguably
puts
the
government
in
the
position
of
allocating
benefits
with
reference
to
the
content
of
speech
.
this
type
of
decision
could
be
held
by
courts
to
be
in
conflict
with
the
first
amendment
.
sba
believes
that
it
present
regulatory
apparatus
and
administrative
practice
are
sufficient
to
protect
the
public
interest
.
in
this
regard
,
the
present
credit
criteria
under
which
applications
for
such
assistance
are
reviewed
and
the
prohibition
on
funding
illegal
activities
should
be
sufficient
to
provide
the
desired
level
of
protection
.
