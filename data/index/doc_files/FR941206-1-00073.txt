after
much
discussion
,
the
committee
agreed
upon
an
approach
that
satisfied
all
members
.
under
this
approach
,
all
affected
sources
must
prepare
a
formulation
assessment
plan
.
the
formulation
assessment
plan
will
help
ensure
that
the
averaging
approach
allowed
under
the
proposed
rule
does
not
circumvent
the
goals
of
state
air
toxics
programs
.
the
plan
must
identify
all
vhap
of
potential
concern
being
used
by
the
affected
source
for
finishing
operations
that
are
on
the
list
of
10
compounds
identified
by
industry
.
the
list
,
presented
in
table
4
,
§
63
803
,
of
the
proposed
standards
,
includes
those
vhap
of
potential
concern
that
industry
indicated
were
currently
in
use
by
the
wood
furniture
manufacturing
industry
.
the
plan
must
establish
a
baseline
level
of
usage
,
based
on
the
highest
annual
usage
from
1994
,
1995
,
or
1996
,
for
each
vhap
of
potential
concern
used
by
the
affected
source
.
for
sources
using
formaldehyde
,
the
baseline
level
of
usage
would
be
based
on
the
free
formaldehyde
content
of
the
finishing
material
.
for
styrene
,
the
baseline
level
of
usage
would
be
based
on
an
estimate
of
unreacted
styrene
,
which
would
be
calculated
by
multiplying
the
amount
of
styrene
monomer
in
the
coating
by
a
factor
of
0
16
.
the
free
formaldehyde
content
of
the
finishing
material
was
chosen
as
a
method
for
tracking
formaldehyde
usage
because
it
is
a
readily
available
quantity
based
on
known
and
agreed
upon
industry
test
procedures
.
however
,
there
is
no
data
available
that
directly
links
the
free
formaldehyde
content
of
a
coating
to
formaldehyde
emissions
.
therefore
,
the
committee
recommended
that
if
data
become
available
that
indicated
that
formaldehyde
emissions
were
either
more
or
less
than
those
estimated
using
the
free
formaldehyde
content
,
the
calculation
procedure
in
the
formulation
assessment
plan
should
be
reexamined
examined
.
both
ultraviolet
(
uv
)
and
polyester
coatings
used
by
the
wood
furniture
industry
contain
styrene
monomer
.
during
curing
,
styrene
monomer
reacts
to
form
the
dried
coating
.
however
,
some
of
the
styrene
monomer
is
emitted
during
the
application
of
the
coating
and
as
the
coating
cures
.
while
epa
has
not
developed
an
emission
factor
for
styrene
for
these
coatings
,
they
have
developed
emission
factors
for
the
fabrication
of
products
from
polyester
resins
.
these
emission
factors
are
presented
in
chapter
4
of
epas
`
compilation
of
air
pollutant
emission
factors
'
the
industry
felt
that
the
emission
factors
developed
for
vaporsuppressed
vapor
suppressed
gelcoats
were
appropriate
for
use
in
estimating
unreacted
styrene
monomer
emissions
from
uv
and
polyester
coatings
.
the
emission
factor
for
vaporsuppressed
vapor
suppressed
gelcoats
ranges
from
8
to
25
.
the
industry
and
epa
agreed
to
use
a
midpoint
value
of
16
.
while
a
constant
emission
factor
may
not
be
a
true
measure
of
actual
emissions
,
it
would
not
adversely
affect
the
facility
using
these
coatings
because
both
baseline
emissions
and
emissions
from
later
years
would
be
estimated
on
the
same
basis
.
the
source
must
track
usage
of
each
vhap
of
potential
concern
.
if
,
after
11/19/1998
,
usage
of
the
vhap
of
potential
concern
exceeds
the
established
baseline
levels
then
the
source
must
provide
a
written
notification
to
the
permitting
authority
that
describes
the
amount
of
increase
and
explains
the
reasons
for
exceedance
of
the
baseline
level
.
as
long
as
the
source
is
complying
with
its
state
air
toxics
program
or
any
other
state
rules
or
requirements
affecting
that
vhap
of
potential
concern
,
any
of
the
following
explanations
would
relieve
the
facility
from
further
action
:
(
1
)
the
usage
level
is
below
the
de
minimis
level
,
based
on
70
year
exposure
levels
,
that
is
specified
through
epas
rulemaking
pursuant
to
section
112g
)
of
the
clean
air
act
for
that
vhap
(
for
sources
using
control
devices
to
reduce
emissions
the
usage
level
can
be
adjusted
to
account
for
the
overall
control
efficiency
of
the
control
system
;
(
2
)
the
increase
is
no
more
than
15
percent
above
the
baseline
level
;
(
3
)
the
source
is
in
compliance
with
its
state
air
toxics
regulations
or
guidelines
for
that
vhap
of
potential
concern
;
or
(
4
)
the
vhap
is
used
in
a
finishing
material
that
has
a
voc
content
of
no
more
than
1
kg
voc
kg
solids
(
1
lb
voc
lb
solids
,
as
applied
.
if
the
explanation
for
the
exceedance
of
the
baseline
level
is
not
one
of
the
four
discussed
above
,
the
owner
or
operator
must
confer
with
the
permitting
authority
to
discuss
the
reasons
for
the
increase
and
to
determine
if
these
are
practical
and
reasonable
technologybased
technology
based
solutions
for
reducing
usage
of
the
vhap
.
the
evaluation
of
whether
a
technology
is
reasonable
and
practical
would
be
based
on
cost
,
quality
,
and
marketability
of
the
product
;
the
successful
use
of
the
technology
by
other
wood
furniture
manufacturing
operations
,
or
other
criteria
agreed
upon
by
the
permitting
authority
and
owner
or
operator
.
if
the
permitting
authority
and
owner
or
operator
agree
there
are
no
practical
and
reasonable
solutions
,
the
facility
would
take
no
further
action
.
