issued
a

triggered

clarify

osha
would

cutoffs
for

were
:

many
participants
agreed
that
using
only
the
duration

and
size
of

did
not
adequately
characterize
risk

some
argued
that
all

were
risky

indeed
there
should
be
little
regulatory
distinction
made

,
niosh

richard

,
expressed
the
view
that
`
even
with

smallterm
small

jobs
we
still
feel
that
there
is
a
risk
to
the
worker
,
not
only
from
the
one
time
exposures
,
but
from
the
potential
of
that
worker
doing
multiple
jobs
over
periods
of
time
*
*
*
*
*
*
which
increase
the
exposure
each
time
and
the
lung
burden
of
asbestos
to
each
of
those
exposures

*
*

we
still
feel
that
