however
,
when
has
contract

they
are
still
required
to

and
be

in
recognition
of
the
difficulty
some
has
may
have
in
conversion
to

,
the
rule
will
permit

cost
housing
agencies
may
be
concerned
about

the
costs
of

however

automating
this

also
is
an
allowable
expense
under

the

ultimately
,
the
cost
of
automating
this

will
be
recovered
in
reduced

.
the
department
anticipates
that
the
large
number
of
vendors
competing
in
the
marketplace
will
cause
the
cost
of
automation

electronic

to
be
reasonable

be

the
necessary
