expressed
a
general
opinion
on
the
adequacy

products
,
175
were
supportive
.
some
commenter
stated
that
the
regulations
have
effectively
controlled
the
use
of
product
produced
by
mechanically
deboning
over
many
years
with
a
wide
base
of
consumer
acceptance
,
that
such
product
is
not
significantly
different
from
product
produced
by
hand
deboning
,
that
these
regulations
provide
truthful
labeling
,
and
or
that
the
report
and
scientific
literature
support
the
adequacy
of
current
regulations
.
other
commenters
indicated
that
mechanically
deboned
poultry
should
be
regulated
the

as

the

issued
a
report
recommending
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
direct
the
administrator
of

to
establish
specific
standards
on
poultry
products
produced
by

improvements
in
machinery
for
the
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
the
agency
has
monitored
the
advances
in
the
technology
for
mechanically
deboning
poultry
products
over
the
last
decade
.
there
have
been
improvements
in
the
efficiency
of
the
mechanical
separation
and
removal
of
most
of
the
bone
from
attached
skeletal
muscle
and
tissue
of
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
poultry
carcasses
.
today
,
it
has
been
estimated
that
roughly
700
million
pounds
of
raw
poultry
materials
are
used
to
manufacture
mechanically
deboned
poultry
which
is
used
,
in
turn
,
to
formulate
approximately
400
million
pounds
of
poultry
sausages
(
including
franks
,
bologna
,
and
salami
,
and
300
million
pounds
of
poultry
nuggets
and
poultry
patties
.
there
have
been
major
advances
in
mechanical
deboning
machinery
in
terms
of
the
effectiveness
of
bone
removal
from
skeletal
muscle
and
other
tissues
of
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
.
this
has
been
accomplished
through
enhancements
and
modifications
of
the
boneremoval
bone
removal
devices
that
are
part
of
the
traditional
mechanical
deboning
machines
.
there
have
been
continued
refinements
of
certain
operational
parameters
of
the
machinery
,
eg
,
the
ability
for
operators
to
adjust
the
pressure
needed
to
force
ground
poultry
bones
with
adhering
muscle
and
other
tissues
through
screens
to
separate
muscle
and
other
tissues
from
bone
,
and
the
size
of
the
apertures
(
ie
,
holes
)
in
the
screens
and
sieves
through
which
the
ground
bones
,
muscle
,
and
other
tissues
are
pushed
.
these
improvements
have
resulted
in
the
ability
to
decrease
the
bone
solids
that
are
a
result
of
the
mechanical
deboning
process
for
poultry
to
less
than
the
one
percent
reflected
in
the
current
poultry
products
regulations
