petitioners
argue
that
the
exhibits
to
the
cost
verification
report
demonstrate
that
an
exchange
rate
gain
claimed
by
kt
as
an
offset
to
foreign
exchange
losses
does
not
relate
to
the
merchandise
under
investigation
and
,
accordingly
,
should
not
be
included
in
kts
submitted
cost
of
manufacturing
.

we
agree

accordingly

we
have
not
allowed

:
petitioners
contend
that
the
department
cannot
rely
on
kts
second
cost
submission
because
it
contains
unverified
data
.
thus
,
petitioners
maintain
that
the
departments
conclusion
in
the
cost
verification
report
that
material
costs
in
the
first
submission
are
lower
than
material
costs
reported
in
the
second
cost
submission
does
not
,
and
should
not
,
lend
any
credibility
to
the
data
in
the
first
submission
.
according
to
petitioners
,
both
submissions
are
flawed
and
should
be
rejected
in
their
entirety
.
doc
position
:
we
agree
with
petitioners
that
the
material
cost
data
contained
in
kts
second
submission
was
not
verified
and
should
not
be
relied
upon
by
the
department
.
therefore
,
no
conclusions
were
drawn
as
a
result
of
comparing
material
costs
contained
in
both
the
first
and
second
submissions
.

kt
argues
that
the
department
should
accept
its
reported
value
for
work
in
process
.
kt
asserts
that
,
although
its
opening
and
closing
work
in
process
for
the
poi
are
valued
at
standard
cost
,
without
any
adjustment
for
the
variance
during
the
period
,
it
is
mathematically
impossible
for
this
to
result
in
an
understatement
of
kts
costs
because
kt
had
a
negative
variance
for
fy
1993
.
doc
position
:
we
agree
.
since
kt
had
a
negative
variance
during
the
relevant
periods
,
the
effect
of
valuing
workinprocess
work
in
process
at
standard
cost
would
be
to
overstate
its
costs
.
therefore
,
no
adjustment
is
deemed
necessary
.
