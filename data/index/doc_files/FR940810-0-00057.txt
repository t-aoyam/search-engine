that

because
the
manner

similar

the

the
rulemaking
process
revealed
that
there
was
confusion
in
the
shipyard
industry
sector
as
to
which
of
the
standards
applied
to
the
various
activities
within
the
shipyard
.
in
his
testimony
,
the
chairman
of
the
shipyard
employment
standards
committee
said
:
`
in
the
case
of
asbestos
,
both
1910
and
1926
are
both
applied
in
various
shipyard
operations
.
this
is
confusing
to
the
shipyard
work
force
who
are
required
to
follow
one
set
of
rules
one
day
and
another
set
the
next
day
'
(

)
in
the
current
revision
of
the
asbestos
standards
,
osha
has
determined
that
a
separate
vertical
standard
for
shipyards
is
appropriate
.
osha
understands
that
many
spokespeople
for
the
shipyard
industry
believe
that
compliance
with
oshas
asbestos
standards
will
be
facilitated
in
shipyards
if
only
one
standard
applies
to
those
workplaces
.
because
osha
wishes
to
promote
compliance
,
and
because
the
agency
acknowledges
that
some
shipyard
conditions
are
unique
,
osha
is
issuing
a
standard
that
will
apply
only
to
shipyard
industries
.
it
is
neither
less
nor
more
rigorous
than
the
general
industry
and
construction
standards
.
how
it
differs
from
the
two
other
asbestos
standards
will
be
discussed
under
the
topic
heading
for
each
substantive
provision
,
in
the
preamble

which
follows

the
recommendations
will
be
discussed
more
fully
,
following
a
summary
of
the
relatively
small
number
of
comments
received
by
the
agency
.
most
provisions
in
the
final
shipyard
standard
include
some
relevant
provisions
similar
to
the
revised
construction
standard
.
in
addition
osha
has
incorporated
some
of
the
specific
recommendations
made
by
the
shipyards

committee
discussed
below

alphabetically
,
the
changes
are
as
follows
:
the
1986
standards
contained
an
`
action
level
'
of
01
f
cc
,
one
half
the
pel
of
02
f
cc
.
the
action
level
provides
a
`
trigger
'
for
certain
duties
,
such
as
monitoring
,
medical
surveillance
and
training
.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
instructed
osha
to
consider
reducing
the
action
level
to
0
05
f
cc
should
the
pel
be
reduced
to
01
f
cc
.
in
most
singlesubstance
single
substance
air
contaminant
standards
it
has
issued
,
osha
has
set
an
action
level
equal
to
half
the
pel
.
the
action
level
triggers
duties
of
monitoring
,
medical
surveillance
,
and
training
,
and
assures
that
workers
who
are
not
exposed
at
or
above
the
pel
but
who
may
nevertheless
be
exposed
to
levels
that
present
a
risk
to
their
health
receive
a
degree
of
protection
.
the
action
level
thus
helps
to
reduce
residual
risk
that
may
remain
at
the
pel
.
in
these
standards
,
osha
has
taken
a
different
approach
to
protecting
workers
exposed
to
levels
of
asbestos
below
the
pel
.
instead
of
a
numerical
action
level
,
employer
duties
involving
training
and
medical
surveillance
are
triggered
by
exposure
to
acm
or
pacm
or
by
the
type
of
work
being
done
.
additionally
,
work
practices
also
are
required
regardless
of
measured
exposure
levels
.
osha
considers
this
approach
to
better
protect
employees
than
an
action
level
,
which
triggers
training
and
medical
surveillance
duties
based
on
monitoring
results
.
oshas
approach
is
particularly
appropriate
for
asbestos
because
in
many
cases
,
asbestos
levels
below
the
pel
cannot
be
reliably
measured
,
and
duties
tied
to
an
action
level
might
therefore
be
triggered
by
measurements
of
dubious
accuracy
.
