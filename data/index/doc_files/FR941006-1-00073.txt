further
streamlining

it
takes
to
audit
publicly

to
make

the
commission
has
taken
several
actions
to
help
insure
that
the
audit
and
repayment
processes
are
completed
as
expeditiously
as
possible
.
for
example
,
the
1991
revisions

eased
compliance
with
the

state
by
state
allocation
rules

in
addition
,
as
noted
above
,
the
commission
has
begun
to
use
generally
accepted
sampling
procedures
in
conducting
these
audits
,
and
has
instituted
a
policy
that
limits
a
committee
to
one
extension
of
time
in
which
to
respond
to
the
interim
and
final
audit
reports
[

'
and
`
far
.
these
actions
are
having
the
desired
effect
,
in
that
the
commission
is
currently
on
schedule
,
or
ahead
of
schedule
,
with
respect
to
nearly
all

audits
