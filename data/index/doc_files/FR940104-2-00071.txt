in
response
to
todays
competitive
market
environment
,
the
pse
has
proposed
to
codify
its
policy
that
members
should
make
their
best
efforts
not
to
interfere
in
another
members
cross
transaction
and
,
in
particular
,
that
the
specialist
should
not
participate
unless
he
or
she
is
liquidating
a
position
.
the
pse
also
has
proposed
to
add
a
new
requirement
,
based
on
a
comparable
rule
on
the
phlx
,
that
the
specialists
proprietary
bid
or
offer
yield
to
the
customer
side
of
a
cross
transaction
at
the
cross
price
.
17
looking
at
the
proposal
as
whole
,
the
commission
believes
that
it
will
clarify
the
roles
of
various
market
participants
and
assure
that
,
under
routine
circumstances
,
crosses
are
executed
in
a
fair
and
orderly
manner
.
in
sum
,
the
commission
finds
that
this
proposed
rule
change
should
improve
the
pses
ability
to
compete
for
block
business
and
should
enhance
the
depth
and
liquidity
of
the
exchange
market
.

as
noted
above
,
this
part
of
the
pse
proposal
is
based
on
recent
amendments
to
phlx
rule
126
.
see
supra
,
note
16
.
briefly
,
the
phlx
requires
that
a
members
proprietary
bid
or
offer
yield
to
the
customer
side
of
a
cross
transaction
at
the
cross
price
.
in
approving
the
phlx
proposal
,
the
commission
took
note
of
the
fact
that
most
principal
trading
activity
on
the
floor
of
that
regional
stock
exchange
,
other
than
facilitation
crosses
,
is
undertaken
by
the
specialist
.

the
commission
appreciates
all
the
exchanges
'
competitive
concerns
with
respect
to
the
facilitation
of
cross
transactions
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
continues
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
adherence
with
traditional
auction
market
principles
.
<
footnote
>
in
terms
of
auction
market
principles
,
the
commission
believes
that
the
proposed
rule
change
strikes
an
appropriate
balance
between
the
competing
needs
of
various
customer
orders
represented
for
execution
on
the
pse
and
the
proprietary
trading
operations
of
exchange
members
and
member
organizations
,
including
specialists
.
the
commission
notes
that
rule
5
14
)
will
continue
to
require
that
a
member
effecting
a
cross
transaction
first
assure
that
all
existing
bids
or
offers
on
the
specialists
book
or
represented
in
the
trading
crowd
,
at
or
better
than
the
cross
price
,
are
filled
at
their
limits
.
19
on
that
basis
,
the
commission
has
concluded
that
the
pse
proposal
adheres
to
the
auction
market
principles
of
time
and
price
priority
and
that
this
method
for
the
execution
of
crosses
(
and
,
in
particular
,
the
priority
granted
to
the
customer
side
of
the
transaction
)
will
not
disadvantage
existing
orders
.
20
in
fact
,
limit
orders
on
the
pse
which
coincide
with
the
cross
price
could
benefit
from
being
assured
of
receiving
an
execution
at
that
price
.

in
this
regard
,
the
pse
proposal
contrasts
favorably
with
other
rule
changes
approved
by
the
commission
,
such
as
the
nyses
clean
cross
proposal
,
see
supra
note
16
.
<
footnote

furthermore
,
the
commission
finds
that
the
pse
proposal
does
not
restrict
the
opportunity
for
customer
orders
to
receive
price
improvement
.
to
this
end
,
the
commission
interprets
the
proposed
commentary
to
rule
5
14
,
and
the
exchange
agrees
with
that
interpretation
,
21
to
allow
the
specialist
to
participate
in
a
cross
transaction
to
provide
one
side
with
a
better
price
,
notwithstanding
the
other
provisions
of
this
rule
.
22
in
addition
,
under
the
pses
method
,
it
is
possible
for
interest
in
the
trading
crowd
,
including
an
order
for
the
principal
account
of
a
member
,
to
break
up
the
cross
and
to
improve
the
price
.

finally
,
the
commission
believes
that
the
pse
proposal
would
not
grant
priority
,
parity
or
precedence
to
the
order
of
a
member
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
section
11a1g
)
of
the
act
or
sec
rule
11a11ta3
)
thereunder
.
23
for
purposes
of
its
proposed
rule
change
,
the
pse
has
defined
the
term
`
customer
order
'
as
an
order
that
a
broker
represents
in
an
agency
capacity
,
including
a
professional
order
that
is
not
for
an
account
associated
with
the
executing
broker
.
because
this
definition
of
`
customer
order
'
excludes
(
and
,
thus
,
does
not
grant
priority
to
)
an
order
for
an
account
over
which
the
broker
or
an
associated
person
of
the
broker
exercises
investment
discretion
,
the
commission
is
satisfied
that
the
proposed
rule
change
complies
with
section
11a
.
