the
revised
regulations
adopted

provide
that
operators
may
adjust
their
rates
after

operators
electing

make
rate
adjustments
under
this
rule
at
any
time
during
the
threeyear

year
period
beginning

operators
may
use
any
portion

the
operators
cap
to
recover
license
fees
associated
with

to

in

operators
may
recover
an
additional
amount
of
not
more
than
30
cents
per
subscriber
per
month
for
license
fees
associated
with
adding

channels
during

years
the
operators
cap
is
in
effect
.
in
the
third
year

rules

will
be
subject
to
the
general

rules

c
.
in
addition
,
the
commission
determined
that
operators
electing
to
use
the
20
cent
per
channel
adjustment
may
not
take
the
75
%
markup
mark
on
programming
cost
increases
,
including
retransmission
consent
fees
and
copyright
fees
incurred
for
carriage
of
broadcast
signals
,
for
channels
added
on
or
after
05/15/1994
.
the
commission
made
this
determination
because
its
analysis
indicates
that
the
20
cent
per
channel
adjustment
will
provide
full
and
fair
compensation
to
operators
adding
new
channels
to
cpsts
.
discussion
d
.
the
commission
believes
that
for
operators
using
the
per
channel
adjustment
of
up
to
20
cents
,
maintaining
the
75
%
markup
mark
on
programming
cost
increases
for
channels
offered
before
05/15/1994
,
may
no
longer
be
necessary
given
the
total
incentive
structure
provided
in
the
revised
going
forward
rules
.
in
addition
,
the
75
%
markup
mark
on
such
channels
may
create
an
artificial
incentive
for
the
operator
to
continue
to
offer
programming
that
the
operator
would
not
otherwise
continue
to
offer
.
for
these
reasons
,
the
commission
tentatively
concludes
that
the
75
%
markup
mark
is
unnecessary
for
such
operators
with
respect
to
increases
in
programming
costs
for
channels
offered
before
05/15/1994
.
the
commission
solicits
comment
on
whether
operators
electing
to
use
the
per
channel
adjustment
of
up
to
20
cents
under
the
new
rules
should
be
allowed
to
take
the
75
%
markup
mark
on
increases
in
programming
costs
,
including
retransmission
consent
fees
and
copyright
fees
incurred
for
carriage
of
broadcast
signals
,
for
channels
added
before
05/15/1994
.
if
the
commission
decides
that
such
operators
may
not
take
a
75
%
markup
mark
on
increases
in
programming
costs
,
it
will
not
consider
requiring
cable
operators
to
prospectively
remove
from
rates
any
75
%
markup
mark
added
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
a
final
rule
on
this
issue
.
e
.
the
commission
believes
that
the
75
%
markup
mark
on
new
programming
costs
when
channels
are
initially
added
to
a
system
ought
be
preserved
for
systems
that
continue
to
use
the
existing
going
forward
rules
because
the
75
%
markup
mark
is
an
important
part
of
the
total
package
of
incentives
to
add
new
programming
under
the
existing
rules
.
the
commissions
rules
permitting
operators
to
pass
through
external
costs
are
generally
intended
to
compensate
for
added
costs
outside
the
operators
'
control
and
not
to
provide
an
additional
markup
mark
without
a
clear
policy
purpose
.
in
contrast
to
the
situation
where
the
goal
of
providing
incentives
to
add
new
programming
services
justifies
a
markup
mark
,
there
appears
to
be
no
strong
reason
to
allow
a
markup
mark
programming
cost
increases
for
a
service
already
being
offered
.
the
commission
therefore
solicits
comment
on
whether
operators
electing
to
use
the
current
going
forward
rules
should
be
permitted
to
passthrough
pass
through
the
75
%
markup
mark
on
programming
cost
increases
after
the
initial
markup
mark
on
the
programming
cost
of
new
channels
.
the
commission
will
not
,
however
,
consider
prospectively
removing
from
rates
any
75
%
markup
mark
that
was
reflected
in
rates
prior
to
our
reaching
a
decision
on
this
issue
.
