the
information
proposed
to
be
provided
under
this
subparagraph
need
not
be
conveyed
to

through

informing

can
be
accomplished
,
for
example
,
through
written
means
such
as
fact
sheets
,

,
or
posted

osha
will
provide
in
a
nonmandatory
mandatory
appendix
to
the
final
rule
an
example
illustrating
what
information
is
to
be
provided
to
employees
.
paragraph
(
g3
)
proposes
to
require
that
the
employer
make
training
materials
developed
under
these
provisions
,
including
the
standard
and
its
appendices
,
available
for
inspection
and
copying
by
employees
,
designated
employee
representatives
,
the
director
,
and
the
assistant
secretary
.
training
and
information
requirements
are
routine
components
of
osha
health
standards
.
the
inclusion
of
training
and
information
requirements
reflects
the
agencys
conviction
,
as
noted
above
,
that
informed
employees
are
essential
to
the
operation
of
any
effective
health
program
.
osha
believes
that
informing
and
training
employees
about
the
hazards
to
which
they
are
exposed
will
contribute
substantially
to
reducing
the
incidence
of
diseases
caused
by
workplace
conditions
.
further
,
as
noted
earlier
,
it
has
been
oshas
experience
that
unacceptable
indoor
air
quality
is
often
the
result
of
deficiencies
in
implementing
effective
hvac
system
operation
and
maintenance
programs
.
the
agency
believes
that
specialized
training
of
workers
performing
those
activities
is
,
therefore
,
necessary
to
ensure
successful
performance
of
their
jobs
.

paragraph
(

proposes
to
require
that
employers
maintain

of
:
all
written
information
regarding
the
iaq
compliance
program
required
to
be
established
under

which
must
include
the
specific
remedial
or
maintenance
actions
taken
,
the
name
and
affiliation
of
the
individual
performing
the
work
,
and
the
date
of
the
inspection
or
maintenance
activity
;
and
records
of

complaints
of

required
to
be
established
under
paragraph
(
c5
)
of
this
section
[

.
paragraph
(

also
proposes
to
require
the
employer
to
retain
these
for
at
least
the
previous
three
years
[

3502
,
except
that
operation
,
maintenance
,
inspection
,
and
compliance
program
records
need
not
be
retained
for
three
years
if
rendered
obsolete
by
the
establishment
and
replacement
of
more
recent
records
,
or
rendered
irrelevant
due
to
hvac
system
replacement
or
redesign
.
the
records
required
to
be
maintained
by
the
employer
are
to
be
made
available
to
employees
and
their
designated
representative
and
the
assistant
secretary
for
examination
and
copying
.
finally
,
paragraph
(
h6
)
proposes
to
require
that
whenever
the
employer
ceases
to
do
business
records
that
are
required
to
be
maintained
by
the
employer
are
to
be
provided

and
retained
by
the
successor
employer

section
8
(
c
)
of
the
act
authorizes
osha
to
require
employers
to
make
,
keep
,
and
preserve
,
and
make
available
to
the
secretary
or
the
director
records
regarding
their
activities
as
prescribed
by
regulation
as
appropriate
and
necessary
for
the
enforcement
of
the
act
or
for
developing
information
regarding
the
causes
and
prevention
of
occupational
illnesses
.
as
noted
earlier
,
the
agency
believes
that
development
of
written
compliance
plans
are
essential
to
implementation
of
a
successful
iaq
program
.
the
written
compliance
program
,
inspection
and
maintenance
records
,
and
operator
and
maintenance
schedules
which
are
required
to
be
established
under
the
proposal
,
are
required
to
be
retained
under
this
paragraph
.
this
information
essentially
documents
the
desired
performance
levels
of
hvac
systems
,
and
the
measures
necessary
to
maintain
those
levels
of
performance
,
as
well
as
other
measures
which
should
be
followed
to
ensure
acceptable
indoor
air
quality
.
such
data
must
be
available
for
use
by
designated
persons
,
current
employers
,
successor
employers
,
and
employees
as
a
blueprint
for
program
implementation
.
without
such
data
,
air
quality
problems
would
likely
arise
due
to
ignorance
of
such
elements
as
design
occupant
densities
,
equipment
schedules
,
maintenance
requirements
and
frequencies
,
etc
.
records
required
to
be
established
in
response
to
employee
complaints
of
buildingrelated
building
related
illness
are
also
required
to
be
retained
under
this
paragraph
.
such
complaints
require
the
employer
to
evaluate
the
need
for
,
and
to
take
if
necessary
,
remedial
action
to
correct
observed
problems
[
ex
.
31
,
3444b
.
information
regarding
employee
illness
is
essential
in
identifying
causal
factors
and
trends
in
adverse
health
effects
.
retention
of
this
health
data
will
aid
in
the
recognition
,
evaluation
and
correction
of
indoor
air
quality
deficiencies
which
lead
to
buildingrelated
building
related
illnesses
.
records
of
buildingrelated
building
related
illness
are
proposed
to
be
required
to
be
retained
for
at
least
the
previous
3
years
.
osha
believes
that
requiring
record
retention
for
3
years
of
buildingrelated
building
related
illnesses
which
occur
in
nonindustrial
environments
is
reasonable
.
such
illnesses
are
not
viewed
in
the
same
context
as
industrial
illnesses
which
may
be
associated
with
long
latency
periods
,
and
thus
necessitate
very
long
retention
periods
for
health
records
.
establishment
and
maintenance
of
buildingrelated
building
related
illness
records
is
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
documenting
indoor
air
quality
degradation
,
so
that
corrective
action
can
be
taken
.
requiring
records
to
be
retained
to
preserve
a
3
year
history
of
buildingrelated
building
related
illness
,
is
proposed
as
being
reasonable
to
aid
in
the
tracking
of
air
quality
trends
and
past
experiences
[
ex
.
3502
.
other
records
are
also
required
to
be
retained
for
at
least
the
previous
3
years
,
except
to
the
extent
they
become
obsolete
.
osha
does
not
believe
that
records
such
as
maintenance
and
operating
schedules
which
become
irrelevant
due
to
hvac
system
modification
or
replacement
need
be
retained
further
.
the
records
required
to
be
retained
under
this
paragraph
must
be
transferred
to
successor
employers
.
since
these
records
contain
information
specific
to
the
building
or
facility
,
as
opposed
to
specific
employers
,
such
records
should
be
maintained
within
affected
buildings
for
future
use
.
dates
:
paragraph
(
i
)
paragraph
(
i
)
proposes
to
establish
an
effective
date
for
this
standard
of
sixty
(
60
)
days
from
publication
in
the
federal
register
.
.
a
startup
start
date
one
year
from
the
effective
date
is
proposed
as
an
adequate
period
of
time
for
employers
to
achieve
full
compliance
with
all
provisions
under
the
rule
.
the
agency
believes
that
affected
employers
can
develop
and
implement
compliance
programs
,
establish
designated
smoking
areas
if
smoking
is
not
prohibited
,
and
train
employees
as
proposed
under
the
standard
within
a
one
year
period
from
the
effective
date
