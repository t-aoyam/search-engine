for

osha

on

.
osha
has
determined
that
the
following
four
industries
in
primary
manufacturing
would
be
affected
by
the
revision
to
the
asbestos
standard
:
sic
3292
,
friction
materials
;
sic
3053
,
gaskets
and
packings
;
sic
2952
,
coatings
and
sealants
;
and
sic
3089
,
plastics
.
osha
has
concluded
that
there
will
be
no
incremental
costs
for
the
secondary
manufacturing
industries
identified
in
the
preliminary
regulatory
impact
analysis
because
these
manufacturers
are
believed
to
have
already
achieved
exposure
reductions
that
bring
them
into
compliance
with

osha
compared
the
incremental
compliance
costs
anticipated
for
the
four
affected
primary
manufacturing
industries
with
three
financial
indicators
:
(
1
)
annual
payroll
per
firm
,
(
2
)
dollar
value
of
sales
per
firm
and
(
3
)
pretax
tax
profits
per
firm
.
the
comparison
with
annual
payroll
conveys
the
magnitude
of
compliance
costs
relative
to
labor
costs
.
the
comparison
with
sales
provides
a
measure
of
the
extent
to
which
prices
would
rise
to
maintain
profit
levels
if
a
firm
is
able
to
pass
100
percent
of
incremental
costs
forward
to
buyers
.
if
firms
,
for
competitive
reasons
,
are
unable
to
pass
costs
forward
and
must
instead
absorb
the
full
impact
internally
,
pretax
tax
profits
would
be
expected
to
fall
.
the
comparison
with
pretax
tax
profits
thus
illustrates
the
maximum
financial
impact
if
the
firm
absorbs
100
percent
of
the
incremental
compliance
costs
.

presents
the
estimated
impact
of
compliance
costs
in
relation
to
annual
payroll
,
sales
,
and
pretax
tax
profits
per
plant
in
primary
manufacturing
.
compliance
costs
as
a
percentage
of
sales
are
modest
,
averaging
06
percent
for
affected
establishments
in
primary
manufacturing
(
column
7
.
however
,
as
shown
in
column
8
in
the
table
,
profit
impacts
are
relatively
high
for
two
sectors
:
friction
materials
(
262
percent
)
and
gaskets
and
packings
(
73
percent
.
for
reasons
given
below
,
osha
believes
that
profit
impacts
will
be
minimized
by
the
ability
of
firms
to
pass
forward
costs
to
consumers
.
the
small
increases
in
product
prices
(
less
than
2
percent
)
necessary
to
cover
the
increased
costs
of
production
would
be
unlikely
to
affect
the
demand
for
these
products
.
