background
iron
is
an
essential
nutrient
that
,
in
certain
circumstances
,
can
be
toxic
.
for
some
women
of
childbearing
child
bearing
age
and
for
some
young
children
,
iron
from
dietary
sources
alone
may
be
insufficient
to
meet
their
metabolic
iron
requirements
.
access
to
products
that
provide
iron
is
useful
for
these
groups
to
ensure
that
their
iron
requirements
are
met
.
however
,
when
consumed
acutely
in
large
quantities
by
young
children
,
iron
is
toxic
and
can
,
in
some
cases
,
lead
to
death
.
since
the
mid
1980s
,
an
upsurge
in
reported
accidental
pediatric
ingestion
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
has
occurred
(
ref1
.
this
fact
,
and
the
many
resultant
injuries
and
deaths
of
children
,
have
created
a
dilemma
with
respect
to
how
to
ensure
that
iron
sources
are
available
while
still
minimizing
the
risks
to
children
.
in
response
,
fda
is
proposing
regulations
that
require
that
a
warning
be
placed
on
labeling
about
the
adverse
effects
of
acute
,
high
dose
iron
ingestion
by
children
and
that
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
be
used
for
certain
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
these
requirements
,
if
adopted
,
will
apply
to
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
in
addition
to
the
existing
requirements
of
cpsc
,
which
provide
that
childresistant
child
resistant
packaging
must
be
used
for
most
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
available
(
see
section
iib
.
of
this
document
.
the
agency
tentatively
finds
that
the
effect
of
these
new
requirements
,
in
conjunction
with
those
of
cpsc
,
will
be
to
significantly
reduce
the
risk
of
accidental
pediatric
iron
poisoning
.
the
types
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
that
have
been
associated
with
poisonings
of
young
children
are
those
offered
in
solid
oral
dosage
form
(
eg
,
capsules
and
tablets
)
as
:
(
1
)
childrens
and
adults
multivitamin/mineral
vitamin/mineral
supplements
that
contain
iron
or
iron
salts
(
these
products
typically
provide
less
than
30
mg
of
iron
per
dosage
unit
,
(
2
)
products
intended
for
use
as
iron
supplements
(
these
products
typically
contain
30
mg
or
more
of
iron
per
dosage
unit
,
and
(

)
drug
products
that
contain
iron
or
iron
salts
(
these
products
typically
contain
30
mg
or
more
of
iron
per
dosage
unit
.
in
this
document
,
the
term
`
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
'
refers
to
all
of
these
types
of
products
.
the
agency
is
not
aware
of
incidents
of
poisoning
being
caused
by
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
in
liquid
or
powder
form
.
therefore
,
these
products
are
not
subject
to
this
proposal
.
the
agency
will
consider
what
regulatory
action
is
appropriate
to
take
with
regard
to
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
in
liquid
or
powder
form
if
it
becomes
aware
of
information
indicating
that
these
products
have
caused
or
can
cause
poisonings
in
children
.
this
document
also
does
not
bear
in
any
way
on
conventional
foods
containing
naturally
occurring
or
added
iron
.
pediatric
iron
poisoning
from
consumption
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
foods
in
conventional
food
form
is
unlikely
because
of
limitations
inherent
in
the
large
quantity
of
food
that
would
have
to
be
ingested
to
cause
an
adverse
effect
in
young
children
.
for
example
,
a
serving
of
a
highly
fortified
breakfast
cereal
that
contains
100
percent
of
the
recommended
daily
intake
for
iron
of
18
mg
,
would
provide
only
7
percent
of
the
amount
of
iron
that
is
considered
necessary
to
produce
symptoms
of
iron
poisoning
in
a
10
kilograms
(
kg
)
(
22
pounds
(

)
child
(
ie
,
25
milligrams
(
mg
)
per
(
)
kg
of
iron
,
which
equates
to
250
mg
total
iron
for
a
10
kg
(
22
lb
)
child
.
(
see
section
ib
.
of
this
document
)
moreover
,
the
agency
is
not
aware
of
any
pediatric
iron
poisonings
that
have
resulted
from
ingestion
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
foods
in
conventional
food
form

the
iron
requirements
of
children
and
women
of
childbearing
age
iron
is
an
essential
nutrient
because
it
is
a
component
of
blood
and
muscle
tissue
and
because
of
its
role
in
metabolic
reactions
.
ironcontaining
iron
containing
compounds
in
the
body
may
be
grouped
into
two
categories
:
(
1
)
those
that
serve
metabolic
functions
,
and
(
2
)
those
associated
with
iron
storage
.
the
compounds
in
the
first
category
include
hemoglobin
(
a
component
of
red
blood
cells
,
myoglobin
(
a
muscle
protein
,
and
ironcontaining
iron
containing
enzymes
.
they
account
for
approximately
80
percent
of
body
iron
.
compounds
in
the
second
category
are
involved
in
the
maintenance
of
iron
homeostasis
and
include
the
storage
compounds
ferritin
and
hemosiderin
.
when
the
supply
of
dietary
iron
becomes
inadequate
to
meet
the
bodys
needs
,
iron
is
mobilized
from
iron
stores
to
maintain
the
production
of
red
blood
cells
and
to
perform
other
essential
irondependent
iron
dependent
functions
.
when
body
iron
stores
are
low
or
depleted
,
as
often
occurs
in
women
of
childbearing
child
bearing
age
and
in
very
young
children
,
a
person
is
vulnerable
to
adverse
effects
associated
with
iron
deficiency
anemia
and
with
a
reduction
in
metabolic
and
body
functions
.
