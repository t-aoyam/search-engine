differential
counting
:
the
term
applied
to
the
practice
of
excluding
certain
kinds
of
fibers
from
the
fiber
count
because
they
do
not
appear
to
be
asbestos
.
fiber
:
a
particle
that
is
5
m
or
longer
,
with
a

ratio
of
3
to

or

.
field
:
the

circle
that
is
superimposed
on
the
microscope
image
.
set
:
the
samples
which
are

,
submitted

,

,

history
early
surveys
to
determine
asbestos
exposures
were
conducted
using
impinger
counts
of
total
dust
with
the
counts
expressed
as
million
particles
per
cubic
foot
.
the
british
asbestos
research
council
recommended
filter
membrane
counting
in
1969
.
in
july
1969
,
the
bureau
of
occupational
safety
and
health
published
a
filter
membrane
method
for
counting
asbestos
fibers
in
the
united
states
.
this
method
was
refined
by
niosh
and
published
as
p
&
amp
;
cam
239
.
on
05/29/1971
,
osha
specified
filter
membrane
sampling
with
phase
contrast
counting
for
evaluation
of
asbestos
exposures
at
work
sites
in
the
united
states
.
the
use
of
this
technique
was
again
required
by
osha
in
1986
.
phase
contrast
microscopy
has
continued
to
be
the
method
of
choice
for
the
measurement
of
occupational
exposure
to
asbestos
.
12
.
principle
air
is
drawn
through
a
mce
filter
to
capture
airborne
asbestos
fibers
.
a
wedge
shaped
portion
of
the
filter
is
removed
,
placed
on
a
glass
microscope
slide
and
made
transparent
.
a
measured
area
(
field
)
is
viewed
by
pcm
.
all
the
fibers
meeting
a
defined
criteria
for
asbestos
are
counted
and
considered
a
measure
of
the
airborne
asbestos
concentration
.
13
.
advantages
and
disadvantages
there
are
four
main
advantages
of
pcm
over
other
methods
:
(
1
)
the
technique
is
specific
for
fibers
.
phase
contrast
is
a
fiber
counting
technique
which
excludes
nonfibrous
fibrous
particles
from
the
analysis
.
(
2
)
the
technique
is
inexpensive
and
does
not
require
specialized
knowledge
to
carry
out
the
analysis
for
total
fiber
counts
.
(
3
)
the
analysis
is
quick
and
can
be
performed
onsite
on
site
for
rapid
determination
of
air
concentrations
of
asbestos
fibers
.
(
4
)
the
technique
has
continuity
with
historical
epidemiological
studies
so
that
estimates
of
expected
disease
can
be
inferred
from
longterm
long
term
determinations
of
asbestos
exposures
.
the
main
disadvantage
of
pcm
is
that
it
does
not
positively
identify
asbestos
fibers
.
other
fibers
which
are
not
asbestos
may
be
included
in
the
count
unless
differential
counting
is
performed
.
this
requires
a
great
deal
of
experience
to
adequately
differentiate
asbestos
from
nonasbestos
asbestos
fibers
.
positive
identification
of
asbestos
must
be
performed
by
polarized
light
or
electron
microscopy
techniques
.
a
further
disadvantage
of
pcm
is
that
the
smallest
visible
fibers
are
about
02
&
mum
in
diameter
while
the
finest
asbestos
fibers
may
be
as
small
as
0
02
&
mum
in
diameter
.
for
some
exposures
,
substantially
more
fibers
may
be
present
than
are
actually
counted
.

.
workplace
exposure
asbestos
is
used
by
the
construction
industry
in
such
products
as
shingles
,
floor
tiles
,
asbestos
cement
,
roofing
felts
,
insulation
and
acoustical
products
.
nonconstruction
non
construction
uses
include
brakes
,
clutch
facings
,
paper
,
paints
,
plastics
,
and
fabrics
.
one
of
the
most
significant
exposures
in
the
workplace
is
the
removal
and
encapsulation
of
asbestos
in
schools
,
public
buildings
,
and
homes
.
many
workers
have
the
potential
to
be
exposed
to
asbestos
during
these
operations
.
about
95
%
of
the
asbestos
in
commercial
use
in
the
united
states
is
chrysotile
.
crocidolite
and
amosite
make
up
most
of
the
remainder
.
anthophyllite
and
tremolite
or
actinolite
are
likely
to
be
encountered
as
contaminants
in
various
industrial
products
.
15
.
physical
properties
asbestos
fiber
possesses
a
high
tensile
strength
along
its
axis
,
is
chemically
inert
,
noncombustible
combustible
,
and
heat
resistant
.
it
has
a
high
electrical
resistance
and
good
sound
absorbing
properties
.
it
can
be
weaved
into
cables
,
fabrics
or
other
textiles
,
and
also
matted
into
asbestos
papers
,
felts
,
or
mats
.
