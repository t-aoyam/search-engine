act
of

law

11
(
1991
,
directed
the
secretary
to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
the
national
academy
of
sciences
(
nas
)
to
review
the
scientific
evidence
concerning
the
association
between
exposure
to
herbicides
used
in
support
of
military
operations
in
the
republic
of
vietnam
during
the
vietnam
era
and
each
disease
suspected
to
be
associated
with
such
exposure
.
congress
mandated
that
nas
determine
,
to
the
extent
possible
,
(
1
)
whether
there
is
a
statistical
association
between
the
suspect
diseases
and
herbicide
exposure
,
taking
into
account
the
strength
of
the
scientific
evidence
and
the
appropriateness
of
the
methods
used
to
detect
the
association
;
(

)
the
increased
risk
of
disease
among
individuals
exposed
to
herbicides
during
service
in
the
republic
of
vietnam
during
the
vietnam
era
;
and
(

)
whether
there
is
a
plausible
biological
mechanism
or
other
evidence
of
a
causal
relationship
between
herbicide
exposure
and
the
suspect
disease
.
section
2
of
public
law
1024
provides
that
whenever
the
secretary
determines
,
based
on
sound
medical
and
scientific
evidence
,
that
a
positive
association
(
ie
,
the
credible
evidence
for
the
association
is
equal
to
or
outweighs
the
credible
evidence
against
the
association
)
exists
between
exposure
of
humans
to
an
herbicide
agent
(
ie
,
a
chemical
in
an
herbicide
used
in
support
of
the
united
states
and
allied
military
operations
in
the
republic
of
vietnam
during
the
vietnam
era
)
and
a
disease
,
the
secretary
will
publish
regulations
establishing
presumptive
service
connection
for
that
disease
.
if
the
secretary
determines
that
a
presumption
of
service
connection
is
not
warranted
,
he
will
publish
a
notice
of
that
determination
,
which
includes
an
explanation
of
the
scientific
basis
for
that
determination
.
although
public
law
1024
does
not
define
`
credible
,
it
does
instruct
the
secretary
to
`
take
into
consideration
whether
the
results
are
statistically
significant
,
are
capable
of
replication
,
and
withstand
peer
review
'
simply
comparing
the
number
of
studies
which
report
a
positive
relative
risk
to
the
number
of
studies
which
report
a
negative
relative
risk
for
a
particular
condition
is
not
a
valid
method
for
determining
whether
the
weight
of
evidence
overall
supports
a
finding
that
there
is
or
is
not
a
positive
association
between
herbicide
exposure
and
the
subsequent
development
of
the
particular
condition
.
because
of
differences
in
statistical
significance
,
confidence
levels
,
control
for
confounding
factors
,
etc
,
some
studies
are
clearly
more
credible
than
others
,
and
the
secretary
has
given
them
more
weight
in
evaluating
the
overall
credibility
of
the
evidence
concerning
specific
diseases
.
after
reviewing
approximately
6420
abstracts
of
scientific
or
medical
articles
and
selecting
approximately
230
epidemiologic
studies
for
detailed
analysis
,
consulting
with
outside
experts
,
and
conducting
public
hearings
,
nas
issued
a
report

entitled
`
veterans
and
agent
orange
:
health
effects
of
herbicides
used
in
vietnam
,
on
july
27
,
1993
.
the
secretary
announced
that
same
day
that
he
had
concluded
that
a
positive
association
exists
between
exposure
to
herbicides
used
in
the
republic
of
vietnam
and
the
subsequent
development
of
hodgkins
disease
and
porphyria
cutanea
tarda
.
proposed
regulations
were
published
in
the
federal
register
on
09/28/1993
(

.
the
secretary
also
announced
that
va
would
review
the
remaining
findings
in
the
nas
report
to
determine
whether
a
positive
association
exists
between
herbicide
exposure
and
any
other
conditions
.
that
review
has
been
completed
and
this
notice

pursuant
to

the
secretarys
determination
