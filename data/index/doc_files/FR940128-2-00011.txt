we
compared

as
stated
in

determination
,
the
department
initiated
an
investigation
under

of
the

to
determine
whether
kt
made

sales
at
less
than

cop
.
if
over
90
percent

sales
of
a
given
model
were
at
prices
above
the
cop
,
we
did
not
disregard
any
belowcost
below
cost
sales
because
we
determined
that
the

below

sales
were
not
made
in
substantial
quantities
.
if
between
ten
and
90
percent
of
the
sales
of

model
were
made
at
prices
below
the
cop
,
and
such
sales
were
made
over
an
extended
period
of
time
,
we
discarded
only
the
belowcost
below

sales
.
where
we
found
that
more

90
percent
of

sales
were
at
prices
below

cop
,
and
such
sales
were
over
an
extended
period

,
we
disregarded
all

calculated
fmv
based
on
cv

no
evidence
was
presented
to
indicate
that

prices
would
permit
recovery
of

reasonable
period

in

to
determine
that

were
made
over

,
we
performed
the
following
analysis
on

basis
:
(

if
respondent
sold
a
model
in
only
one
month
of
the
poi
and
there
were
sales
in
that
month
below
the
cop
,
or
(

if
respondent
sold
a

during
two
months
or
more
of

poi
and
there
were
sales
below
the
cop
during
two
or
more
of
those
months
,
then
belowcost
below
cost
sales
were
considered
to
have
been
made
over
an
extended
period
of
time
.
in
order
to
determine
whether
home
market
prices
were
below
the
cop
,
we
calculated
the
cop

on
the
sum
of

we
corrected
