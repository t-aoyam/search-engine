the
estimates
presented
in
table
2
show
that
the
incremental
risks
from
direct
soil
ingestion
by
children
are
below
what
the
agency
considers
a
level
of
concern
.
a
child
exposed
to
storage
yard
soils
crosscontaminated
cross
contaminated
by
past
users
of
chlorophenolics
under
typical
conditions
(
consumption
of
01
gram
of
soil
day
for
160
days
year
for
six
years
)
would
be
subject
to
an
increased
cancer
risk
of
7e10
over
a
lifetime
,
or
a
chance
of
07
in
a
billion
.
the
estimated
incremental
population
risk
is
also
reduced
approximately
1000fold
fold
(
to
4e7
cases
per
year
over
a
70year
year
period
)
for
the
anticipated
increase
in
the
development
of
cancer
as
a
result
of
exposure
to
direct
ingestion
of
soil
contaminated
with
wastes
from
the
use
of
crosscontaminated
cross
contaminated
formulations
for
wood
surface
protection
.
one
commenter
remarked
that
the
epa
failed
to
specifically
address
the
incremental
risks
to
subsistence
fisher
persons
from
consumption
of
fish
shellfish
contaminated
from
the
use
of
chlorophenolic
formulations
for
wood
surface
protection
.
epa
agrees
that
the
risks
to
highly
exposed
subpopulations
sub
populations
should
be
considered
.
the
fish
ingestion
scenarios
developed
for
the
proposed
rule
considered
exposure
to
a
general
population
and
recreational
fisher
at
the
outflow
of
a
drainage
area
containing
surface
protection
facilities
.
epa
used
the
analysis
for
the
high
end
recreational
fisher
to
approximate
the
risk
to
the
subsistence
fisher
.
recent
data
show
that
the
high
end
ingestion
rate
for
a
subsistence
fisher
is
greater
than
for
a
recreational
fisher
by
a
factor
of
approximately
2
.
therefore
,
the
incremental
risk
for
a
subsistence
fisher
would
not
exceed
a
level
of
concern
,
since
the
projected
risk
to
recreational
fishers
is
much
less
than
10
^

.
.
the
analysis
of
risks
from
fish
consumption
assumes
that
all
fish
in
the
drainage
basin
are
contaminated
.
the
estimates
of
pcdds
and
pcdfs
in
fish
tissue
are
based
on
sediment
concentrations
of
these
constituents
.
the
sediment
concentrations
are
estimated
based
on
the
erosion
of
contaminated
soils
from
sawmill
sites
in
a
river
or
stream
basin
and
subsequent
dilution
of
contaminant
levels
by
the
erosion
of
uncontaminated
soils
from
the
corresponding
drainage
basin
.
the
projected
risk
levels
increase
as
the
size
of
the
drainage
area
decreases
,
due
to
the
relatively
lower
amounts
of
uncontaminated
soil
in
smaller
drainage
basins
.
epa
performed
an
analysis
which
shows
that
,
even
with
all
exposure
parameters
set
at
values
which
would
maximize
the
overall
estimate
of
exposure
,
in
order
to
reach
a
risk
level
of
10
^
6
,
,
the
drainage
area
would
need
to
be
8000
hectares
or
less
,
which
is
smaller
than
the
smallest
drainage
area
in
the
country
.
the
average
drainage
area
is
440000
hectares
,
and
the
lower
fifth
percentile
of
the
size
distribution
is
109000
hectares
.
