the
public
should
be
aware
that
fsis
continues
to
have
interest
in
investigations
of
protein
quality
which
include
among
their
objectives
the
identification
of
improved
methods
for
determining
protein
quality
.
in
evaluating
the
possible
use
of
alternative
approaches
to
assuring
protein

,
fsis
will
consider
data
and
other
comments
submitted
by

tentative
position
:
protein
and
fat
contents
.
fsis
is
considering
allowing
for
two
categories
of
mdp
for
use
in
the
formulation
of
poultry
products
and
meat
food
products
:
(
1
)
a
category
which
meets
minimum
protein
and
maximum
fat
content
requirements
of
not
less
than
14
percent
and
not
more
than
25
percent
,
respectively
,
and
(
2
)
a
category
designated
`
for
processing
'
for
which
there
are
no
protein
or
fat
content
requirements
.
as
discussed
below
,
it
is
contemplated
that
a
wider
range
of
use
would
be
permitted
for
product
containing
not
less
than
14
percent
protein
and
not
more
than
25
percent
fat
,
than
for
product
for
processing
.
poultry
products
produced
by
traditional
deboning
techniques
vary
significantly
in
fat
content
,
largely
depending
on
the
extent
to
which
they
include
skin
(
with
attached
fatty
tissue
)
and
or
separable
fatthe
major
sources
of
fat
in
poultry
.
a
similar
pattern
was
evident
in
the
data
on
mechanically
deboned
poultry
products
reviewed
in
the
1979
health
and
safety
report
,
although
mechanically
deboned
product
tended
to
contain
more
fat
.
this
tendency
is
not
surprising
since
mechanically
deboned
product
frequently
is
prepared
from
necks
,
which
have
a
higher
skin
content
than
other
poultry
parts
,
and
or
backs
,
which
have
a
higher
skin
content
than
other
poultry
parts
,
and
because
it
can
include
bone
marrow
,
which
contains
as
much
or
more
fat
than
skin
.
while
,
as
with
fat
content
,
there
is
considerable
variability
in
the
protein
content
of
both
mechanically
deboned
poultry
and
poultry
products
produced
by
traditional
deboning
techniques
,
in
the
data
reviewed
in
the
1979
health
and
safety
report
on
mdp
,
mdp
generally
contained
less
protein
.
in
addition
,
the
1979
report
found
much
higher
moisture
to
protein
ratios
in
mechanically
deboned
poultry
,
indicating
considerable
dilution
of
poultry
product
,
possibly
by
ice
.
currently
,
the
poultry
products
inspection
regulations
do
not
directly
control
the
fat
or
protein
content
of
poultry
product
ingredients
.
however
,
they
do
differentiate
between
`
poultry
meat
'
and
`
poultry
'
ie
,
chicken
meat
and
chicken
,
with
the
latter
encompassing
edible
parts
such
as
skin
and
fat
not
in
excess
of
their
natural
proportions
in
addition
to
poultry
meat
.
as
skin
(
with
attached
fatty
tissue
)
and
separable
fat
are
the
places
in
which
most
of
the
fat
in
poultry
products
is
found
and
poultry
products
are
composed
essentially
of
fat
,
protein
,
and
moisture
,
these
definitions
have
served
,
to
some
extent
,
to
distinguish
among
poultry
products
in
terms
of
their
relative
fat
and
protein
contents
.
moreover
,
these
differentiations
in
fat
and
protein
have
consequences
for
the
use
of
poultry
product
ingredients
,
since
many
of
the
standards
of
identity
or
composition
for
finished
poultry
products
include
minimum
poultry
meat
requirements
(
9
cfr
381
167
)
and
others
limit
skin
and
fat
to
natural
proportions
(
9
cfr
381
160
.
the
goal
fsis
is
considering
is
to
develop
a
regulatory
approach
that
fulfills
its
responsibility
to
protect
the
public
by
maintaining
the
quality
and
integrity
of
the
poultry
and
meat
food
product
supply
while
continuing
to
permit
flexibility
in
the
composition
of
mechanically
deboned
poultry
product
,
as
well
as
in
its
use
at
various
levels
in
a
broad
range
of
products
.
in
fsiss
view
,
its
responsibility
to
the
public
includes
the
objectives
of
preventing
increases
in
the
fat
content
of
this
portion
of
the
food
supply
and
preventing
poultry
product
dilution
that
could
result
in
the
public
no
longer
being
able
to
rely
on
poultry
products
and
meat
food
products
as
reasonably
good
sources
of
high
quality
dietary
protein
.
fsis
is
considering
that
mdp
should
have
a
fat
content
of
not
more
than
25
percent
and
a
protein
content
of
not
less
than
14
percent
or
it
shall
be
deemed
to
be
product
for
processing
.
if
these
views
are
adopted
,
the
effect
of
this
provision
would
be
to
impose
no
maximum
on
the
fat
content
or
minimum
on
the
protein
content
of
this
ingredient
where
other
regulatory
provisions
assure
that
the
fat
content
of
finished
products
does
not
exceed
appropriate
limits
and
protect
against
decreases
in
their
protein
content
by
establishing
finished
product
content
requirements
.
in
such
a
product
,
it
is
contemplated
that
mdp
could
be
used
,
regardless
of
its
fat
or
protein
content
,
in
ingredient
mixtures
that
accord
with
the
standard
for
the
finished
product
.
(

tentative
position
:
quality
control
.
fsis
is
considering
that
a
quality
control
program
is
necessary
to
assure
that
establishments
manufacture
mechanically
deboned
poultry
product
that
complies
consistently
with
the
tentative
definition
and
standard
that
is
being
considered
by
fsis
.
utilization
of
such
a
program
in
producing
the
ingredient
mdp
would
be
a
prerequisite
for
the
approval
of
labels
for
products
consisting
of
or
containing
mdp
.
the
function
of
plant
quality
control
is
to
restrict
potential
variability
within
the
limits
of
the
tentative
requirements
fsis
is
considering
by
controlling
the
factors
that
can
affect
the
resulting
products
characteristics
.
