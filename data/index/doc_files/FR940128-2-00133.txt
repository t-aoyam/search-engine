the
claimant
sought
review
in
district
court
under
section

)
of
the
act
.
reversing
the
secretary
,
the
district
court
held
that
the
secretary
had
erred
in
her
decision
on
this
case
and
remanded
the
case
under
sentence
four

of

the

subsequently
awarded
benefits
.
more
than
a
year
later
,
the
claimant
filed
a
petition
for
attorneys
fees
under
the
eaja
.
the
secretary
,
in
response
,
noted
that
the
claimant
was
required
to
file
the
petition
for
eaja
fees
`
within
30
days
of
final
judgment
in
the
action
'
pursuant
to
28
usc
.
2412d1b
,
and
argued
that
the
`
final
judgment
'
in
this
case
was
the
administrative
decision
on
remand
.
the
district
court
relied
on
welter
v
.
sullivan
in
which
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
the
district
court
did
not
intend
to
enter
final
judgment
when
it
remanded
the
plaintiffs
'
cases
under
sentence
four
.
when
the
secretary
appealed
schaefer
to
the
circuit
court
,
the
court
declined
the
secretarys
suggestion
for
en
banc
reconsideration
of
welter
.
the
circuit
court
affirmed
the
district
courts
award
of
eaja
fees
to
the
claimant
.
on
review
by
the
supreme
court
,
the
secretary
argued
that
,
in
light
of
the
supreme
courts
decisions
in
sullivan
v
.
finkelstein
and
melkonyan
v
.
sullivan
,
,
a
district
court
cannot
retain
jurisdiction
of
a
case
after
a
remand
under
sentence
four
of
section
205g
)
of
the
act
.
although
the
supreme
court
affirmed
the
circuit
courts
decision
to
award
eaja
fees
,
it
rejected
its
analysis
.
the
court
held
that
,
under
the
clear
language
of
section
205g
)
of
the
act
,
a
district
court
may
not
retain
jurisdiction
after
a
sentence
four
remand
.
the
court
found
that
a
sentence
four
remand
is
an
appealable
final
judgment
of
the
district
court
that
terminates
the
action
and
makes
a
plaintiff
a
`
prevailing
party
'
for
the
purposes
of
the
eaja
.
the
court
clarified
dicta
in
sullivan
v
.
hudson
,
,
emphasizing
that
a
sentence
four
remand
(
as
opposed
to
a
remand
under
sentence
six
of
section
205g
,
in
which
the
court
retains
jurisdiction
of
the
case
)
confers
prevailing
party
status
on
the
plaintiff
.
the
court
also
clarified
that
,
in
a
sentence
four
remand
,
the
time
period
in
which
an
eaja
petition
must
be
filed
begins
at
the
conclusion
of
the
appeal
period
following
the
district
courts
entry
of
a
judgment
.
however
,
in
this
case
,
the
court
found
that
,
because
the
district
court
failed
to
enter
a
judgment
pursuant
to
rule
58
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
,
neither
the
appeal
period
nor
the
eaja
30day
day
filing
period
had
lapsed
.
for
the
foregoing
reasons
,
the
court
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals

court
justice
