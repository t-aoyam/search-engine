tentative
position
:
bone
solids
content
.
fsis
is
considering
having
the
bone
solids
content
of
boneless
poultry
product
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
be
measured
by
calcium
analysis
with
a
maximum
calcium
content
of
not
more
than
0
147
percent
in
product
made
from
turkeys
or
mature
chickens
or
0
111
percent
in
product
made
from
other
poultry
.
both
of
these
levels
account
for
the
fact
that
poultry
tissues
,
other
than
bone
,
contain
some
calcium
and
that
turkeys
and
mature
chickens
contain
more
calcium
naturally
than
other
poultry
.
fsis
is
considering
,
as
discussed
below
,
that
production
of
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
under
an
approved
quality
control
program
is
necessary
to
assure
consistent
compliance
with
regulatory
requirements
,
including
the
calcium
content
requirement
utilized
in
restricting
bone
solids
content
.
the
inclusion
of
these
calcium
content
levels
should
not
be
misinterpreted
as
indicating
a
concern
about
the
amount
of
the
essential
nutrient
calcium
that
is
provided
by
poultry
and
meat
food
products
.
fsis
considers
that
,
even
assuming
all
further
processed
poultry
were
comprised
of
boneless
poultry
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
,
the
projected
calcium
contribution
of
such
product
would
represent
only
a
negligible
increase
in
per
capita
daily
intakes
and
cannot
be
considered
hazardous
,
particularly
since
the
dietary
intake
of
a
large
sector
of
the
population
may
be
below
the
recommended
level
of
calcium
consumption
.
for
the
new
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
,
the
calcium
level
would
be
significantly
lower
than
mechanically
deboned
poultry
.

tentative
position
:
bone
particle
size
.
fsis
is
considering
that
the
size
of
the
bone
particles
in
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
should
be
restricted
to
a
maximum
of
less
than
15
millimeter
(
mm
)
in
the
greatest
dimension
,
but
permitting
up
to
5
bone
particles
per
50
grams
of
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
to
be
from
15
mm
to
less
than
2
mm
in
the
greatest
dimension
.
fsiss
objective
is
that
the
limitation
imposed
be
adequate
to
prevent
any
digestibility
problems
while
not
restricting
the
operation
of
equipment
in
accordance
with
the
improved
good
manufacturing
practices
more
than
is
necessary
for
this
purpose
or
to
protect
finished
product
quality
.
bone
particle
size
should
be
controlled
to
ensure
that
equipment
type
or
processing
does
not
result
in
unacceptably
large
fragments
and
,
provided
this
is
done
,
the
bone
particles
in
the
product
will
not
present
any
health
hazard
because
of
size
or
hardness
.
fsis
is
considering
that
it
is
appropriate
to
permit
up
to
5
particles
per
50
grams
of
product
to
be
from
15
mm
to
less
than
2
mm
as
an
acceptable
defect
in
complying
product
.
fsis
is
requesting
comments
and
information
on
the
extent
to
which
manufacturers
should
be
required
to
control
the
production
of
boneless
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
that
have
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
to
limit
the
size
of
bone
particles
.
fsis
will
consider
any
information
submitted
during
the
comment
period
on
the
size
and
distribution
of
bone
particles
that
may
occur
with
various
mechanical
deboning
procedures
conducted
in
accordance
with
improved
good
manufacturing
practices
(
eg
,
the
extent
to
which
deviations
or
nonconforming

occur
,
and

substantiating
the
absence
of

with
such

of
