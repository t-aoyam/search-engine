processing
of
reactor
fuel
and
other
waste
management
activities
created
a
wide
variety
of
radioactive
wastes
,
including
highlevel
high
level
wastes
that
have
been
stored
in
underground
tanks
.
the
highlevel
high
level
wastes
came
from
many
different
processes
and
sources
,
and
they
have
been
processed
and
transferred
among
tanks
so
that
chemical
and
physical
characteristics
of
the
wastes
vary
greatly
among
tanks
and
even
within
individual
tanks
.
typically
,
the
tank
wastes
are
highly
radioactive
and
chemically
hazardous
.
ssts
have
one
steel
wall
,
surrounded
by
reinforced
concrete
;
they
were
constructed
between
1944
and
1964
and
received
waste
until
1980
.
the
capacity
of
most
ssts
is
05
million
gallons
(
mgal
)
to
1
mgal
.
the
tanks
are
situated
below
grade
and
are
covered
with
6
to
10
feet
of
earth
.
waste
in
ssts
consists
of
liquids
,
sludges
,
and
saltcake
,
ie
,
crusty
solids
made
of
crystallized
salts
.
some
of
the
liquids
in
the
ssts
are
contained
in
the
pores
of
the
sludges
and
saltcake
,
and
some
liquids
are
free
standing
in
the
tanks
.
there
are
149
ssts
storing
about
36
mgal
of
waste
.
this
waste
is
comprised
of
approximately
06
mgal
of
freestanding
free
standing
liquid
,
232
mgal
of
saltcake
,
and
125
mgal
of
sludge
.
about
half
of
the
ssts
have
leaked
or
are
assumed
to
have
leaked
.
approximately
06
to
09
mgal
of
waste
has
leaked
or
spilled
into
the
nearby
soil
.
over
the
years
,
much
of
the
liquid
stored
in
ssts
has
evaporated
or
been
pumped
to
dsts
.
there
are
28
one
mgal
dsts
at
hanford
.
the
dsts
were
constructed
between
1970
and
1986
.
most
of
these
tanks
are
designed
for
up
to
50
years
of
storage
.
dsts
have
a
second
steel
containment
wall
.
the
space
between
the
two
walls
is
monitored
for
leaks
.
doe
has
used
the
dsts
since
1970
and
none
has
been
known
to
leak
.
the
dsts
are
used
to
treat
and
store
a
variety
of
liquid
radioactive
wastes
from
the
ssts
and
from
various
hanford
site
processes
.
the
wastes
are
stored
in
tanks
based
upon
composition
,
level
of
radioactivity
,
or
origin
.
the
dsts
now
contain
about
25
mgal
of
waste
.
in
the
1960s
and
1970s
,
radioactive
strontium
and
cesium
were
extracted
from
wastes
in
some
ssts
.
the
strontium
and
cesium
were
converted
to
salt
forms
and
placed
in
doublewalled
double
walled
capsules
.
most
of
the
610
strontium
capsules
and
1323
cesium
capsules
are
stored
at
hanford
.
some
capsules
were
shipped
offsite
for
beneficial
use
as
heat
or
radiation
sources
.
because
the
capsules
were
only
leased
from
doe
,
it
is
anticipated
that
they
will
be
returned
to
hanford
.
in
the
04/19/1988
hdw
eis
rod
,
doe
decided
to
proceed
with
preparing
the
dst
waste
for
final
disposal
because
it
was
readily
retrievable
.
wastes
were
to
be
processed
in
a
pretreatment
facility
(
planned
to
be
the
hanford
bplant
b
plant
and
ar
vault
)
to
separate
dst
waste
into
two
portions
.
the
larger
portion
would
be
low
activity
waste
,
and
a
much
smaller
portion
would
be
highly
radioactive
.
the
low
activity
waste
was
to
be
mixed
with
a
cementlike
cement
like
material
to
form
grout
.
the
grout
was
to
be
poured
into
large
,
lined
,
concrete
,
nearsurface
near
surface
,
underground
vaults
where
it
would
solidify
.
the
high
activity
waste
fraction
was
to
be
made
into
a
borosilicate
glass
and
poured
into
stainlesssteel
stainless
steel
canisters
(
approximately
06
m
diameter
by
3
m
long
)
at
the
proposed
hanford
waste
vitrification
plant
(
hwvp
.
the
canisters
were
to
be
stored
there
until
a
geologic
repository
was
ready
to
receive
this
waste
.
existing
and
future
dst
wastes
were
to
be
characterized
for
hazardous
chemical
constituents
as
well
as
other
constituents
that
might
affect
glass
or
grout
formulations
before
processing
.
this
characterization
would
also
help
ensure
that
proper
treatment
,
in
accordance
with
hazardous
waste
regulations
,
occurred
before
disposal
of
the
waste
.
the
hdw
eis
rod
also
called
for
storage
of
cesium
and
strontium
capsules
to
continue
until
a
geologic
repository
is
ready
to
receive
this
waste
for
disposal
.
before
shipment
to
the
repository
,
the
capsules
would
be
packaged
to
meet
repository
acceptance
criteria
.
in
the
hdw
eis
rod
,
doe
decided
to
conduct
additional
development
and
evaluation
before
making
decisions
on
final
disposal
of
sst
wastes
.
this
development
and
evaluation
effort
was
to
focus
both
on
methods
to
retrieve
and
process
sst
wastes
for
disposal
and
to
stabilize
and
isolate
the
wastes
nearsurface
near
surface
.
sst
waste
would
continue
to
be
stored
and
monitored
.
before
a
decision
on
the
final
disposal
of
the
wastes
could
be
made
,
the
alternatives
were
to
be
analyzed
in
a
supplement
to
the
hdw
eis
.
several
significant
changes
have
occurred
subsequent
to
the
hdw
eis
.
these
include
the
identification
of
significant
waste
tank
safety
issues
;
the
doe
,
epa
and
ecology
signing
the
tpa
;
the
elimination
of
bplant
b
plant
from
consideration
as
a
waste
pretreatment
facility
;
the
delay
of
the
hwvp
;
and
the
proposal
to
treat
sst
waste
with
dst
waste
.
these
changes
resulted
in
does
proposal
to
integrate
all
hanford
tank
waste
remediation
efforts
.
as
a
result
,
resolving
waste
tank
safety
issues
,
planning
for
sst
waste
retrieval
,
and
developing
pretreatment
facilities
have
become
major
elements
of
