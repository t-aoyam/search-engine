and
the

[

indicates
that
about
20
%
of
all
office
workers
are
afflicted
with
such
symptoms
.
if
the
20
%
level
were
to
be
considered
as
`
background
,
a
simple
approach
would
be
to
determine
that
any
building

more
than
20
%
of
whose
occupants
report
the
symptoms
,
would
be
considered

be

the

arises
as
to
how
much
greater
than
20

would
the

have
to
be

can
cause
substantial
variations

,
even
in

the
problem
with
many

of

is
that
rarely
have

been

to
determine
background

.
until

it

that

done
to

the

on
the
basis
of
the
