`
initial
assessments
'
are
different
from
`
initial
monitoring
'
required
in
the
1986
standards
.
`
initial
monitoring
'
as
used
for
processes
in
general
industry
,
was
rationally
relied
on
to
estimate
future
exposures
for
that
purpose
.
historic

second

.
the
new
requirement
for
`
initial
exposure
assessments
'
acknowledges
that
initial
exposure
monitoring
in
many
cases
cannot
adequately
predict
all
future
exposures
on
construction
jobs
.
even
if
monitoring
results
were
instantaneously
available
,
the
value
of
early
exposure
monitoring
in
predicting
later
exposures
over
a
multiday
day
asbestos
job
is
limited
.
firstday
first
day
exposures
are
likely
to
be
lower
than
later
exposures
,
because
they
reflect
early
setup
set
rather
than
removal
activities
,
conducted
in
relatively
clean
areas
before
disturbance
may
contaminate
the
regulated
area
.
one
purpose
of
the
initial
exposure
assessment
is
to
identify
which
asbestos
jobs
are
likely
to
exceed
the
pel
in
time
for
employers
to
install
and
implement
the
extra
controls
required
to
reduce
such
exposures
.
such
additional
controls
may
consist
of
ventilation
which
redirects
the
air
away
from
the
overexposed
exposed
employees
,
and
mandatory
protective
clothing
and
hygiene
facilities
associated
with
donning
and
removing
such
gear
.
even
employers
who
are
planning
to
install
full
negative
pressure
enclosures
with
air
flushing
technology
must
conduct
initial
exposure
assessments
.
this
will
insure
that
the
`
competent
person
'
has
reviewed
the
success
of
controls
in
past
projects
,
in
order
to
evaluate
the
planned
controls
for
the
current
project
.
testimony
and
comment
to
the
record
emphasized
that
the
evaluation
of
industrial
hygienists
or
other
properly
trained
personnel
was
essential
to
decision
making
on
how
best
to
protect
workers
.
for
example
,
david

agreed
with
the
statement
that
before
there
is
any
operation
involving
asbestos
containing
material
,
the
industrial
hygiene
staff
makes
a
determination
as
to
whether
thats
