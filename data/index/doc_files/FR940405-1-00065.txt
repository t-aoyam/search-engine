differences
in
ms

ss
emissions
are
due
to
differences
in
the
temperature
of
the
combustion
of
tobacco

degree

and

differences
in
ms
and

are
also
ascribable
to
differences
in
the
oxygen
concentration
(

ss
contaminants
are
generated
in
a
more

those

which

nitrosamines

example
,
are
present
in
greater
concentrations
in

than

many
of
the
compounds
found

which

are
also

all

little

the
lack
of
substantial
variability
in
ss
emissions
is
related
to
the
fact
that
they
are
primarily
related
to
the
weight
of
tobacco
and

consumed

human

human

studies
utilize
random
samples
of
human
activity
patterns
using
questionnaires
and
timediary
time
diary
data
to
provide
detailed
generalizable
data
about
human
behavior
.
such
studies
have
been
used
to
assess
exposure
to
ets
.
in
19871988
,
the
california
air
resources
board
sponsored
a
probabilitybased
probability
based
crosssectional
cross
sectional
sample
of
1579
californians
aged
18
years
and
older
,
called
the
california
activity
pattern
survey
(
caps
)
[
exs
.
4168
,
4271
.
the
study
was
designed
to
provide
information
on
time
spent
in
various
locations
,
including
indoors
,
outdoors
,
and
in
transit
,
as
well
as
specific
microenvironments
,
such
as
living
rooms
,
kitchens
,
automobiles
,
or
buses
.
the
study
focused
on
time
spent
in
activities
such
as
cooking
or
playing
sports
,
but
more
specifically
targeted
activities
and
environments
that
had
implications
for
air
pollution
exposure
,
such
as
the
presence
of
smokers
,
use
of
cooking
equipment
or
solvents
.
in
analyzing
the
data
from
caps
,
jenkins
et
al
.
[
ex
.
4168
]
and
robinson
et
al
.
[
ex
.
4271
]
found
that
time
spent
at
work
had
a
high
correlation
with
exposure
to
ets
.
this
association
of
ets
exposure
with
work
settings
remained
strong
after
controlling
for
the
length
of
the
activity
episode
,
and
hence
was
not
simply
a
function
of
longer
time
intervals
at
work
.
robinson
et
al
.
[
ex
.
4271
]
also
found
that
men
reported
higher
levels
of
exposure
than
women
,
even
after
controlling
for
age
,
employment
status
,
shorter
working
hours
,
etc
.
this
finding
suggests
that
the
epidemiological
studies
of
passive
smoking
and
lung
cancer
,
which
have
focussed
on
women
,
may
be
underestimating
the
effect
of
ets
on
lung
cancer
.
further
analysis
of
the
cap
study
[
ex
.
4169
]
verifies
the
high
percentage
of
nonsmokers
who
are
exposed
to
ets
while
at
work
.
this
is
indicated
when
the
data
are
analyzed
by
employed
nonsmoker
status
.
as
indicated
in
table
iii8
iii
,
51
%
of
male
and
38
%
of
female
nonsmokers
reported
ets
exposure
at
work
.
the
average
duration
of
this
exposure
was
313
minutes
for
males
and
350
minutes
for
females
.
when
the
group
that
reported
exposure
at
the
workplace
is
analyzed
further
it
becomes
apparent
that
the
overwhelming
exposure
location
for
these
employed
nonsmokers
is
the
workplace
(
table
iii9
iii
.
as
indicated
in
table
iii9
iii
,
77
%
of
males
and
85
%
of
females
were
exposed
an
average
of
313
minutes
and
350
minutes
,
respectively
.
one
other
finding
is
that
the
more
time
spent
at
work
,
the
higher
the
likelihood
of
greater
ets
exposure
.
for
example
,
the
average
duration
of
exposure
to
homemakers
was
approximately
2
hours
a
day
,
for
workers
the
average
duration
of
exposure
was
approximately
3
hours
a
day
.
