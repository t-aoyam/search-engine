best
information
available
in
conducting
our
analysis
of
related
parties
in
this
review
,
we
issued
three
supplemental
questionnaires
and
granted
extensions
for
several
of
the
responses
.
in
spite
of
this
,
laperle
did
not
provide
us
with
enough
information
to
adequately
support
its
position
as
an
independent
entity
.
because
none
of
the
individual
components
of
this
entity
responded
to
our
questionnaire
,
other
than
laperle
,
and
because
laperle
,
as
the
responding
party
,
failed
to
submit
a
consolidated
response
,
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
required
information
was
provided
.
although
laperle
has
provided
a
partial
response
to
our
questionnaire
,
laperle
has
not
submitted
a
response
consolidating
all
information
for
all
parties
related
to
it
,
and
we
are
not
able
to
use
laperles
responses
for
purposes
of
this
review
.
therefore
,
we
have
considered
laperle
uncooperative
.
the
application
of
firsttier
first
tier
bia
is
appropriate
because
laperle
has
impeded
the
proceeding
by
failing
to
give
the
department
the
information
necessary
to
conduct
the
review
and
by
failing
to
provide
sufficient
support
that
it
was
independent
.
therefore
,
in
accordance
with
section

of
the
tariff

the
department
will
issue

instructions
on
each
exporter
directly
to
the
customs
service
.
because
we
have
completed
to
review
for
the
period
,
03/01/1992
,
through
02/28/1993
,
the
cash
deposit
requirement
for
merchandise
subject
to
the
order
will
not
be
changed
by
the
final
results
of
this
administrative
review
,
except
in
the
case
of
two
of
the
entitys
components
.
moreover
,
since
there
were
no
requests
for
reviews
of
other
companies
which
were
related
to
laperle
,
entries
of
all
the
additional
firms
'
merchandise
have
been
liquidated
in
accordance
with
19
cfr

.
therefore
,
only
two
of
the
companies
not
included
in
the
notice
of
initiation
will
have
cash
deposit
rates
established
by
this
administrative
review
.
accordingly
,
for
these
two
firms
we
will
instruct
customs
to
require
cash
deposits
of
98
percent
,
the
rate
assigned
to
the
entire
entity
.
this
notice
also
serves
as
a
preliminary
reminder
to
importers
of
their
responsibility
under
19
cfr
353
26
to
file
a
certificate
regarding
the
reimbursement
of
antidumping
duties
prior
to
liquidation
of
the
relevant
entries
during
this
review
period
.
failure
to
comply
with
this
requirement
could
result
in
the
secretarys
presumption
that
reimbursement
of
antidumping
duties
occurred
and
the
subsequent
assessment
of
double
antidumping
duties
.
