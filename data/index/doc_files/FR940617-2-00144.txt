supplementary
information
:
aphelocoma
coerulescens
coerulescens
is
geographically
isolated
from
other
subspecies
of
scrub
jays
found
in
mexico
and
the
western
united
states
.
the
florida
scrub
jay
is
found
almost
exclusively
in
peninsular
florida
and
is
restricted
to
scrub
habitat
.
the
total
estimated
population
is
between
7000
and
11000
individuals
.
due
to
habitat
loss
and
degradation
throughout
the
state
of
florida
,
it
has
been
estimated
that
the
florida
scrub
jay
population
has
been
reduced
by
at
least
half
in
the
last
100
years
.
surveys
have
indicated
that
suitable
florida
scrub
jay
habitat
exists
on
the
applicants
property
and
surrounding
areas
.
construction
of
this
individual
homesite
may
therefore
result
in
death
of
,
or
injury
to
,
aphelocoma
coerulescens
coerulescens
incidental
to
the
carrying
out
of
these
otherwise
lawful
activities
.
habitat
alteration
associated
with
property
development
may
reduce
the
availability
of
feeding
,
shelter
,
and
nesting
habitat
.
the
ea
considers
the
environmental
consequences
of
two
alternatives
.
the
no
action
alternative
may
result
in
some
loss
of
habitat
for
aphelocoma
coerulescens
coerulescens
and
exposure
of
the
applicant
under
section
9
of
the
act
.
this
action
is
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
and
intent
of
section
10
of
the
act
.
the
proposed
action
alternative
is
issuance
of
the
incidental
take
permit
.
this
provides
for
restrictions
of
construction
activity
,
monitoring
florida
scrub
jay
activity
during
construction
of
the
home
,
retaining
natural
vegetation
to
the
maximum
extent
practicable
,
enhancing
native
vegetation
through
replanting
,
a
prohibition
on
pets
,
and
installation
of
a
bird
feeder
and
bird
bath
on
the
property
.
the
hcp
provides
a
funding
mechanism
for
these
mitigation
measures
.
