the

industry

shipbuilding
and
repairing
is
a
largescale
large
scale
manufacturing
activity
that
requires
both
skilled
and
unskilled
labor
.
shipyard
work
can
be
categorized
into
three
main
operations
:
(
1
)
ship
construction
,
(

)
ship
repair
,
and
(

,
or

operations

or

asbestos
products
were
used
extensively
on
american
ships
from
the
early
1940s
through
the
late
1970s
in
joiner
bulkhead
systems
in

[

however
,
after
1973
,
new
specifications
reduced
the
use
of
asbestos
on
ships
regulated
by
the
maritime
administration
(
marad
.
use
of
asbestos
was
only
permitted
in
insulation
cement
in
lagging
for
machinery
casings
and
in
lagging
cloth
.
since
1978
,
specifications
for
governmentsubsidized
government
subsidized
ships
have
required
the
elimination
of
all
asbestos
lagging
and
insulation
materials
.
therefore
,
current
ship
building
activities
ordinarily
do
not
generate
any
worker
exposure
to
asbestos
.
however
,
osha
believes
that
all
ships
delivered
before
1975
contain
extensive
asbestos
insulation
materials
,
and
that
ships
delivered
between
1975
and
1978
contain
asbestos
in
the
form
of
insulating
cement
on
machinery
casings

materials
during

activities

occupational
exposure
to
asbestos
.
the
greatest
potential
for
occupational
exposure
to
asbestos
occurs
during
removal
activities
due
to
sawing
,
tearing
,
cutting
,
and
scraping
operations
.
additional
sources
of
asbestos
exposure
,
involving
a
small
number
of
shipyard
workers
,
occur
during
repair
activities
such
as
removal
and
installation
of
gaskets
[
osha
,

.
whenever
possible
,
asbestos
is
thoroughly
wetted
during
removal
activities
.
however
,
wet
removal
in
nuclear
reactor
compartments
is
not
permitted
because
of
possible
radiation
contamination
