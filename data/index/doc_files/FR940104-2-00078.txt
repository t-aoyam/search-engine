the

was
based
upon
the
belief
that
listing

be
more
beneficial

believes
that

marketmakers
market
makers
will
result
in
increased
visibility

secure
its
own
group
of
marketmakers
market
makers
and
,
in
doing
so
,
expand
the
capital
base

)
the
company
believes
that
firms
making
a
market
in
the
companys
common
stock
on
the
nasdaq
nms
system
will
be
inclined
to
issue
