direct
the

improvements
in
machinery
for
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
the
agency
has
monitored
the
advances
in
the
technology
for
mechanically
separating
poultry
,
also
referred
to
as
mechanical
deboning
,
over
the
last
decade
.
there
have
been
improvements
in
the
efficiency
of
the
mechanical
separation
and
removal
of
most
of
the
bone
from
attached
skeletal
muscle
and
tissue
of
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
poultry
carcasses
.
today
,
it
has
been
estimated
that
roughly
1
billion
pounds
of
raw
poultry
materials
are
used
to
manufacture
700
million
pounds
of
mechanically
separated
poultry
,
also
referred
to
as
mechanically
deboned
poultry
(
mdp
,
which
is
used
,
in
turn
,
to
formulate
approximately
400
million
pounds
of
poultry
sausages
(
including
franks
,
bologna
,
and
salami
,
and
300
million
pounds
of
poultry
nuggets
and
poultry
patties
.
there
have
been
major
advances
in
mechanical
deboning
machinery
in
terms
of
the
effectiveness
of
bone
removal
from
skeletal
muscle
and
other
tissues
of
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
.
this
has
been
accomplished
through
enhancements
and
modifications
of
the
boneremoval
bone
removal
devices
that
are
part
of
the
mechanical
deboning
machines
.
there
have
been
continued
refinements
of
certain
operational
parameters
of
the
machinery
,
eg
,
the
ability
for
operators
to
adjust
the
pressure
needed
to
force
ground
poultry
bones
with
adhering
muscle
and
other
tissues
through
screens
to
separate
muscle
and
other
tissues
from
bone
,
and
the
size
of
the
apertures
(
ie
,
holes
)
in
the
screens
and
sieves
through
which
the
ground
bones
,
muscle
,
and
other
tissues
are
pushed
.

in
1969
,
the
agency
amended
the
regulations
for
poultry
and
poultry
products
inspection
to
,
among
other
things
,
provide
labeling
requirements
for
boneless
poultry
products
,
as
well
as
a
prescribed
bone
solids
content
of
not
more
than
1
percent
(
34
fr
13991
.
this
limit
was
based
on
an
evaluation
conducted
by
the
department
of
the
operating
results
in
a
series
of
poultry
establishments
that
used
mechanical
deboning
equipment
.
analyses
were
made
of
485
samples
of
raw
,
mechanically
deboned
product
from
nine
commercial
operations
that
used
the
three
types
of
machines
most
often
used
in
the
process
.
the
analyses
showed
that
the
equipment
,
at
that
time
,
could
be
operated
under
commercial
conditions
to
produce
boneless
poultry
that
contained
no
more
than
1
percent
bone
solids
,
on
a
raw
weight
basis
,
and
the
department
concluded
that
it
was
demonstrated
that
it
was
practical
to
limit
the
bone
content
in
deboned
poultry
to
1
percent
.
in
light
of
the
improvements
that
have
occurred
with
regard
to
the
machinery
used
to
mechanically
separate
and
remove
most
of
the
bone
from
the
muscle
and
other
tissues
of
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
,
fsis
recently
conducted
a
study
of
the
bone
solids
content
of
mechanically
separated
poultry
.
the
percentage
of
bone
solids
content
(
determined
by
calcium
analysis
)
in
boneless
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
was
collected
from
approximately
50
establishments
during
08/19/1993
,
and
represented
a
sampling
of
over
2000
products
.
the
data
indicate
that
the
mean
bone
solids
content
of
the
samples
of
these
products
was
approximately
06
percent
;
generally
,
half
of
the
samples
were
above
06
percent
and
half
were
below
06
percent
