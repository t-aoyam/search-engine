air
pollution
impacts
the
hap
emissions
from
finishing
and
gluing
operations
are
controlled
through
emission
limits
on
the
finishing
materials
and
contact
adhesives
used
by
the
industry
and
through
work
practice
standards
.
emissions
from
cleaning
operations
will
be
reduced
through
work
practice
standards
and
an
emission
limit
for
strippable
spray
booth
coatings
.
emissions
of
voc
that
are
both
hap
and
nonhap
hap
may
be
controlled
in
the
process
of
meeting
the
requirements
for
hap
reduction
.
the
quantity
of
those
nonhap
hap
vocs
that
will
be
removed
,
however
,
has
not
been
quantified
.
the
estimated
primary
and
secondary
air
pollution
impacts
that
would
result
from
implementing
the
proposed
standards
are
summarized
below
.
a
.
primary
air
pollution
impacts
.
the
immediate
air
pollution
impacts
resulting
from
the
proposed
standards
would
be
a
reduction
in
the
emission
of
hap
by
the
source
category
.
at
baseline
conditions
(
ie
,
the
conditions
that
exist
in
the
absence
of
neshap
,
total
estimated
hap
emissions
from
existing
sources
are
50584
mg
yr
(
55744
tons
yr
.
if
the
proposed
standards
were
enacted
,
these
emissions
would
drop
to
approximately
20825
mg
yr
(
22949
tons
yr
.
this
is
a
total
estimated
hap
emission
reduction
of
29759
mg
yr
(
32795
tons
yr
.
the
actual
reduction
in
emissions
may
be
larger
than
that
estimated
here
because
the
estimate
did
not
account
for
the
reduction
of
hap
from
a
number
of
the
work
practice
standards
.
while
most
of
the
work
practice
standards
are
expected
to
reduce
emissions
,
it
is
difficult
to
quantify
the
actual
reduction
.
emission
reductions
resulting
from
the
restrictions
on
the
use
of
conventional
air
spray
guns
and
the
operator
training
program
were
estimated
,
but
no
emission
reduction
was
assigned
to
the
other
work
practice
standards
.
therefore
,
the
emission
reduction
presented
here
does
not
reflect
the
total
reductions
that
may
be
achieved
through
the
work
practice
standards
.
the
proposed
standards
could
also
potentially
result
in
a
decline
in
voc
emissions
and
a
reduction
in
ozone
or
photochemical
smog
.
while
the
hap
limits
do
not
require
the
use
of
lowervoc
lower
voc
materials
,
the
work
practice
standards
should
reduce
the
use
of
voc
containing
materials
and
,
therefore
,
voc
emissions
.
b
.
secondary
air
pollution
impacts
.
the
proposed
standards
are
not
expected
to
result
in
any
secondary
air
pollution
impacts
.
secondary
emissions
of
air
pollutants
typically
result
from
generation
of
the
energy
needed
to
operate
control
devices
.
if
some
facilities
choose
to
meet
the
proposed
standards
through
the
use
of
control
devices
there
could
be
some
secondary
air
pollution
impacts
resulting
from
the
use
of
these
devices
.
these
have
not
been
quantified
here
because
it
is
anticipated
that
most
facilities
will
meet
the
limits
through
the
use
of
reformulated
materials
.
