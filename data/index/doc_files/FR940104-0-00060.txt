one
commenter
suggested
that
it
would
be
more
appropriate
to
calculate
the
average
peak
concentration
of
pentachlorophenate
in
groundwater
used
to
reflect
a
9year
year
exposure
duration
by
producing
a
breakthrough
curve
of
annual
concentrations
at
a
well
using
the
multimed
model
and
calculate
a
series
of
9year
year
or
10year
year
moving
averages
.
the
moving
averages
would
be
sorted
in
descending
order
and
a
paper
plot
prepared
.
a
preferred
percentile
value
could
then
be
selected
as
the
concentration
of
concern
.
epa
believes
the
current
method
of
calculating
10year
year
timeweighted
time
weighted
averages
by
averaging
two
5year
year
concentrations
(
including
the
maximum
concentration
and
the
highest
adjacent
5year
year
value
calculated
from
each
model
run
)
is
an
appropriate
approach
for
estimating
lifetime
individual
risk
and
the
agency
selected
this
approach
to
be
conservative
and
protective
of
human
health
.
the
30year
year
exposure
duration
scenario
uses
a
timeweighted
time
weighted
30year
year
average
concentration
that
includes
the
maximum
concentration
.
population
risk
estimates
aggregated
over
70
years
were
based
on
a
timeweighted
time
weighted
70year
year
average
concentration
that
includes
the
maximum
concentration
.
one
commenter
believed
that
the
source
concentration
used
by
epa
for
pcp
in
the
groundwater
ground
water
ingestion
scenario
was
too
high
because
pcp
is
no
longer
in
use
and
,
thus
,
the
infiltration
to
ground
water
would
be
reduced
.
the
commenter
suggested
that
source
reduction
also
would
occur
from
erosion
of
surface
soil
containing
pcp
,
before
it
is
leached
and
enters
the
ground
water
.
epa
addressed
the
fact
that
pcp
is
no
longer
in
use
at
most
facilities
in
its
baseline
risk
estimates
in
the
proposed
rule
,
which
have
been
revised
in
the
final
rule
based
on
comments
received
to
reflect
source
concentrations
and
pulse
durations
(
estimated
time
in
which
pentachlorophenate
is
expected
to
be
present
in
substitute
wood
surface
protection
product
from
time
of
changeover
)
more
representative
of
the
crosscontamination
cross
contamination
scenario
.
while
surface
runoff
and
erosion
may
reduce
the
amount
of
pcp
available
for
leaching
to
ground
water
,
epa
has
assumed
,
for
the
purpose
of
its
analysis
,
that
any
reductions
are
negligible
.
the
epa
adopted
this
conservative
assumption
mainly
because
of
lack
of
data
necessary
to
quantify
such
a
loss
and
its
effects
on
groundwater
ground
water
concentrations
.
furthermore
,
epa
does
not
believe
that
surface
water
and
erosion
will
significantly
reduce
source
leachate
concentrations
.
as
formulation
drips
onto
the
soil
it
will
rapidly
penetrate
the
soil
until
the
soil
is
saturated
.
subsequent
rain
events
may
wash
off
contaminated
surface
soil
,
but
will
not
erode
deeper
soil
horizons
where
most
of
the
contaminant
mass
resides
.
thus
,
epa
does
not
consider
this
assumption
to
be
overly
conservative
.
one
commenter
noted
that
the
results
of
the
groundwater
ground
water
analysis
were
not
supported
by
actual
resource
damage
data
.
the
agency
does
not
expect
,
nor
does
it
feel
that
it
is
needed
,
that
ground
water
pcp
concentrations
predicted
by
multimed
would
agree
precisely
with
the
resource
damage
data
.
the
resource
damage
incidents
presented
in
the
background
document
are
intended
to
illustrate
that
groundwater
ground
water
contamination
from
pcp
does
occur
at
sawmill
facilities
,
and
are
not
intended
as
validation
points
for
exposure
modeling
.
resource
damage
data
were
obtained
from
monitoring
and
other
wells
that
happened
to
be
in
place
at
a
facility
when
the
sampling
was
conducted
.
there
are
a
number
of
possible
reasons
why
sampling
data
from
the
resource
damage
incidents
may
not
reflect

water

the

,
in
particular
the
location
of
the

with
regard
to
plume

and
groundwater
ground

flow
direction
,
and
the
timing
of
peak
plume
concentrations
at
the
wells
.
the
latter
point
is
especially
important
because
,
depending
on
patterns
of
past
pcp
use
and
the
well
location
,
the
peak
concentration
in
the
plume
may
not
have

or
may
have
passed

.
in
these
resource

cases
,
sufficient
information
was
not
available
to
determine
the
placement
and
design
of
these
wells
with
respect
to
the
sites
hydrogeology
or
possible
plume
locations
and
travel
time
.
thus
,
it
is
not
possible
to
use
these
data
points
for
validation
of
model
results
.
however
,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
modelestimated
model
estimated
groundwater
ground
water
pcp
concentrations
in
the
final
rule
are
similar
to
those
reported
from
resource

.
when
the
revised
average
source
concentration
was
used
in
the
groundwater
ground

model
,
the
estimated
concentrations
for

in

are

a
reasonable
agreement
with
the
values

(

.
one
commenter
disagreed
with
the
use
of
multimed
in
that
it
was
not
as
`
robust
'
or
welltested
well
tested
as
the
monte

based
epacml
model
used
for
the

rule
.
another
commenter
recommends
the
use
of
the
monte
carlo
approach
for
all
input
parameters
in
the
modeling
effort
.
first
,
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
multimed
groundwater
ground
water
model
is
the
same
model
as
used
in
epacml
except
for
the
manner
in
which
input
parameters
are
specified
.
epacml
can
only
be
run
in
a
probabilistic
,
monte
carlo
mode
,
while
multimed
allows
monte
carlo
runs
as
well
as
for
individual
input
parameters
to
be
specified
and
fixed
.
the
groundwater
ground
water
flow
and
transport
model
components
are
the
same
for
multimed
and
epacml
.
second
,
the
agency
did
not
pursue
a
probabilistic
,
monte
carlobased
carlo
based
approach
when
developing
input
parameters
for
this
modeling
effort
due
to
the
fact
that
using
this
sophisticated
technique
requires
knowledge
and
proper
specification
of
input
parameter
distributions
,
and
variable
independence
or
proper
specification
of
joint
probability
parameter
distributions
.
when
these
requirements
cannot
be
met
,
the
monte
carlo
approach
will
not
provide
better
estimates
than
a
scenariobased
scenario
based
approach
.
