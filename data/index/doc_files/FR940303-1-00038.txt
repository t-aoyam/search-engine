eighty

commenters
supported
identifying
mdp
in
the
ingredients
statement
on
the
labels
of
meat
and
poultry
products
in
which
it
is
used
.
these
commenters

1452
consumers
,
8
food
manufacturers
distributors
,
17
food
retailers
,
4
trade
associations
,
4
individuals
,
one
food
consultant
,
and
one
law
firm
representative
.
the
commenters
provided
the
following
general
reasons
why
mdp
should
be
identified
on
a
finished
meat
or
poultry
product
label
.
they
stated
that
:
(
1
)
consumers
have
a
right
to
know
that
mdp
is
present
in
a
product
,
(
2
)
meat
and
poultry
products
should
be
labeled
the
same
,
ie
,
there
should
be
parity
in
labeling
regulations
,
(
3
)
mdp
contains
higher
amounts
of
`
calcium
'
`
cholesterol
'
and
or
`
bone
particles
'
and
,
therefore
,
should
be
identified
,
and
(
4
)
mdp
should
be
identified
because
there
is
`
a
difference
'
between
mdp
and
handdeboned
hand
deboned
poultry
.
the
eight
food
manufacturers
distributors
and
four
consumers
also
stated
that
consumers
should
be
made
aware
(
through
labeling
)
that
mdp
contains
`
kidneys
'
`
sex
glands
'
and
`
lungs
'
the
food
manufacturers
distributors
also
pointed
out
that
mechanical
deboning
processes
that
crush
or
grind
bones
should
be
labeled
as
such
,
regardless
of
kind
(
ie
,
species
.
most
of
the
food
manufacturers
distributors
encouraged
fsis
to
work
with
industrys
scientific
experts
and
the
meat
community
to
define
`
meat
'
and
`
poultry
'
through
standards
of
`
product
safety
and
nutritional
composition
'
the
remaining
1257
commenters
did
not
support
identifying
mdp
in
the
ingredients
statement
on
the
labels
of
finished
meat
and
poultry
products
for
the
following
reasons
:
(
1
)
the
agencys
current
policy
should
continue
and
mdp
has
a
history
of
safe
use
for
25plus
plus
years
without
labeling
it
as
anything
other
than
`
chicken
'
`
turkey
meat
'
etc
,
(

)
nutrition
labeling
will
be
a
means
of
educating
consumers
about
product
composition
and
will
address
any
concerns
with
regard
to
the
nutrient
qualities
of
the
products
they
purchase
,
(
3
)
listing
mdp
separately
in
the
ingredients
statement
would
mislead
consumers
into
thinking
they
are
purchasing
products
that
are
inferior
to
what
they
have
(
historically
)
purchased
,
(
4
)
any
changes
in
labeling
regulations
on
mdp
would
only
serve
to
confuse
consumers
into
believing
something
`
has
been
added
to
their
products
'
when
,
in
fact
,
no
changes
have
been
made
,
and
(

)
a
change
in
labeling
would
result
in
a
severe
negative
economic
impact
`
on
the
entire
poultry
industry
and
us

as
well
as

trading
partners
that
now
use
these
items
as
a
food
source
'
one
food
manufacturer
stated
that
beef
and
pork
are
different
species
with
obvious
differences
in
bone
mass
,
skeletal
size
,
amount
of
calcification
,
and
bone
hardness
,
and
,
therefore
,
mdp
should
not
be
labeled
the
same
as
mss
,
which
incorporates
bone
and
the
constituents
of
bone
in
the
product
.
some
of
the
trade
associations
recommended
that
if
mss

meets
the
same
criteria
for
mdp
in

cfr

,
it
should
be
entitled
to
analogous
labeling
.
some
of
the
trade
associations
also
believe
that
mdp
and
mss
)
should
not
be
defined
by
the
process
used
to
make
them
.
the
academicians
stated
that
the
method
of
removal
of
meat
tissue
from
bones
of
carcasses
should
not
become
part
of
the
name
of
the
product
,
and
,
as
long
as
the
end
products
are
comparable
and
meet
the
`
rules
'
for
starting
materials
,
composition
,
sanitation
,
etc
,
the
method
of
processing
should
not
become
part
of
the
product
name
.
the
commenters
also
stated
that
mdp
is
an
excellent
source
of
protein
and
calcium
.
fsiss
response
to
the
comments
on
the
06/15/1993
,
anpr
and
issues
regarding
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
in
its
06/15/1993
,
anpr
,
fsis
solicited
comments
,
information
,
scientific
data
,
and
recommendations
regarding
the
consideration
of
the
need
for
labeling
of
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
and
products
in
which
such
poultry
product
is
based
.
fsis
did
not
receive
any
new
data
regarding
the
health
and
safety
aspects
of
the
use
of
such
products
,
and
,
therefore
,
fsis
believes
that
there
are
no
new
health
and
safety
concerns
.
although
,
many
of
the
commenters
of
the
06/15/1993
,
anpr
raised
concerns
regarding
the
labeling
of
calcium
and
cholesterol
contents
of
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
,
the
provisions
of
the
nutrition
labeling
regulations
(
58
fr
632
)
published
by
fsis
,
which
are
to
be
effective
07/06/1994
,
would
be
a
means
of
educating
consumers
regarding
certain
nutrients
and
other
components
of
processed
meat
and
poultry
products
containing
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
,
including
calcium
and
cholesterol
.
calcium
and
cholesterol
declaration
becomes
necessary
on
the
labeling
of
most
multiingredient
ingredient
poultry
and
meat
products
upon
the
effective
date
.
these
regulations
also
establish
a
voluntary
nutrition
labeling
program
for
singleingredient
single
ingredient
,
raw
products
,
and
specify
that
fsis
will
evaluate
significant
participation
of
the
voluntary
program
.
if
significant
participation
is
not
found
,
fsis
shall
initiate
rulemaking
to
require
nutrition
labeling
on
those
products
under
the
voluntary
program
.
therefore
,
with
certain
exceptions
,
consumers
will
have
complete
information
about
the
nutrients
in
poultry
products
.
such
information
will
ensure
that
consumers
are
not
mislead
about
the
composition
of
products
containing
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
