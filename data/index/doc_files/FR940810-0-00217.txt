for
the
purpose
of
regulation
,
the
mineral
must
be
one
of
the
six
minerals
covered
and
must
be
in
the
asbestos
growth
habit
.
large
specimen
samples
of
asbestos
generally
have
the
gross
appearance
of
wood
.
fibers
are
easily
parted
from
it
.
asbestos
fibers
are
very
long
compared
with
their
widths
.
the
fibers
have
a
very
high
tensile
strength
as
demonstrated
by
bending
without
breaking
.
asbestos
fibers
exist
in
bundles
that
are
easily
parted
,
show
longitudinal
fine
structure
and
may
be
tufted
at
the
ends
showing
`
bundle
of
sticks
'
morphology
.
in
the
microscope
some
of
these
properties
may
not
be
observable
.
amphiboles
do
not
always
show
striations
along
their
length
even
when
they
are
asbestos
.
neither
will
they
always
show
tufting
.
they
generally
do
not
show
a
curved
nature
except
for
very
long
fibers
.
asbestos
and
asbestiform
minerals
are
usually
characterized
in
groups
by
extremely
high
aspect
ratios
(
greater
than
1001
.
while
aspect
ratio
analysis
is
useful
for
characterizing
populations
of
fibers
,
it
cannot
be
used
to
identify
individual
fibers
of
intermediate
to
short
aspect
ratio
.
observation
of
many
fibers
is
often
necessary
to
determine
whether
a
sample
consists
of
`
cleavage
fragments
'
or
of
asbestos
fibers
.
most
cleavage
fragments
of
the
asbestos
minerals
are
easily
distinguishable
from
true
asbestos
fibers
.
this
is
because
true
cleavage
fragments
usually
have
larger
diameters
than
1
&
mum
.
internal
structure
of
particles
larger
than
this
usually
shows
them
to
have
no
internal
fibrillar
structure
.
in
addition
,
cleavage
fragments
of
the
monoclinic
amphiboles
show
inclined
extinction
under
crossed
polars
with
no
compensator
.
asbestos
fibers
usually
show
extinction
at
zero
degrees
or
ambiguous
extinction
if
any
at
all
.
morphologically
,
the
larger
cleavage
fragments
are
obvious
by
their
blunt
or
stepped
ends
showing
prismatic
habit
.
also
,
they
tend
to
be
acicular
rather
than
filiform
.
where
the
particles
are
less
than
1
&
mum
in
diameter
and
have
an
aspect
ratio
greater
than
or
equal
to
31
,
it
is
recommended
that
the
sample
be
analyzed
by
sem
or
tem
if
there
is
any
question
whether
the
fibers
are
cleavage
fragments
or
asbestiform
particles
.
care
must
be
taken
when
analyzing
by
electron
microscopy
because
the
interferences
are
different
from
those
in
light
microscopy
and
may
structurally
be
very
similar
to
asbestos
.
the
classic
interference
is
between
anthophyllite
and
biopyribole
or
intermediate
fiber
.
use
the
same
morphological
clues
for
electron
microscopy
as
are
used
for
light
microscopy
,
eg
.
fibril
splitting
,
internal
longitudinal
striation
,
fraying
,
curvature
,
etc
.

gross

the

,
preferably

determine
the

of

a

determine
whether
any

determine
the

may
be
carried
out

augmented
