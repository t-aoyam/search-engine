the

the
specific

to

[

are

below
.
the
commission
requests
comment
on
the
need
for
an
allornone
all
or
none
or
oddlot
odd
lot
order
exception
and
a
general
exemptive
provision
.
exception
for
allornone
all
or
none
orders
the
proposed
rule
includes
an
exception
for
allornone
all
or
none
customer
limit
orders
[
paragraph
(
b2
.
an
allornone
all
or
none
customer
limit
order
is
defined
in
paragraph
(
c1
)
as
one
that
carries
a
condition
that
instructs
the
market
maker
to
execute
all
of
the
shares
in
the
order
only
if
it
can
be
done
all
at
once
.
the
purpose
of
this
exception
is
to
prevent
delays
in
executing
other
orders
that
a
market
maker
may
be
receiving
at
the
time
the
market
maker
is
handling
the
allornone
all
or
none
order
.
in
the
example
above
,
the
customers
limit
order
for
1000
shares
of
stock
could
be
filled
in
several
separate
transactions
.
with
an
allornone
all
or
none
order
,
a
market
maker
must
execute
all
the
shares
of
the
order
in
a
single
trade
.
the
market
maker
may
not
have
immediate
access
to
that
number
of
shares
.
in
the
meantime
,
other
orders
may
be
received
that
require
the
market
maker
to
purchase
shares
from
other
market
makers
or
their
customers
.
without
this
exception
,
the
market
maker
would
not
be
able
to
buy
any
stock
at
less
than
the
allornone
all
or
none
limit
order
price
and
,
ultimately
,
the
execution
quality
of
other
customer
orders
would
suffer
.
thus
,
using
the
above
example
,
the
exception
would
permit
a
market
maker
handling
an
allornone
all
or
none
order
to
purchase
shares
in
the
security
for
its
own
account
at
$
20
1/4
or
lower
without
filling
the
customers
limit
order
,
but
only
for
amounts
smaller
than
the
1000
shares
in
the
allornone
all
or
none
order
.
the
market
maker
could
not
,
however
,
purchase
1000
shares
or
more
at
$
20
1/4
or
lower
for
its
own
account
without
satisfying
the
customer
limit
order
.
