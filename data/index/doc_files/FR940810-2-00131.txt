is
intended
to
prevent
investment
companies
from
issuing
excessive
amounts
of
senior
securities
and
thereby
increasing
unduly
the
speculative
character
of
their
junior
securities
,
or
from
operating
without
adequate
assets
or
reserves
.
the
proposed
multiple
class
plan
does
not
involve
borrowings
,
and
does
not
affect
the
funds
'
existing
assets
or
reserves
.
in
addition
,
the
proposed
arrangement
will
not
increase
the
speculative
character
of
the
shares
of
the
funds
,
since
each
class
of
shares
will
participate
in
all
of
the
funds

appreciation
or
depreciation
(
if
any

and
all
of
a

expenses
(
with
the
exception
of
the
plan
payments
and
class
expenses

.
applicants
believe
that
the
proposed
allocation
of
class
expenses
in
the
manner
described
above
,
and
the
voting
rights
relating
to
the
rule
12b1
plans
and
shareholder
service
plans
are
equitable
and
would
not
discriminate
unfairly
against
any
group
of
shareholders
.
because
,
with
respect
to
any
fund
,
the
rights
and
privileges
of
each
class
of
shares
are
substantially
identical
,
the
possibility
that
their
interests
would
ever
conflict
would
be
remote
.
in
any
event
,
the
interests
of
the
affected
shareholders
with
respect
to
distribution
and
or
service
fees
would
be
adequately
protected
since
the
distribution
and
service
plans
for
each
of
those
classes
will
conform
to
the
requirements
of
rule
12b1
(
except
that
a
shareholder
service
plan
may
not
confer
certain
voting
rights
,
including
the
requirement
that
their
implementation
and
continuance
be
approved
on
an
annual
basis
by
both
the
full
board
and
the
noninterested
interested
directors
of

of
the
act

and
rule
22c1
thereunder
to
the
extent
necessary
to
permit
the
funds
to
offer
shares
subject
to
a
cdsc
.
applicants
believe
that
implementation
of
the
cdsc
in
the
manner
and
under
the
circumstances
described
above
would
be
fair
and
in
the
best
interests
of

and
would
be
appropriate
in
the
public
interest

fairly
intended
