the

during

two

suggested
revising

so
that
presidential
primary
candidates
would
only
receive
matching
funds
for
contributions
exceeding
$
200
containing
complete
contributor
information

)
for
additional
submissions
for
matching
funds
.
accordingly
,
comments
are
requested
on
whether
to
delete
section
90362b1v
,
thereby
requiring
complete
contributor
information
for
all
matchable
contributions
exceeding
$
200
.
in
the
alternative
,
comments
are
sought
on
only
matching
these
contributions
if
committees
can
provide
evidence
demonstrating
they
made
their
best
efforts
to
obtain
the
information
.
please
note

neither

the
proposed
regulations

follow

noco
statements
section
90345a
)
of
the
regulations
requires
the
candidate
to
submit
a
statement
of
net
outstanding
campaign
obligations
[
noco
]
within
15
days
of
his
or
her
date
of
ineligibility
.
section
90345f1
)
also
requires
the
candidate
to
submit
a
revised
statement
of
net
outstanding
campaign
obligations
with
each
subsequent
matching
payment
request
.
these
noco
statements
provide
the
commission
with
an
indication
of
the
campaigns
financial
status
.
the
commission
uses
these
statements
to
determine
whether
the
candidate
is
entitled
to
receive
any
additional
matching
funds
.
in
some
circumstances
,
the
noco
statements
do
not
provide
adequate
information
about
the
candidates
remaining
obligations
.
for
example
,
many
noco
statements
list
the
candidates
estimated
necessary
winding
down
costs
as
a
single
lump
sum
,
making
it
difficult
for
the
commission
to
review
the
cost
estimate
to
determine
whether
the
candidate
is
entitled
to
receive
the
entire
estimated
amount
.
in
addition
,
because
several
weeks
now
elapse
between
submission
of
the
noco
statement
and
certification
of
the
matching
payments
due
to
changes
in
the
treasury
departments
payment
policy
,
the
certification
often
does
not
reflect
the
true
financial
status
of
the
committee
at
the
time
of
certification
.
the
candidates
financial
situation
invariably
changes
during
this
period
,
and
any
change
in
the
committees
net
outstanding
campaign
obligations
should
result
in
a
change
in
the
committees
entitlement
.
the
proposed
rule
seeks
to
address
these
problems
.
section
90345b
)
would
be
amended
to
require
a
breakdown
of
the
estimated
winding
down
costs
listed
on
the
noco
statement
by
category
and
time
period
.
this
breakdown
would
include
estimates
of
quarterly
or
monthly
costs
for
office
space
rental
,
staff
salaries
,
office
supplies
,
equipment
rental
,
telephone
expenses
,
postage
and
other
mailing
costs
,
printing
,
and
storage
from
the
date
of
the
noco
statement
until
the
expected
termination
of
the
committees
political
activity
.
the
proposed
rule
would
also
require
a
candidate
who
submits
a
matching
payment
request
and
accompanying
noco
statement
after
his
or
her
date
of
ineligibility
to
submit
an
additional
revised
noco
statement
.
this
statement
would
be
due
just
before
the
certification
date
,
on
a
date
that
would
be
published
by
the
commission
with
the
dates
for
matching
fund
submissions
and
matching
payment
certifications
.
the
candidate
would
be
required
to
prepare
the
statement
so
that
it
reflects
the
financial
status
of
the
campaign
three
business
days
before
the
statements
due
date
.
the
commission
would
then
use
this
statement
to
determine
whether
the
amount
of
matching
payments
to
be
certified
should
be
adjusted
to
reflect
a
committees
changed
financial
situation
.
this
would
ensure
that
the
amount
certified
accurately
reflects
the
committees
financial
situation
at
the
time
of
certification
.
the
commission
welcomes
comments
on
these
proposed
rules
.
