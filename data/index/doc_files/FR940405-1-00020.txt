the

authority

,
recently
notified
the
faa
that
an

transport
canada
aviation
advises
that
three
field
reports
indicate
that
the
electrical
power
supplies
of
the
white
anticollision
collision
lights
may
develop
a
fault
which
produces
greater
than
normal
electrical
emissions
.
the
cause
of
this
fault
has
been
attributed
to
a
capacitor
failure
in
some
`
grimes
'
strobe
light
systems
.
this
electromagnetic
interference
can
adversely
affect
the
operation
of
the
proximity
switch
electronics
unit
(
pseu
)
and
its
associated
systems
.
the
following
occurrences
have
resulted
:
1
.
flashing
of
the
landing
gear

during
cruise
;
2

incorrect
operation
of
the

and

may
interfere
with
or
distract
the
flight
crew
in
carrying
out
its
regular
duties
during
flight
or
on
the
ground
,
and
thus
serve
to
compromise
the
safe
operation
of

classified
these
service
bulletins
as
mandatory
and
issued
canadian
airworthiness
directive
cf9320
,
dated
08/03/1993
,
in
order
to
assure
the
continued
airworthiness
of
these
airplanes
in
canada
.
this
airplane
model
is
manufactured
in
canada
and
is
type
certificated
for
operation
in
the
united
states
under
the
provisions
of
§
21
29
of
the
federal
aviation
regulations
and
the
applicable
bilateral
airworthiness
agreement
.
pursuant
to
this
bilateral
airworthiness
agreement
,
transport
canada
aviation
has
kept
the
faa
informed
of
the
situation
described
above
.
the
faa
has
examined
the
findings
of
transport
canada
aviation
,
reviewed
all
available
information
,
and
determined
that
ad
action
is
necessary
for
products
of
this
type
design
that
are
certificated
for
operation
in
the
united
states
.
since
an
unsafe
condition
has
been
identified
that
is
likely
to
exist
or
develop
on
other
airplanes
of
the
same
type
design
registered
in
the
united
states
,
the
proposed
ad
would
require
revising
the
limitations
section
of
the
faaapproved
faa
approved
airplane
flight
manual
(
afm
)
to
advise
flight
crew
members
that
certain
cockpit
indications
during
inflight
in
flight
or
ground
operations
may
reveal
faulty
anticollision
collision
strobe
light
units
,
and
to
provide
procedures
for
subsequent
flight
crew
action
.
this
proposal
would
also
require
replacement
of
faulty
`
grimes
'
units
with
new
or
serviceable
`
grimes
'
units
or
installation
of
the
new
`
whelan
'
system
(
modification
8/1273
.
the
proposed
ad
would
also
require
eventual
replacement
of
the
existing
anticollision
collision
strobe
light
system
with
the
`
whelen
'
anticollision
collision
strobe
light
system
(
modification
8/1273
)
at
all
three
locations
.
when
accomplished
,
incorporation
of
this
modification
would
constitute
terminating
action
for
the
requirements
of
this
proposal
.
following
incorporation
of
modification
8/1273
,
operators
would
be
permitted
to
remove
the
proposed
changes
to
the
afm
.
the
actions
would
be
required
to
be
accomplished
in
accordance
with
the
service
bulletins
described
previously
.
additionally
,
applicability
of
the
proposed
rule
would
exclude
those
airplanes
on
which
modification
8/1273
has
been
accomplished
previously
,
since
airplanes
so
modified
are
not
subject
to
the
unsafe
condition
addressed
by
this
proposed

the

that
it

and
that

required
parts
for

of
modification
8/1273
at

would

to
be

or

the

discussed
above
is
based
on
assumptions
that
no
operator
has
yet
accomplished
any
of
the
proposed
requirements
of
this

action
,
and
that
no
operator
would
accomplish
those
actions
in
the
future
if
this

were
not

the

therefore
,
in

with
executive
order
12612
,
it
is
determined
that
this
proposal
would
not
have
sufficient
federalism
