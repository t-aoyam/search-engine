received
from
more
than
90

.
epa
has
considered
all
of

comments
.
based
on
these
comments
,
epa
is
including
in
this

changes
in
a
number
of
areas
of
the
pcb
regulations
that
were
not
addressed
in
the

.
several
commenters
submitted
information
concerning
the
toxicity
of
pcbs
and
the
methods
used
by
epa
to
determine
exposure
to
pcbs
.
epa
is
currently
conducting
a
review
of
the
toxicity
and
mechanisms
of
action
associated
with
pcbs
and
several
structurally
related
chemicals
.
this
review
may
not
be
complete
until

the
outcome
of
the
toxicity

waste
minimization
and
combustion
strategy
on
05/18/1993
,
epa
announced
a
draft
strategy
to
address
waste
minimization
and
combustion
of
hazardous
waste
under
rcra
.
the
strategy
is
designed
to
stimulate
a
broad
national
dialogue
on
how
:
(
1
)
to
better
integrate
waste
minimization
into
epas
hazardous
waste
management
program
.
(
2
)
to
determine
the
appropriate
role
of
combustion
in
that
program
.
(
3
)
to
ensure
that
hazardous
waste
combustion
standards
are
fully
protective
of
human
health
and
the
environment
.
the
draft
strategy
sets
forth
a
series
of
short
-
and
longterm
long
term
activities
that
epa
would
undertake
in
pursuing
these
three
areas
,
among
which
are
rulemakings
to
address
technical
standards
for
hazardous
waste
combustion
and
public
participation
in
the
rcra
permitting
process
.
the
draft
strategy
also
sets
forth
epas
intention
to
use
rcras
casebycase
case
by
case
omnibus
permitting
authority
where
necessary
to
protect
health
and
the
environment
,
and
to
impose
upgraded
permit
conditions
in
newly
issued
permits
.
in
addition
to
other
potential
areas
,
these
permit
conditions
may
address
emissions
of
dioxins
,
furans
,
and
particulate
matter
.
finally
,
the
draft
strategy
announced
epas
intentions
over
the
succeeding
18
months
to
give
permitting
priority
to
existing
,
operating
rcra
combustion
units
.
the
pcb
program
under
tsca
is
different
from
rcra
in
several
aspects
.
the
manufacture
of
pcbs
is
generally
banned
,
and
the
use
of
pcbs
is
heavily
restricted
.
therefore
,
any
disposal
issues
are
limited
to
a
finite
,
although
widely
dispersed
,
universe
.
the
pcb
program
mandates
the
burning
of
certain
highrisk
high
risk
wastes
.
it
also
allows
wastes
,
such
as
low
concentration
liquids
and
drained
transformer
carcasses
,
with
a
lower
potential
risk
of
exposure
,
to
be
disposed
of
in
other
types
of
combustion
units
(
eg
,
industrial
boilers
)
to
provide
disposal
capacity
.
epa
proposes
to
make
the
following
adjustments
in
the
pcb
disposal
program
under
tsca
in
response
to
issues
raised
in
the
combustion
strategy
.
for
fixedsite
fixed
site
incinerators
,
approval
conditions
(
for
new
units
or
at
the
time
of
renewal
)
would
be
adjusted
to
reflect
new
standards
and
procedural
requirements
adopted
under
rcra
.
for
mobile
incinerators
,
approval
conditions
(
for
new
units
or
at
the
time
of
renewal
)
would
be
adjusted
to
reflect
new
standards
and
procedural
requirements
adopted
under
rcra
where
applicable
.
unique
to
the
pcb
disposal
program
under
tsca
is
the
concept
of
mobile
incinerators
.
a
single
multiyear
year
approval
,
that
imposes
the
same
technical
standards
applicable
to
fixedsite
fixed
site
incinerators
,
is
issued
to
these
units
.
state
and
local
governments
receive
prior
notification
and
can
impose
additional
restrictions
on
the
mobile
units
using
their
own
authorities
.
the
tsca
approval
generally
limits
the
operating
time
at
any
one
site
unless
additional
assessment
of
risk
and
public
notice
are
conducted
.
however
,
epa
has
not
adopted
sitespecific
site
specific
risk
assessments
and
public
participation
in
the
permit
development
process
for
mobile
incinerators
because
epa
and
the
public
would
lose
the
considerable
benefits
derived
from
mobile
disposal
units
considering
these
units
allow
only
minimal
exposure
due
to
their
high
destruction
efficiency
and
limited
operating
time
at
each
site
.
the
current
industrial
boiler
rules
at
40
cfr
761
60
)
and
761
60
)
and
industrial
furnace
rules
,
proposed
at
761
60
,
limit
both
the
concentration
and
volume
of
pcbs
which
can
be
treated
in
these
units
.
industrial
boilers
and
furnaces
are
units
that
were
built
to
perform
other
functions
such
as
power
generation
or
materials
recycling
,
with
the
combustion
of
pcbs
and
hazardous
wastes
as
a
secondary
function
.
the
primary
function
poses
a
separate
risk
which
should
be
considered
when
addressing
the
overall
risk
posed
by
the
combustion
of
low
concentration
,
low
volume
pcbs
in
industrial
boilers
and
furnaces
.
therefore
,
epa
proposes
to
impose
uniform
technologybased
technology
based
standards
,
instead
of
sitespecific
site
specific
permit
conditions
,
on
industrial
boilers
and
furnaces
due
to
the
low
risk
posed
from
the
combustion
of
low
concentration
,
low
volume
pcbs
and
because
these
units
are
constructed
and
operated
for
other
purposes
.
epa
specifically
requests
comment
on
how
best
to
implement
the
combustion
strategy
given
the
controls
already
imposed
,
or
proposed
in
this
rulemaking
on
the
quantities
and
concentrations
of
pcbs
which
can
be
disposed
of
in
industrial
boilers
and
furnaces
.
epa
believes
that
the
regulations
that
currently
apply
to
pcbs
,
along
with
those
proposed
,
are
sufficient
under
tsca
to
protect
the
public
and
the
environment
from
unreasonable
risk
of
injury
.
although
epas
05/18/1993
,
draft
strategy
on
waste
minimization
and
combustion
of
waste
extends
only
to
rcra
hazardous
wastes
,
its
overall
objectives
were
carefully
considered
in
the
development
of
this
proposed
rule
.
epa
requests
comment
on
its
overall
plan
for
implementing
the
agencys

strategy
for
the

program
under

under
several
statutes

epa
.
in
particular
,

.
in
an
effort
to
harmonize
standards
for
the

under
both

,
epa
is
today
proposing

summary
of
proposal
consistent
with
these
authorities
described
in
unit
ie
,
epa
is
proposing
a
number
of
modifications
to
the
pcb
disposal
rules
to
provide
flexibility
in
addressing
the
disposal
of
pcbs
where
specific
conditions
would
allow
for
different
waste
management
activities
than
are
currently
available
under
the
regulations
,
while
still
providing
protection
from
unreasonable
risk
of
injury
.
epa
is
also
proposing
modifications
to
the
disposal
regulations
that
would
allow
for
the
recognition
of
pcb
waste
management
activities
undertaken
under
other
federal
or
state
authorities
.
furthermore
,
epa
is
proposing
a
number
of
changes
to
the
regulations
to
delete

out
of

provisions
,
modify
the
regulations
to
address

,
make
certain

provisions
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
other
federal
statutes
,
and
reduce
requirements
for
pcb
disposal
activities
which
present
a
de
minimis
risk
.
finally
,
epa
is
proposing
certain
authorizations
and
exemptions
which
would
address
the
need
for
the
scientific
community
to
conduct
research
as
well
as
health
and
environmental
studies
on
pcbs
and
on
media
contaminated
by
pcbs
(
to
include
processing
and
distribution
in
commerce
of
pcbs
)
for
the
development
of
innovative
disposal
technologies
which
otherwise
would
require
issuance
of
a
disposal
approval
.
the
topics
to
be
addressed
through
this
proposed
rulemaking
include
the
16
issues
identified
in
the

plus
a
number
of
additional
issues
that
have

background
.
the
current
pcb
regulations
generally
establish
a
concentration
of
50
parts
per
million
(
ppm
)
as
the
regulatory
threshold
for
authorized
pcbs
in
use
(
ie
,
in
service
.
this
was
based
,
in
part
,
on
the
economic
impact
of
the
regulations
on
electrical
transformers
,
but
50
ppm
has
been
extended
to
include
all
authorized
pcbs
and
pcb
articles
,
as
defined
in
these
proposed
rules
at
7613
,
unless
otherwise
noted
(
eg
,
pcb
concentration
of
less
than
50
ppm
resulting
from
dilution
.
where
liquid
samples
could
not
be
collected
,
such
as
on
contaminated
surfaces
,
surface
sampling
and
concentration
levels
were
developed
(
see
part

,
subpart
g
,
the
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
.
the
surface
concentrations
,
which
were
based
on
dermal
exposure
,
were
equated
to
the
existing
pcb
regulations
which
included
economic
considerations
.
as
a
result
,
the
regulations
established
for
pcbs
at
concentrations
of
50
to
less
than
500
ppm
were
applied
to
contaminated
surfaces
at
concentrations
of
greater
than
10
to
less
than
100
micrograms
per
100
square
centimeters
(

.
the
regulations
that
epa
is
proposing
,
in
several
sections
of
this
notice
,
codify
the
relationship
between
surface
contamination
and
the
existing
regulations
based
on
milligrams
of
pcbs
per
liter
of
liquid
on
a
dry
weight
basis
.
in
the
anprm
,
epa
requested
comments
on
the
effectiveness
of
the
current
pcb
regulations
in
preventing
an
unreasonable
risk
of
injury
to
health
and
the
environment
from
the
disposal
of
`
large
volume
,
nonliquid
liquid
pcb
wastes
'
such
as
wastes
from
the
shredding
of
automobiles
,
white
goods
,
and
industrial
scrap
,
and
certain
classes
of
soils
,
sludges
,
and
sediments
.
currently
,
large
volume
wastes
derived
from
an
authorized
original
source
containing
50
ppm
pcbs
may
only
be
disposed
of
in
an
incinerator
that
complies
with
40

,
in
a
chemical
waste
landfill
that
complies

or
pursuant
to
an
approved
alternate
method
of

,
regardless
of
their
current
pcb
concentration
or
the
risk
of
exposure
they
may
pose
.
the
agency
believes
that
there
are
additional
disposal
methods
and
other
waste
management
techniques
for
large
volume
wastes
that
would
not
pose
an
unreasonable
risk
of
injury
to
health
and
the
environment
.
these
additional
disposal
methods
and
other
waste
management
techniques
are
the
subject
of
this
section
of
todays
proposed
rule
.
for
different
kinds
of
large
volume
waste
,
such
as
soils
,
liquids
,
and
surfaces
contaminated
with
pcbs
,
epa
is
proposing
several
selfimplementing
self
implementing
disposal
options
at
761

,
761
62
and
761
79
.
if
followed
exactly
as
written
,
the
selfimplementing
self
implementing
disposal
options
would
not
require
prior
approval
from
epa
.
these
options
are
detailed
and
specific
.
the

of
the
selfimplementing
self

placement
of
the

provide
better
continuity
and
should
facilitate
understanding
of
the
overall
selfimplementing
self

procedures
of
which
they
are
a
part
.
the
term
`
large
volume
'
is
used
to
describe
wastes
that
,
in
general
,
are
generated
or
managed
in
greater
volumes
than
when
they
were
originally
placed
in

not
be
authorized
for

would
not
include
wastes
that
are

large

pcb
wastes
would
not
include
the
more
traditional
pcb
wastes
which
are
typically
generated
and
managed
in
discrete
,
relatively
small
volumes
associated
with
individual
pieces
of
electrical
,
mechanical
,
heat

large

pcb
wastes
are
frequently
heterogenous
in

and
contaminated
with
low
(
ie
,
&
lt
;
50
ppm
)
or
varying
levels
of
pcbs
and
other
constituents
.
although
these
wastes
may
now
pose
little
environmental
risk
,
under
the
current
pcb
regulations
,
they
are
usually
required
to
be
disposed
of
,
based
on
their
original
pcb
concentration
,
in
either
a
tsca
chemical
waste
landfill
or
tsca

second
,
as
the
name
of
the
category
implies
,
`
large

'
wastes
may
be
generated
each
year
in
enormous
amounts
.
however
,
the
actual
magnitude
of
the
problem
is
not
well
documented
.
epa
requested
information
about
historic
pcb
disposal
sites
,
including
areas
of
major
or
longterm
spills
(
46
fr
22144
,
04/15/1981
)
and
included
these
data
in
its
listing
of
sites
known
as
the
comprehensive
environmental
response
,
compensation
and
liability
act
information
system
or
cerclis
.
while
epa
does
not
have
information
characterizing
every
site
where
pcbs
were
spilled
or
disposed
of
,
the
agency
does
have
estimates
of
the
number
of
sites
contaminated
with
pcbs
.
in
1991
,
epas
office
of
emergency
and
remedial
response
completed
a
characterization
of
1218
sites
associated
with
the
national
priorities
list
(
npl
)
and
29461
sites
associated
with
cerclis
.
at
approximately
20
percent
of
the
npl
sites
and
approximately
7
percent
of
the
cerclis
sites
,
pcbs
were
characterized
as
a
`
predominant
'
waste
type
.
the
npl
sites
alone
contain
approximately
34070000
cubic
yards
of
material
contaminated
with
pcbs
and
other
substances
.
similarly
,
the
weight
of
shredder
waste
produced
annually
by
metal
recyclers
is
approximately
3
million
tons
.
commercial
disposal
costs
of
these
types
of
large
volume
wastes
at
pcb
incinerators
or
landfills
have
been
as
high
as
$
2300
per
cubic
yard
for
incineration
,
and
$
550
per
cubic
yard
for
chemical
waste
landfilling
.
based
on
this
information
concerning
large
volume
pcb
waste
generation
,
the
number
of
old
pcb
disposal
sites
,
and
the
cost
of
disposal
,
epa
believes
that
it
is
appropriate
to
commence
rulemaking
to
address
the
management
and
disposal
of
large
volume
pcb
wastes
and
propose
alternatives
to
the
current
available
disposal
options
.
therefore
,
for
pcb
remediation
wastes
,
epa
is
proposing
to
allow
alternatives
to
the
regulatory
mandate
that
pcb
wastes
must
be
managed

some

would
provide

commenters
suggested
several
potentially
viable
alternatives
for

,
some
of
which
were
not
listed
in

some
commenters
suggested
that
the
need
to
obtain
a
disposal
permit
was
an
impediment
to
developing
and
utilizing
alternative
methods
of

and
containment
.
epas
position
is
that
adequate
controls
must
be
imposed
to
ensure
the
safety
of
all
disposal
technologies
,
especially
those
being
operated
on
a
commercial
scale

epa
does
,
however
,
anticipate
that
as
individual
or
combinations
of

are
used
repeatedly
,
the
permitting
process
will
become
streamlined
.
once
out

will
receive

how

in

on

strongly
supported
the
idea
of
developing
an

those
commenters
suggested
that
such
a

could
achieve
considerable
benefits
at

,
similar
to
those
that
have
been
obtained
for

in

of
these
comments
,
and
in
consideration
of
the
agencys
experience
with
implementing

how

in

proposing

was
identified
as
an

a
.
background
.
as
part
of
the
development
of
the
1987
tsca
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
,
epa
evaluated
the
frequency
,
amount
,
and
nature
of
pcb
spills
from
electrical
equipment
,
the
different
routes
of
exposure
to
pcbs
(
ie
,
ingestion
,
dermal
,
and
inhalation
,
the
risks
posed
by
spills
in
different
locations
,
and
the
costs
of
cleanup
.
after
evaluating
this
information
and
considering
a
spill
cleanup
proposal
submitted
to
epa
by
the
environmental
defense
fund
(
edf
,
the
natural
resources
defense
council
(
nrdc
,
the
edison
electric
institute
(
eei
,
the
chemical
manufacturers
association
(
cma
,
and
the
national
electrical
manufacturers
association
(
nema
,
epa
developed
cleanup
goals
for
pcbs
in
soil
and
on
surfaces
.
the
tsca
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
requires
cleanup
of
pcbs
to
different
levels
depending
upon
spill
location
,
the
potential
for
exposure
to
residual
pcbs
remaining
after
cleanup
,
the
concentration
of
pcbs
initially
spilled
(
high
concentration
or
low
,
and
the
nature
and
size
of
the
population
potentially
at
risk
of
exposure
to
residual
pcbs
.
thus
,
the
tsca
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
applies
the
most
stringent
requirements
for
pcb
spill
cleanup
to
nonrestricted
restricted
access
areas
where
there
is
a
greater
potential
for
human
exposures
to
spilled
pcbs
.
the
tsca
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
applies
less
stringent
requirements
for
cleanup
of
pcb
spills
in
restricted
access
areas
where
the
nature
and
degree
of
human
contact
present
a
lower
potential
for
significant
exposure
.
finally
,
even
less
stringent
requirements
apply
to
restricted
access
areas
where
there
is
little
potential
for
human
exposures
.
implementation
of
the
1987
tsca
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
has
,
in
epas
estimation
,
yielded
highly
favorable
environmental
results
.
large
numbers
of
pcb
spills
have
been
cleaned
up
expeditiously
and
safely
with
minimum
administrative
burdens
to
regulatory
agencies
or
responsible
parties
.
this
success
is
in
large
part
attributable
to
the
selfimplementing
self
implementing
nature
of
the
policy
;
the
clear
,
numeric
cleanup
goals
specified
in
the
policy
;
and
the
straightforward
sampling
and
notification
procedures
required
of
those
responding
to
pcb
spills
.
although
the
1987
policy
was
intended
to
be
applicable
to
`
new
'
spills
of
pcbs
,
the
policy
has
also
been
used
in
the
cleanup
of
historic
spills
,
particularly
in
the
context
of
cercla
remediations
.
as
discussed
below
,
since
1990
the
superfund
program
has
adopted
an
approach
to
cleanup
of
pcbs
that
relies
heavily
on
the
1987
tsca
policy
.
although
the
cercla
(
and
rcra
)
remedial
process
generates
large
volumes
of
sitespecific
site
specific
information
that
can
be
used
to
`
fine
tune
'
cleanup
decisions
for
pcbs
,
as
well
as
other
hazardous
substances
,
it
has
been
the
agencys
experience
that
the
essential
features
of
the
1987
tsca
policy
are
workable
and
yield
protective
cleanup
results
for
historic
spills
of
pcbs
.
the
following
discussion
summarizes
the
approach
that
the
cercla
program
has
taken
in
adapting
the
1987
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy

these

are
also
used

for

of
developing

the

explain
that

does
not
mean
that

rather
,
once
the
cercla
program
decides
that

at
a

,
the
prgs
for

should
be
used
to
identify

according
to
the

the
concentration
of
concern
for

differs
depending
on
the
type
of

is
expected
(

point
out
that

specific

may
warrant

factors

proposed
approach
for

.
in
the
07/27/1990
,
proposed
rcra
corrective
action
rule
,
55
fr
30798
,
epa
introduced
the
concept
of
`
action
levels
'
as
trigger
levels
for
further
study
and
subsequent
remediation
at
rcra
facilities
.
in
the
rcra
corrective
action
program
,
a
remedial
investigation
may
indicate
that
levels
of
contamination
from
a
past
release
are
unlikely
to
present
a
threat
to
health
and
the
environment
.
epa
proposed
that
measured
levels
in
the
environment
be
compared
to
action
levels
,
and
that
in
situations
where
measured
levels
are
below
action
levels
,
epa
would
not
normally
require
either
further
study
(
ie
,
a

)
or

.
in
the
proposed

epa
proposed
using

promulgated
under

safe

act
as
action
levels
for

.
for

media
(
including

)
and
for
constituents
in
ground
water
that
do
not
have
established
mcls
,
the
following
criteria
were
proposed
for
establishing
action
levels
.
first
,
the
concentration
for
a
hazardous
constituent
must
be
derived
in
a
manner
consistent
with
agency
guidelines
for
risk
assessment
.
second
,
the
studies
used
to
derive
action
levels
must
be
scientifically
valid
.
third
,
the
concentrations
used
as
action
levels
would
be
(
for
carcinogens
)
associated
with
a
1
10
-
6
upperbound
excess
cancer
risk
for
class
a
and
b
carcinogens
(
pcbs
are

carcinogens
,
and
a
1
10
-
5
risk
level
for

c
carcinogens

for
systemic
toxicants
,
the
action
level
would
be
a
concentration
to
which
humans
could
be
exposed
on
a
daily
basis
without
appreciable
risk
of
adverse
effects
during
a
lifetime
.
the
exposure
scenario
used
for
calculating
the
action
levels
was
direct
contact
(
ie
,
ingestion
,
assuming
residential
land
use
.
epas
proposal
included
in

)
a
separate
provision
establishing
criteria
for
establishing
action
levels
for
soil
,
assuming
exposure
through
consumption
of
the
soil
contaminated
with
a
hazardous
constituent
.
however
,
epa
proposed
to
make
an
exception
to
this
approach
where
epa
has
already
established
standards
for
remediation
of
spilled
pcbs
under
the
tsca
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
.
in
the
preamble
,
epa
explained
that
the
agency
had
determined
that
the
standards
in
the
tsca
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
should
be
used
as
action
levels
and
cleanup
standards
for
soil
in

proposed
appendix
a
,
to

,
subpart
s
,
provided
examples
of
concentration
levels
that
meet
the
above
criteria
for
action
levels
for
more
than
150
hazardous
constituents
.
however
,
epa
erred
in
setting
out
the
concentration
level
for
pcbs
in
soil
in
appendix
a
(
55
fr
30867
.
epa
had
intended
to
list
1
ppm
,
the
cleanup
goal
recommended
by
the
tsca
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
for
residential
land
use
,
as
the
action
level
for
pcbs
.
instead
the
action
level
listed
in
appendix
a
for
pcbs
in
soil
was
0
09
ppm
.
epa
is
requesting
comment
on
correcting
this
erroneous
listing
.
epa
believes
that
adding
the
following
clarifying
language
to
the
end
of
264
521
:
`
action
levels
for
pcbs
in
soils
shall
be
defined
as
1
ppm
consistent
with
the
tsca
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
at
part
761
subpart
g
'
would
correct
the
error
.
epa
believes
that
it
is
appropriate
to
adopt
the
tsca
1
ppm
level
for
pcbs
as
the
action
level
for
use
under
the
rcra
corrective
action
program
.
as
previously
discussed
,
1
ppm
is
the
cleanup
goal
recommended
by
the
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
for
residential
land
use
.
thus
,
the
tsca
spill
cleanup
level
is
approximately
one
order
of
magnitude
greater
than
the
action
level
identified
in
the
subpart
s
preamble
.
however
,
the
agency
believes
that
adopting
the
1
ppm
level
for
rcra
may
be
appropriate
,
for
several
reasons
.
for
one
thing
,
the
1
ppm
tsca
level
is
based
on
the
same
residential
land
use
scenario
and
essentially
the
same
exposure
assumptions
used
in
deriving
the
rcra
action
levels
.
it
also
represents
the
same
general
`
conservativeness
'
as
an
action
level
,
in
that
it
equates
to
a
10
-
5
excess
lifetime
cancer
risk
.
in
addition
,
the
tsca
level
was
developed
based
on
substantial
studies
conducted
by
the
agency
that
focused
specifically
on
the
risks
posed
by
pcbs
,
as
well
as
other
relevant
factors
relating
to
cleanup
of
pcbs
.
finally
,
1
ppm
is
close
to
the
analytical
detection
limit
for
soil
,
whereas
the
action
level
of
0
09
ppm
identified
in
the
subpart
s
proposal
may
often
be
below
detection
limits
.
the
agency
recognizes
that
adopting
the
tsca
1
ppm
level
as
an
action
level
under
rcra
would
depart
somewhat
from
how
other
soil
action
levels
are
set
.
it
would
be
a
level
established
under
another
regulatory
program
and
,
as
such
,
may
reflect
certain
factors
that
were
not
otherwise
considered
in
developing
the
action
level
concept
under
rcra
.
on
the
other
hand
,
adopting
the
tsca
level
for
soils
would
be
very
much
analogous
to
using
mcls
as
action
levels
for
ground
water
as
discussed
in
the
07/27/1990
proposal
(
see
55
fr
30819
and
30853
.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
adopting
the
1
ppm
action
level
for
pcbs
requires
certain
explicit
revisions
to
the
proposed
subpart
s
regulations
.
specifically
,
as
discussed
above
,
the
proposed
criteria
for
soil
action
levels
that
were
specified
in
proposed
264
521
)
would
need
to
be
revised
to
explicitly
identify
the
1
ppm
level
for
pcbs
.
in
addition
,
appendix
a
to
part
264
subpart
s
would
require
an
amendment
to
identify
the
new
pcb
action
level
.
the
agency
solicits
comment
on
todays
proposal
for
adopting
1
ppm
as
the
action
level
for
pcbs
in
soil
for
the
purpose
of
implementing
corrective
actions
at
rcra
regulated
facilities
.
although
the
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
identifies
other
numbers
that
are
generally
appropriate
for
certain
land
use
settings
,
the
agency
believes
that
these
levels
are
inappropriate
for
use
as
action
levels
,
because
they
may
often
require
substantial
sitespecific
site
specific
information
and
determinations
by
the
agency
about
current
and
future
land
use
and
exposure
potential
.
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
action
level
concept
,
which
requires
identifying
conservative
,
presumptive
levels
that
can
be
established
without
this
type
of
sitespecific
site
specific
information
.
however
,
the
agency
believes
that
many
of
the
provisions
of
the
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
may
be
appropriate
in
making
decisions
regarding
cleanup
levels
in
the
context
of
rcra
corrective
action
.
in
the
preamble
to
the
proposed
subpart
s
regulations
,
epa
stated
that
the
cleanup
levels
and
practices
in
the
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
would
generally
be
appropriate
for
use
in
addressing
pcb
releases
under
rcra
corrective
actions
.
the
agency
wishes
to
reaffirm
its
intention
to
use
the
1987
spill
policy
as
guidance
for
cleanup
of
pcbs
in
the
corrective
action
program
in
essentially
the
same
manner
as
has
been
identified
in
the
superfund
guidance
discussed
above
.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
superfund
guidance
on
pcbs
focused
primarily
on
the
use
of
the
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
in
establishing
preliminary
remediation
goals
,
or
prgs
.
the
subpart
s
proposal
did
not
provide
an
explicit
regulatory
framework
for
setting
prgs
during
the
corrective
action
process
;
however
,
the
preamble
to
the
proposal
did
acknowledge
that
establishing
such
preliminary
cleanup
goals
may
often
be
appropriate
in
a
rcra
context
.
the
agency
may
address
this
issue
more
thoroughly
in
subsequent
rcra
rulemakings
.
in
any
case
,
epa
intends
to
use
the
general
approach
outlined
in
the
superfund
pcb
guidance
in
establishing
preliminary
cleanup
goals
(
when
appropriate
,
as
well
as
`
final
'
cleanup
levels
for
pcb
contamination
at
rcra
facilities
.
as
explained
in
the
cercla
guidance
,
the
levels
specified
in
the
tsca
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
would
generally
be
examined
in
light
of
sitespecific
site
specific
information
,
and
that
the
agency
would
preserve
the
flexibility
inherent
in
the
subpart
s
provisions
for
establishing
cleanup
standards
,
to
select
a
cleanup
level
for
pcbs
that
may
depart
from

todays
proposed
remediation
strategy
for
pcb
spills
under
tsca
.
epa
is
today
proposing
a
new
strategy
under
tsca
for
cleanup
of
all
pcbs
in
the
environment
that
is
closely
modeled
after
the
1987
tsca
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
for
new
pcb
spills
from
electrical
equipment
.
the
agency
believes
that
adopting
such
a
strategy
is
warranted
,
for
several
reasons
.
epas
experience
with
pcb
cleanups
under
cercla
has
shown
that
the
general
approach
and
the
specific
cleanup
goals
expressed
in
the
1987
policy
are
generally
appropriate
for
cleanup
of
pcbs
not
directly
addressed
under
the
policy
,
as
long
as
flexibility
is
provided
for
factoring
sitespecific
site
specific
conditions
into
final
cleanup
decisions
.
in
addition
,
cleanup
of
pcbs
not
directly
addressed
currently
under
the
policy
must
be
addressed
under
tsca
on
a
casebycase
case
by
case
basis
,
with
oversight
of
the
cleanup
action
by
epa
regions
.
this
can
require
considerable
paperwork
and
lengthy
negotiations
between
regulators
and
responsible
parties
over
cleanup
goals
and
procedures
at
individual
sites
.
adopting
a
simpler
,
more
uniform
yet
flexible
strategy
for
cleanup
of
pcbs
in
the
environment
under
tsca
would
thus
serve
to
reduce
administrative
and
other
transactional
costs
and
accelerate
the
cleanup
process
.
epa
is
not
convinced
that
there
is
any
compelling
technical
or
environmental
rationale
for
having
several
separate
and
inconsistent
methods
for
cleaning
up
pcb
spills
,
based
simply
on
when
the
spill
occurred
.
under
tsca
,
the
new
strategy
and
administrative
procedures
propose
to
address
the
problem
of

through
a
flexible
,
tiered
approach

epa
is
proposing
that
pcbs
disposed
of

placed
in
a
land
disposal
facility
,
spilled
,
or
otherwise
released
into
the
environment
prior
to

would
be
presumed
to
be
disposed

in
a
manner
which
does
not
present
a
risk
of
exposure
(
ie
,
the
pcbs
are
presumed
to
be
safely
disposed

epa
makes
a
finding
that
there

proposed

text
in
the
codified

epa
could
then
require
that
an
application
be
submitted
for
approval
of
remediation
and
proper
disposal
of
those
pcb
remediation
wastes
under
the
proposed
761
61
.
all
other
pcb
remediation
wastes
would
be
addressed
by
one
of
several
alternatives
proposed
today
.
in
certain
scenarios
pcbs
could
be
remediated
to
specified
levels
and
treated
under
the
selfimplementing
self
implementing
provisions
proposed
at
761
61
.
this
activity
would
be
conducted
with
a
minimum
of
interaction
between
epa
and
the
party
conducting
the
remediation
,
but
it
would
require
that
the
specified
conditions
be
followed
without
variance
.
any
pcb
remediation
waste
could
be
cleaned
up
under
the
riskbased
risk

provisions
proposed
at
761

this
new

would
be
harmonized
with
the
rcra
and
cercla
programs
.
any
changes
of
the

under

would
be
reflected
in
a
change
under

would
provide
flexibility
based
on

it
would
also
be
the
most
resource
intensive
and
time

to
implement
.
all
actions

the
relevant
requirement
under

providing
the
flexibility
necessary
to

epa
is
also
proposing
to
retain
the
traditional

for
incineration
,
alternate
treatment

,
and

this
section
could
be
used
where
all

would
be
removed
from

or
where

levels
were
established
elsewhere
in
these
rules

section
761
61
)
could
also
be
used
where
a
mechanism
such
as
a
state
established
cleanup
was
recognized
by
epa
through
a
coordinated
approval
under
proposed
761
77
,
where
a
state
had
already
established
a
site
characterization
and
or
remediation
plan
requiring
offsite
off
site
disposal
in
a
facility
with
a
tsca
disposal
approval
for
pcbs
.
the
current
tsca
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
would
still
be
available
to
address
recent
spills
from
electrical
equipment
.
the
party
responsible
for
a
spill
which
was
eligible
for
cleanup
under
the
spill
policy
would
also
have
the
option
of
using
one
of
the
alternatives
available
under
proposed
761

or
761
79
(
decontamination
,
where
applicable
.
it
should
be
noted
that
,
in
accordance
with
the
antidilution
dilution
provisions
of
7611b
,
if
the
contamination
was
from
an
authorized
use
,
then
the
pcb
remediation
waste
is
regulated
based
on
the
regulatory
status
of
the
pcbs
at
the
time
of
their
release
into
the
environment
.
the
following
illustrates
this
point
.
a
transformer
contains
pcb
dielectric
fluid
at
1000
ppm
.
the
unit
leaks
its
dielectric
fluid
,
and
all
resulting
pcb
remediation
waste
is
regulated
,
regardless
of
concentration
,
because
the
original
dielectric
fluid
was
regulated
at
the
time
of
the
leak
.
however
,
if
the
same
pcb
transformer
is
first
reclassified
to
nonpcb
pcb
status
(
ie
,
less
than
50
ppm
pcb
in
the
dielectric
fluid
)
and
nonpcb
pcb
dielectric
fluid
leaks
,
none
of
the
resulting
remediation
waste
is
regulated
under
tsca
(
but
not
necessarily
other
laws
or
regulations
)
because
the
dielectric
fluid
was
unregulated
at
the
time
of
the
leak
.
there
are
two
questions
associated
with
any
cleanup
.
the
first
question
is
to
what
level
must
contamination
be
cleaned
and
the
second
question
is
what
are
the
disposal
requirements
for
the
contaminated
material
.
in
general
,
the
current
pcb
rules
address
the
disposal
question
by
stating
that
pcbs
diluted
through
acts
such
as
spilling
or
processing
for
disposal
must
be
disposed
of
based
on
the
disposal
requirements
for
that
pcb
concentration
at
the
time
the
pcbs
came
out
of
service
or
were
spilled
.
however
,
except
for
those
scenarios
addressed
by
the
tsca
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
,
the
current
rules
require
complete
removal
of
spilled
or
otherwise
improperly
disposed
of
pcbs
.
most
commenters
to
the
anprm
were
very
supportive
of
the
agencys
desire
to
amend
the
current
rules
to
allow
the
management
of
remediation
wastes
based
on
their
current
pcb
concentrations
and
the
sitespecific
site
specific
risk
from
exposure
.
several
commenters
asked
that
epa
address
the
question
of
cleanup
levels
by
establishing
,
in
this
rule
,
national
standards
for
specific
exposure
scenarios
,
with
provisions
for
variances
that
would
be
binding
,
for
remediation
of
wastes
containing
pcbs
for
all
federal
programs
that
would
be
preemptive
of
state
and
local
requirements
.
these
commenters
suggested
that
this
approach
could
reduce
the
`
transactional
'
costs
associated
with
sitebysite
site
by
site
negotiations
,
promote
voluntary
remediation
activities
and
,
in
general
,
speed
the
cleanup
of
sites
.
epa
has
limited
authority
under
tsca
to
preempt
state
or
local
requirements
for
the
cleanup
or
disposal
of
pcb
remediation
wastes
.
with
regard
to
establishing
uniform
standards
for
specific
exposure
scenarios
for
the
remediation
of
pcbs
and
other
hazardous
substances
or
constituents
,
epa
has
contemplated
the
following
options
:
(
a
)
setting
specific
standards
,
(
b
)
using
a
uniform
decisionmaking
decision
making
process
with
target
standards
,
but
allowing
sitespecific
site
specific
variances
,
or
(
c
)
using
a
uniform
decisionmaking
decision
making
process
with
a
general
goal
and
sitespecific
site
specific
application
.
epa
believes
that
specific
standards
are
most
appropriate
when
dealing
with
common
disposal
scenarios
and
limited
disposal
options
.
favoring
sitespecific
site
specific
approaches
to
remediate
old
spills
is
most
appropriate
when
there
is
little
commonality
at
the
various
sites
among
the
problems
being
addressed
and
the
available
disposal
options
.
except
for
the
limited
scenarios
proposed
in
761
61
,
epa
does
not
believe
that
it
has
sufficient
experience
or
information
to
establish
additional
selfimplementing
self
implementing
cleanup
and
disposal
options
.
epa
is
seeking
comments
,
supported
by
technical
information
from
those
engaged
in
remedial
actions
;
other
federal
,
state
or
local
entities
responsible
for
the
implementation
or
oversight
of
remedial
actions
;
and
the
general
public
on
all
three
approaches
including
the
following
proposal
.
several
remedial
approaches
could
be
proposed
for
any
given
site
which
is
contaminated
with
pcbs
.
in
this
section
,
epa
is
proposing
three
alternatives
for
the
cleanup
and
disposal
of
pcb
remediation
waste
under
tsca
.
the
first
alternative
would
be
selfimplementing
self
implementing
.
the
term
selfimplementing
self
implementing
means
that
epa
approval
under
tsca
would
not
be
necessary
as
long
as
the
entire
remediation
conformed
to
the
procedures
and
standards
of
the
first
alternative
at
proposed
761
61
.
the
second
alternative
,
performancebased
performance
based
disposal
,
is
the
use
of
`
traditional
'
disposal
technologies
of
incineration
and
chemical
waste
landfilling
,
according
to
the
approval
process
and
standards
as
proposed
at
761
61
.
the
third
alternative
,
riskbased
risk
based
disposal
,
is
a
process
and
decision
document
not
unlike
the
superfund
remedial
action
decisionmaking
decision
making
process
and
record
of
decision
(
rod
.
each
step
would
be
approved
by
the
regional
administrator
having
jurisdiction
over
the
site
which
is
contaminated
with
pcbs
,
including
a
risk
assessment
and
any
onsite
treatment
,
or
redisposition
of
treated
or
untreated
remediation
waste
at
the
site
.
treatment
levels
would
be
based
on
a
sitespecific
site
specific
risk
assessment
described
at
proposed
761
61
.
those
seeking
a
pcb
disposal
approval
could
also
avail
themselves
of
the
`
coordinated
approval
'
provision
(
see
unit
iiik1
.
of
this
preamble
.
this
alternative
would
allow
the
recognition
of
a
cleanup
action
conducted
under
another
authority
such
as
a
rcra
corrective
action
permit
or
in
compliance
with
a
cercla
rod
or
enforcement
decision
document
.
i
.
selfimplementing
self
implementing
option
.
the
selfimplementing
self
implementing
alternative
is
patterned
after
the
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
(
40
cfr
part
761
,
subpart
g
,
which
sets
standards
for
cleaning
up
spills
shortly
after
they
occur
.
like
the
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
,
this
proposed
alternative
requires
that
riskbased
risk
based
surface
and
soil
levels
be
achieved
.
however
,
an
important
distinction
between
subpart
g
and
the
proposed
selfimplementing
self
implementing
alternative
is
that
for
nonrecent
recent
spills
,
there
may
be
limited
information
concerning
the
concentration
and
amount
of
pcbs
released
to
the
environment
and
the
time
,
nature
,
and
extent
of
that
release
and
any
subsequent
migration
.
subpart
g
established
spill
cleanup
requirements
addressing
the
concentration
and
amount
of
spilled
materials
based
on
the
location
of
the
spill
and
potential
exposure
to
the
spilled
pcbs
.
spill
cleanup
in
this
proposal
is
based
on
the
current
concentration
in
the
material
onto
which
a
spill
occurred
.
the
extent
of
migration
of
the
spill
is
likely
to
be
greater
for
an
old
spill
than
for
a
more
recent
or
new
spill
.
this
difference
plus
the
requirement
for
rapid
initiation
and
containment
of
the
spill
were
partly
responsible
for
the
provision
at
40
cfr
761
135
which
creates
a
presumption
against
an
enforcement
action
for
penalties
for
the
act
of
illegal
disposal
.
while
the
selfimplementing
self
implementing
proposal
allows
disposal
of
remediation
waste
according
to
the
wastes
current
existing
concentration
,
the
proposal
does
not
create
a
presumption
against
enforcement
action
for
penalties
for
the
act
of
unauthorized
disposal
.
another
significant
difference
from
subpart
g
is
that
the
selfimplementing
self
implementing
disposal
requirements
would
not
apply
to
certain
environmental
and
exposure
scenarios
having
the
potential
for
a
high
risk
of
exposure
.
subpart
g
allows
certain
residual
levels
to
remain
after
cleanup
based
on
the
potential
future
use
of
the
site
,
including
the
imposition
of
physical
or
institutional
restrictions
limiting
access
,
which
could
have
been
incorrectly
assumed
to
always
directly
correlate
with
exposure
in
those
areas
.
todays
proposal
addresses
residual
levels
based
not
only
on
access
to
areas
,
but
also
potential
exposure
to
residual
pcb
levels
within
those
areas
.
for
example
,
a
restricted
access
commercial
area
might
limit
who
could
be
exposed
,
but
might
not
limit
how
much
a
person
with
access
could
be
exposed
.
in
this
proposal
,
concrete
is
not
considered
a
nonporous
porous
surface
as
it
is
in
subpart
g
(
see
the
proposed
definition
of
`
nonporous
non
porous
surface
'
at
7613
.
consequently
,
concrete
containing
pcbs
would
have
to
be
removed
rather
than
just
wiped
off
.
the
size
of
the
remediation
area
is
not
an
issue
with
todays
selfimplementing
self
implementing
proposal
as
it
is
with
subpart
g
.
the
selfimplementing
self
implementing
option
differentiates
between
the
cleanup
of
a
site
and
the
disposal
of
pcb
remediation
waste
from
the
site
.
cleanup
means
the
identification
and
reduction
of
the
pcb
concentrations
,
and
or
removal
of
pcb
remediation
waste
to
a
specified
residual
pcb
concentration
at
its
existing
location
.
the
cleanup
portion
of
this
alternative
allows
remediation
waste
with
specified
pcb
levels
to
remain
undisturbed
at
the
site
and
not
be
disposed
of
.
cleanup
may
be
followed
by
either
(
or
both
)
offsite
off
site
disposal
of
a
certain
amount
of
pcb
remediation
waste
,
or
treatment
of
a
certain
amount
of
remediation
waste
at
the
site
.
disposal
means
the
movement
of
pcb
remediation
wastes
from
the
site
of
contamination
to
another
location
for
destruction
or
containment
(
offsite
off
site
disposal
)
or
the
destruction
or
containment
of
pcb
remediation
waste
at
the
cleanup
site
(
onsite
on
site
disposal
.
section
761
61
would
apply
to
the
cleanup
and
disposal
of
all
pcb
remediation
wastes
regardless
of
when
the
disposal
,
spill
,
or
contamination
occurred
.
subpart
g
would
continue
to
apply
to
recent
spills
from
electrical
equipment
;
however
,
the
party
responsible
for
the
spill
and
cleanup
could
choose
to
follow
761
61
.
there
are
other
conforming
changes
which
could
be
made
to
40
cfr
part
761
,
subpart
g
,
resulting
from
this
proposal
.
these
changes
have
not
been
made
because
those
who
were
a
party
to
the
negotiation
of
subpart
g
have
not
been
a
direct
party
to
the
development
of
this
proposal
.
nevertheless
,
the
conforming
changes
to
subpart
g
have
been
accounted
for
in
this
proposal
and
the
proposal
is
consistent
with
the
conforming
changes
,
especially
with
respect
to
references
of
`
old
'
spills
.
section
761
61
specifically
applies
to
`
old
'
spills
.
the
selfimplementing
self
implementing
remediation
option
proposes
onsite
on
site
disposal
to
specified
cleanup
levels
of
residual
pcbs
in
the
pcb
remediation
waste
.
cleanup
levels
would
be
more
stringent
for
high
exposure
areas
than
for
low
exposure
areas
,
as
these
terms
would
be
defined
in
7613
.
three
selfimplementing
self
implementing
onsite
on
site
options
are
proposed
:
capping
higher
residual
levels
(
a
definition
of
`
cap
'
is
proposed
at
7613
,
`
treating
down
'
from
higher
levels
to
lower
levels
onsite
on
site
using
a
nonchlorinated
chlorinated
solvent
washing
process
;
and
microencapsulation
or
vitrification
(
definitions
of
these
terms
are
proposed
at
7613
.
these
last
two
immobilization
technologies
are
being
proposed
because
they
have
been
promulgated
under
rcra
for
debris
which
is
contaminated
with
both
rcra
hazardous
waste
and
tsca
pcb
waste
(

.
based
on
epas
experience
with
approving
pcb
disposal
technologies
,
the
solvent
washing
process
is
the
only
currently
available
destruction
or
physical
separation
pcb
disposal
process
considered
generally
effective
in
a
variety
of
situations
,
commercially
feasible
at
ambient
temperatures
(
ie
,
no
external
heat
source
,
and
safe
enough
to
be
conducted
without
prior
approval
.
epa
will
consider
these
factors
,
along
with
the
general
statutory
requirement
to
prevent
unreasonable
risk
of
injury
to
health
and
the
environment
,
in
considering
the
addition
,
under
761
61
,
of
other
processes
,
procedures
,
or
technologies
to
761
61
.
epa
specifically
requests
comments
on
the
best
method
to
expeditiously
include
new
universally
acceptable
riskbased
risk
based
treatment
technologies
as
selfimplementing
self
implementing
treatment
options
prior
to
amendment
of
761
61
)
in
the
federal
register
.
.
the
kind
of
solvent
washing
process
epa
proposes
for
treating
pcbs
removes
pcbs
from
the
waste
,
separates
the
pcbs
from
the
solvent
,
and
reuses
the
solvent
while
disposing
of
the
pcbs
.
residual
levels
of
solvent
in
the
treated
pcb
remediation
waste
must
correspond
to
allowable
levels
under
all
other
federal
and
local
regulations
,
including
requirements
under
rcra
and
regulations
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
administration
(
osha
.
for
other
techniques
such
as
vitrification
,
epa
is
concerned
about
additional
issues
such
as
the
release
of
volatile
products
of
incomplete
combustion
(
pics
)
especially
when
the
process
is
conducted

.
if
epa
cannot
devise
a
procedure
or
prescribe
a
technology
for
addressing
the
issue
of

,
vitrification
will
be
deleted
from

epa
is
drawing
a
parallel
to
the
rcra
rules
for

of
certain

of
effectiveness
of
microencapsulation
or
vitrification
of
pcb
containing

using
the

epa
is
proposing
50

(

approximately

[

)
as
the
treatability
level

if
adopted
under

any

that
has
been
microencapsulated

vitrified
and
subsequently
shown
to
leach
pcbs
at
less

,
as
measured

would
be
considered

after

or
disposal
could

the

would
still
be
subject
to
all
prohibitions
in

one
commenter
to
the
anprm
proposed
that
epa
use
the
american

institute
american
nuclear
society
leachability
test
(
ansi
ans
161
)
to
determine
the
effectiveness
of
microencapsulation
or
vitrification
technologies
.
the
major
technical
differences
between
the
two
leaching
procedures
are
the
amount
of
surface
area
exposed
to
the
leaching
medium
and
the
neutral
(
versus
the
tclps
mildly
acidic
)
nature
of
the
leaching
medium
in
the
ansi
ans
standard
.
as
stated
in
its
introduction
,
the
ansi
ans
standard
serves
only
as
a
basis
for
indexing
releases
from
the
encapsulant
and
does
not
apply
to
any
specific
environmental
situation
.
the
commenter
noted
that
a
variety
of
contaminant
release
tests
and
test
conditions
should
be
developed
to
assess
the
potential
for
release
of
specific
contaminants
in
given
situations
.
since
this
proposal
is
focused
on
the
release
of
a
toxic
constituent
from
a
matrix
when
codisposed
disposed
with
other
solid
waste
in
a
municipal
solid
waste
landfill
,
epa
believes
that
the
question
of
which
test
to
use
is
more
properly
addressed
in
the
solid
and
hazardous
waste
regulations
under
rcra
than
the
pcb
rules
under
tsca
.
todays
proposed
selfimplementing
self
implementing
option
for
disposal
of
pcb
remediation
waste
includes
a
different
way
to
evaluate
pcb
concentrations
during
site
remediation
.
some
field
screening
tests
have
been
developed
and
approved
for
use
under
epas
`
test
methods
for
evaluating
solid
waste
'
(
sw846
)
and
have
otherwise
been
widely
used
.
chemicals
other
than
pcbs
at
the
remediation
site
may
interfere
with
the
tests
and
indicate
that
pcbs
are
not
present
when
in
fact
pcbs
are
present
(
a
false
negative
.
the
correct
application
of
the
tests
may
still
not
inform
or
warn
the
user
of
the
presence
of
such
interferences
.
this
proposal
includes
the
use
of
several
kinds
of
pcb
field
screening
tests
during
remediation
,
so
long
as
confirmatory
sampling
is
used
to
guard
against
false
negatives
and
to
demonstrate
the
absence
of
interferences
which
would
render
the
analytical
results
invalid
.
the
ability
to
obtain
acceptable
analytical
results
in
a
very
short
time
onsite
on
site
and
while
remediation
is
under
way
can
complete
remediation
goals
more
quickly
and
at
lower
costs
.
the
selfimplementing
self
implementing
option
for
the
disposal
of
pcb
remediation
waste
would
offer
one
new
consideration
for
pcb
disposal
at
761
61
:
allowing
nonliquid
liquid
wastes
generated
by
the
cleanup
process
(
eg
,
spent
abrasives
)
to
be
disposed
of
at
their
existing
concentration
(
ie
,
at
a
concentration
less
than
the
maximum
concentration
of
pcbs
found
at
the
remediation
waste
site
.
solvents
used
in
remediation
activities
could
be
reused
according
to
provisions
proposed
in
761
79
)
and
761
61
.
during
use
of
the
solvents
,
secondary
containment
would
have
to
be
provided
to
ensure
no
solvent
releases
to
soil
or
water
.
a
general
requirement
for
protection
for
workers
engaged
in
decontamination
activities
is
also
proposed
.
decontamination
activities
could
not
proceed
until
those
workers
conducting
the
decontamination
are
protected
from
exposure
to
pcbs
and
the
materials
used
to
decontaminate
.

the

on
the

and
the

resulting
from

and

the

would
continue
to
be

of

the

the

essentially
the

as

to

the

,
epas
general
principles
for
reviewing
a
pcb
remediation
approval
application
are
stated
here
in
the
form
of
four
preferences
.
the
first
preference
would
be
to
have
a
permanent
remedy
that
allows
for
the
least
restrictive
access
and
land
use
restrictions
at
each
site
.
the
second
preference
would
be
to
impose
greater
protection
of
sensitive
ecosystems
such
as
water
resources
,
croplands
,
grazing
lands
,
and
residential
areas
than
the
target
standards
,
expressed
as
cleanup
levels
in
the
selfimplementing
self
implementing
option
(
at
proposed
761
61
,
would
provide
.
the
third
preference
would
be
for
destruction
or
extraction
instead
of
land
disposal
.
the
fourth
preference
would
be
for
using
onsite
on
site
or
existing
offsite
off
site
disposal
facilities
versus
developing
new
offsite
off
site
land
disposal
facilities
.
microencapsulation
or
vitrification
would
not
be
a
preferred
technology
for
pcbs
if
it
caused
unacceptable
increases
in
the
overall
volume
of
wastes
being
sent
offsite
off
site
to
chemical
waste
landfills
,
resulted
in
a
liquid
phase
,
or
allowed
unacceptable
levels
of
leaching
of
pcbs
.
the
evaluation
criteria
for
sitespecific
site
specific
variances
from
the
target
standards
would
include
:
(
1
)
risk
factors
associated
with
the
waste
(
eg
,
volume
,
concentration
,
physical
state
,
toxicity
,
mobility
,
and
(
2
)
risk
factors
associated
with
the
proposed
waste
management
option
(
eg
,
safety
,
reliability
,
effectiveness
,
possibility
of
discharge
to
surface
or
ground
water
,
current
and
reasonably
expected

,
technical

,
resource
value
,
proposed
institutional
controls
,
permanence
of
remedy
,
potential
for
concentration
of
pcbs
and
waste
minimization
.
while
this
paragraph
reflects
some
factors
associated
with
each
criterion
,
these
unranked
factors
would
only
provide
notice
and
assistance
in
defining
the
criterion
.
epa
would
not
be
limiting
itself
to
the
factors
listed
or
require
that
each
factor
listed
be
considered
.
e
.
implementation
of
pcb
remediation
programs
.
currently
,
based
on
the
results
of
site
sampling
,
historical
,
or
other
data
,
epa
may
presume
that
pcbs
are
illegally
disposed
of
at
a
site
and
require
remediation
under
tsca
.
in
that
case
,
the
burden
is
on
the
site
owner
or
operator
to
establish
,
through
persuasive
evidence
,
that
the
pcbs
are
not
illegally
disposed
of
under
tsca
.
today
,
epa
proposes
to
address
all
pcb
remediation
waste
,
regardless
of
concentration
,
physical
state
or
date
of
disposal
(
see
proposed
introductory
text
at
761
60
)
under
761
61
,
based
on
the
risk
of
exposure
or
injury
they
now
pose
.
epa
would
apply
the
current
`
antidilution
anti
dilution
'
provision
at
7611b
)
to
retain
regulatory
authority
over
pcb
remediation
waste
even
where
the
pcb
concentration
is
now
below
50
ppm
,
unless
the
dilution
was
authorized
(
eg
,
as
the
result
of
a
transformer
reclassification
under
761
30
)
and
the
authorized
dilution
occurred
prior
to
disposal
.
antidilution
anti
dilution
would
not
mandate
disposal
requirements
for
pcb
remediation
waste
under
proposed
761
61
(
or
761
62
for
pcb
nonremediation
remediation
waste
.
again
,
the
burden
would
be
on
the
site
owner
or
operator
to
establish
,
through
persuasive
evidence
,
that
the
pcb
remediation
wastes
,
regardless
of
current
concentration
or
date
of
disposal
are
legally
disposed
of
under
tsca
and
in
the
case
of
wastes
disposed
of
before
04/18/1978
,
which
are
now
50
ppm
pcbs
,
do
not
pose
a
risk
of
injury
.
pcbs
at
any
concentration
are
subject
to
remediation
under
cercla
or
corrective
action
under
rcra
.
this
is
not
an
inconsistency
in
application
of
the
various
statutes
because
the
50
ppm
pcb
level
under
tsca
is
based
in
part
on
the
economic
impacts
of
the
pcb
regulations
and
not
solely
on
risk
.
epa
is
not
precluded
from
taking
action
under
any
other
statute
it
administers
simply
because
it
has
chosen
not
to
regulate
use
or
disposal
or
take
remedial
action
under
tsca
.
for
example
,
a
party
begins
a
cleanup
of
a
historic
pre1978
pre
spill
.
this
site
would
not
fall
under
40
cfr
part
761
,
subpart
g
and
would
require
regional
approval
for
cleanup
levels
for
pcbs
at
50
ppm
.
the
soil
at
the
site
is
found
to
vary
in
concentration
between
10
ppm
and
100
ppm
pcbs
.
upon
application
to
the
regional
administrator
,
under
proposed
761
61
,
the
site
could
be
cleaned
to
a
specified
level
,
and
the
resulting
pcb
remediation
waste
treated
by
chemical
dechlorination
.
or
,
under
the
proposal
,
the
regional
administrator
could
,
upon
application
and
upon
a
sitespecific
site
specific
evaluation
,
determine
that
an
immobilizing
procedure
such
as
in
situ
vitrification
was
a
viable
alternative
.
a
disposal
application
would
then
be
judged
by
epa
on
its
overall
ability
to
protect
health
and
the
environment
from
unreasonable
risk
of
injury
from
pcbs
.
pcbs
at
levels
&
lt
;
50
ppm
(
at
a
pre1978
pre
disposal
)
would
still
be
subject
to
cleanup
under
rcra
and
cercla
authorities
.
the
disposal
rule
proposed
today
would
be
a
potentially
`
applicable
or
relevant
and
appropriate
requirement
'
for
pcb
cleanups
under
the
cercla
,
both
with
respect
to
the
disposal
of
pcb
remediation
wastes
at
cercla
sites
,
and
with
respect
to
the
remediation
approach
utilized
and
the
residual
level
of
pcbs
in
soil
.
however
,
epa
does
not
anticipate
that
the
provisions
relating
to
the
remedial
approach
and
residual
levels
permitted
will
significantly
affect
cercla
cleanups
,
because
the
rule
would
provide
three
options
.
generally
,
epa
would
be
likely
to
select
the
riskbased
risk
based
option
at
761
61
,
which
would
give
the
agency
very
broad
discretion
in
selecting
a
remedy
.
one
commenter
suggested
that
epa
should
conduct
a
comparative
risk
analysis
of
all
possible
disposal
techniques
and
include
other
factors
such
as
transportation
and
disposal
of
treatment
residues
before
issuing
a
pcb
disposal
approval
under
tsca
.
epa
does
not
believe
that
tsca
authority
should
be
used
to
accomplish
exactly
what
cercla
,
an
all
encompassing
proactive
remediation
statute
,
was
designed
to
do
.
rather
,
the
pcb
disposal
approval
process
under
tsca
is
simply
one
of
determining
the
effectiveness
of
an
applicants
proposed
cleanup
and
disposal
options
for
pcbs
in
achieving
a
specific
standard
.

decontamination
standards
and
procedures

epa
is
proposing
several
changes
and
additions
to
761
79
with
general
applicability
throughout
the
pcb
program
under
tsca
,
for
liquids
and
nonporous
porous
surfaces
,
except
where
another
standard
is
established
,
for
example
in
a
rcra
permit
,
a
tsca
pcb
disposal
approval
,
a
superfund
rod
,
or
a
superfund
enforcement
decision
document
.
todays
proposal
includes
a
general
decontamination
standard
of
10
micrograms
pcbs
(
(
g/100
square
centimeters
(
cm
)
)
(
as
measured
by
standard
wipe
tests
,
761
123
)
for
a
nonporous
porous
surface
(
see
proposed
definition
at
7613
)
and
two
decontamination
procedures
for
nonporous
porous
surfaces
.
the
decontamination
standard
may
be
achieved
using
any
disposal
or
cleaning
technique
which
,
in
some
instances
,
may
require
prior
approval
by
epa
.
although
activities
such
as
filtering
,
soaking
,
wiping
,
stripping
of
insulation
,
chopping
,
scraping
,
or
the
use
of
abrasives
to
remove
or
separate
pcbs
from
contaminated
surfaces
or
liquids
may
be
processing
for
disposal
as
opposed
to
disposal
,
epa
is
proposing
to
waive
any
requirement
to
obtain
prior
approval
under
tsca
for
these
listed
activities
.
epa
also
considered
whether
to
include
distillation
in
this
exemption
but
remains
concerned
about
releases
of
volatile
and
semivolatile
semi
volatile
organic
compounds
to
the
environment
.
epa
is
seeking
comment
on
the
inclusion
of
distillation
.
all
residues
containing
pcbs
from
these
and
other
`
disposal
'
activities
would
remain
regulated
.
the
proposed
standard
for
decontamination
of
solid
surfaces
is
the
standard
in
the
pcb
spill
cleanup
policy
at
761
125
.
epa
believes
that
10
g
pcb/100
cm
is
protective
for
disposal
or
subsequent
reuse
of
the
decontaminated
surface
.
this
standard
has
also
been
demonstrated
to
epa
through
the
pcb
disposal
approval
process
to
be
achievable
through
a
wide
variety
of
techniques
.
the
residual
cleaning
materials
containing
pcbs
would
be
managed
and
disposed
of
as
a
pcb
waste
in
accordance
with
the
applicable
pcb
disposal
regulations
in

d
.
the
`
note
'
currently
following
761
79
would
be
inserted
as
introductory
text
under
761
79
to
warn
those
conducting
decontamination
operations
that
compliance
with
this
section
would
not
relieve
them
of
their
duty
to
comply
with
other
federal
,
state
,
or
local
requirements
for
the
use
and
disposal
of
solvents
.
one
example
is
the
requirement
to
comply
with
the
rules
for
the
disposal
of
wastes
identified
or
listed
under
rcra
or
state
or
local
laws
as
solid
,
hazardous
,
or
otherwise
regulated
wastes
.
as
an
alternative
to
decontamination
followed
by
sampling
,
for
nonporous
porous
surfaces
,
especially
those
that
cannot
be
accessed
for
sampling
,
epa
is
proposing
two
nonaggressive
aggressive
procedures
for
decontamination
.
the
first
procedure
is
for
surfaces
contaminated
with
mineral
oil
dielectric
fluid
(
modef
)
with
pcb
concentrations
10000
ppm
(
see
proposed
761
79
.
the
second
procedure
is
for
surfaces
contaminated
with
higher
concentrations
of
pcbs
in
modef
and
askarel
pcbs
(
see
proposed
761
79
.
each
procedure
involves
a
15hour
hour
nonaggressive
aggressive
soaking
(
ie
,
no
agitation
of
the
kerosene
or
movement
of
the
contaminated
surface
in
the
kerosene
.
proposed
761
79
)
would
require
a
second
soak
with
clean
kerosene
.
after
decontamination
using
one
of
these
procedures
,
the
decontaminated
surface
would
not
be
regulated
for
disposal
and
could
be
reused
except
in
association
with
food
,
feed
,
or
drinking
water
in
accordance
with
proposed
761
20
.
epas
research
demonstrates
that
these
two
nonaggressive
aggressive
procedures
using
kerosene
should
decontaminate
surfaces
to
a
level
10
g/100
cm
.
.
therefore
,
confirmatory
sampling
would
not
be
required
.
epa
is
requesting
comment
,
supported
by
laboratory
data
,
on
aggressive
versus
the
proposed
nonaggressive
aggressive
decontamination
techniques
especially
where
the
volume
of
kerosene
or
another
solvent
proposed
by
the
commenter
can
be
reduced
.
epa
recognizes
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
proposed
decontamination
procedure
may
not
result
in
final
surface
levels
at
or
below
10
g/100cm
.
.
for
purposes
of
implementation
,
if
epa
subsequently
sampled
a
decontaminated
surface
and
found
levels
above
10
g/100
cm
,
,
the
surface
would
be
regulated
unless
it
could
be
shown
by
the
owner
(
ie
,
through
laboratory
documentation
)
that
the
original
pcb
concentrations
were
determined
,
the
prescribed
procedures
in
761
79
)
or
(
f
)
were
followed
for
those
concentrations
of
pcbs
,
and
the
prescribed
volume
of
pcb
rinseate
was
used
and
properly
disposed
of
(
ie
,
through
copies
of
the
manifests
and
certificates
of
disposal
.
epa
is
also
proposing
additional
language
at
761
79
)
to
clarify
that
the
disposal
of
solvents
,
abrasives
,
or
equipment
used
in
decontamination
procedures
is
regulated
and
is
proposing
another
disposal
option
,
specifically
disposal
in
an
industrial
boiler
,
for
certain
of
those
solvents
.
the
proposal
would
also
require
at
761
79
)
that
all
decontamination
activities
be
conducted
with
containment
adequate
to
prevent
releases
of
pcbs
to
the
environment
.
epa
is
proposing
that
any
decontamination
activities
conducted
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
761
79
would
not
require
a
pcb
disposal
approval
from
epa
.
workers
would
have
to
be
protected
against
exposure
through
dermal
contact
or
inhalation
;
however
,
epa
is
not
specifying
what
measures
must
be
taken
.
the
proposal
establishes
a
decontamination
standard
for
water
of
05
micrograms
pcb
per
liter
(
05
g
l
)
or
approximately
05

pcb
(
see
proposed
761

.
this
standard
is
consistent
with
epa
drinking
water
levels
for
pcbs
at
40
cfr
141
61
.
epa
is
proposing
a
05
ppb
decontamination
standard
because
it
is
difficult
to
ensure
that
the
decontaminated
water
will
not
be
reused
in
association
with
food
or
feed
or
as
drinking
water
for
livestock
or
humans
.
a
conforming
amendment
at
proposed
761
20
)
would
allow
the
unrestricted
reuse
of
water
decontaminated
in
accordance
with
the
level
established
in
761
79
.
the
agency
believes
that
uses
of
water
at
or
below
the
proposed
decontamination
level
would
not
pose
an
unreasonable
risk
of
injury
to
health
or
the
environment
.
the
proposal
also
establishes
a
decontamination
standard
for
organic
liquids
,
not
associated
with
remediation
wastes
,
of
less
than
2
milligrams
pcb
per
liter
(
ie
,
&
lt
;
2
ppm
pcb
)
(
see
proposed
761
79
.
epa
believes
that
placing
these
standards
in
the
decontamination
section
will
clarify
and
simplify
the
implementation
of
the
pcb
program
by
specifically
defining
levels
for
decontamination
and
removing
the
prohibitions
against
reuse
(
see
761
20
)
and
(

.
the
proposed
introductory
text
to
761

states
in
part
that
`
pcb

must
be
disposed
of
in
accordance
with
provisions
of
this
subpart
'
epa
interprets
this
to
mean
that
any

the

may
also
be

this

is
important
because
it
causes
the

,
specifically

as
a
point
of
clarification
,
epa
believes
that

in
its
core
will
probably
not
rapidly
be

to

certain

some

epa
against
proposing
controls
on

stating
that
current
processes
were
adequate

another
group

recommended
that
either
additional
controls
be
placed
on
industrial

or
that
drained
pcbcontaminated
pcb

be
otherwise
regulated

these
commenters
suggested
environmental
harm
could
be
caused
by
the
unregulated
combustion
of
pcbcontaminated

.
epa
believes
that
responsibly
run
industrial

provide
a
valuable
recycling
benefit
and
that
the
current
federal
regulatory
matrix
in

with
the
proposed

would
provide
adequate

not
be

,
a
demonstrated
need
to
store

the

and
a
demonstration
that

the
problem
of
capacity
shortfalls
is
expected
to
continue
for
some

of
the

fifty

current

are
approximately
5

.
the
maximum
disposal
rate
for
the

is
approximately
3
09
million

per

current
projections
indicate
that
it
will
take
30
to
50
years
to
dispose
of
the
current

all
the

therefore
,
doe

not

meet

even
though
it

several

requested

not
be

epa
agrees

that
there

there

disposal
capacity
for

therefore
,
facilities

often
cannot
comply

there
will

it

one

several

suggested
that

amend

to
accommodate
concerns
relating
to
management
and
storage
and
the
uniqueness
of
pcb
radioactive

.
there
are
certain
elements
relating
to
storage
of
radioactive
wastes
containing
plutonium
or
enriched
uranium
that
require
consideration
of
criticality
safety
(
ie
,
the
prevention
of
nuclear
reactions
that
would
pose
a
threat
to
health
and
the
environment

all
actions
relating
to
criticality
or
radiation

issues
must
be
coordinated

the
local
office
of

;
for

,
this
would
be
the
appropriate
nrc
regional
office
or

.
the
issue
of
criticality
relates
to
proper
storage
of
fissionable

so
that
a

the
issue

to
meet

would
not

several
commenters
stated
that
pcb
radioactive

may
also
contain
additional
materials
such
as
asbestos
that
cannot
be
incinerated
.
epa
believes
that
technology
exists
which
allows
pcbs
to
be
separated
from
other
materials
(
eg
,

epa
recommends
that
whenever
possible
pcbs
be
separated
from
other
wastes
;
however
,
todays
proposal
does
not
contain
requirements
for
separating
pcbs
because
guidance
for
separating
pcbs
,
from
water
for
example
,
already
exists
.
epa
had
developed
a
policy
allowing
the
physical
separation
of
pcbs
from

long
as

this

supported
the

some

provided
additional
caveats
on
how
such
an

should
be
structured

comments
in
favor
of
the
household

exemption
essentially
fell
into
four
categories
:
(
1
)
broadly
define
the
scope
of
the

,
(
2
)
consider
the
impact
of
the
exemption
on

)
limit
the
scope
of
the

,
and
(

)
address
other
disposal
considerations
(
ie
,
the
disposal
of
materials
containing
pcbs
used
in
the
construction
of
residential
buildings
.
commenters
not
in
favor
of
the
tsca
proposal
for
an
exemption
questioned
whether
there
should
be
a
household
waste
exemption
under
either
tsca
or
rcra
,
and
whether
the
volume
of
waste
containing
pcbs
which
was
generated
from
households
was
significant
enough
to
warrant
an
exemption
.
epas
responses
to
the
four
broad
categories
of
comments
are
provided
below
.
a
.
broadly
define
exemption
.
.
those
in
favor
of
establishing
a
household
waste
exemption
suggested
broadly
defining
the
activities
that
would
qualify
for
the
exemption
.
one
commenter
suggested
epa
use
the
definition
for
`
municipal
solid
wastes
'
found
at
7613
to
define
the
scope
of
the
household
waste
exemption
.
municipal
solid
wastes
are
defined
as
`
garbage
,
refuse
,
sludges
,
wastes
and
other
discarded
materials
resulting
from
residential
and
nonindustrial
industrial
operations
and
activities
,
such
as
household
activities
,
office
functions
,
and
commercial
housekeeping
wastes
'
however
,
if
such
a
change
was
made
,
the
exemption
would
include
items
epa
believes
should
not
be
excluded
from
regulation
(
eg
,
pcb
wastes
from
offices
and
commercial
activities
.
another
commenter
stated
that
commercial
buildings
should
also
be
included
in
a
household
waste
exemption
because
the
wastes
generated
at
these
buildings
may
be
from
the
same
sources
and
types
of
equipment
found
in
the
household
.
the
effect
of
banning
the
manufacture
,
processing
,
and
distribution
in
commerce
of
pcbs
,
coupled
with
actions
taken
to
limit
the
use
of
pcbs
,
focuses
the
agencys
concern
on
activities
where
the
continued
use
of
pcbs
has
been
authorized
(
ie
,
industrial
or
commercialscale
commercial
scale
settings
such
as
utilities
,
manufacturing
sites
,
construction
renovation
demolition
projects
,
etc
)
rather
than
on
household
settings
where
appliances
with
pcbs
may
not
generally
be
found
(
ref
.
32
.
additionally
,
industrial
and
commercialscale
commercial
scale
pcb
disposal
activities
,
because
of
the
risks
associated
with
the
greater
volume
of
pcb
wastes
generated
by
these
activities
,
require
a
level
of
protection
for
health
and
the
environment
that
can
best
be
achieved
through
demonstrated
and
effective
pcb
destruction
and
containment
technologies
.
therefore
,
epa
is
not
persuaded
that
a
broadly
defined
household
waste
exemption
,
encompassing
large
volumes
of
commercialscale
commercial
scale
pcb
wastes
,
would
be
protective
of
health
and
the
environment
.
b
.
impact
on
recycling
activities
.
one
commenter
stated
that
the
exemption
should
include
waste
generated
by
households
but
diverted
or
removed
from
the
wastestream
for
purposes
of
recycling
.
another
commenter
stated
epa
should
control
the
recycling
and
storage
of
household
waste
(
eg
,
increase
the
storage
timeframe
from
1
to
2
years
.
the
final
set
of
comments
associated
with
this
category
suggested
epa
take
steps
to
encourage
municipal
collection
programs
for
pcbs
.
the
recycling
of
household
waste
contaminated
with
pcbs
surfaced
as
a
national
issue
during
198586
when
the
problem
of
pcb
contamination
in
shredder
fluff
(
ie
,
the
nonmetallic
metallic
residue
from
the
shredding
process
)
was
first
identified
.
since
that
period
,
epa
has
conducted
a
pilot
study
of
the
shredding
industry
to
ascertain
,
among
other
things
,
the
source
of
the
pcb
contamination
(
ref
.
34
.
when
the
fluff
contamination
problem
first
surfaced
,
pcb
small
capacitors
in
household
appliances
were
thought
to
be
the
source
of
the
contamination
.
therefore
,
data
search
collection
activities
were
initiated
to
determine
the
types
of
appliances
that
would
most
likely
contain
pcb
small
capacitors
.
the
results
of
these
efforts
indicated
that
pcb
small
capacitors
were
not
used
in
most
household
appliances
.
however
,
epa
determined
that
there
was
a
significant
likelihood
that
pcb
small
capacitors
could
be
found
in
room
and
central
air
conditioners
,
heat
pumps
,
furnace
blowers
,
fluorescent
lighting
ballasts
,
and
microwave
ovens
(
refs
.
32
and
33
.
as
a
result
,
many
states
have
implemented
pcb
small
capacitor
removal
programs
to
ensure
that
pcbs
are
not
intentionally
processed
during
shredding
operations
.
in
proposing
a
tsca
household
waste
exemption
,
epa
recognizes
that
some
objects
that
contain
a
pcb
component
may
inadvertently
be
shredded
,
resulting
in
fluff
containing
pcbs
.
epa
is
proposing
at

)
that
this
residue
when
tested
and
found
to
be
contaminated
at
levels
of
50
ppm

or
greater
,
but
measuring
less
than

.
however
,
shredder
residue
when
tested
and
found
to
contain
50
ppm
or
greater
pcbs
must
be
managed
pursuant
to
the
current
disposal
requirements
at

.
(

disposal
options
for
this
type
of
waste
are
proposed
at

and
discussed
at

of
this
preamble
)
under
the
current
regulations
,
the
processing
and
distribution
in
commerce
of
pcbs
is
prohibited
unless
otherwise
authorized
by
rulemaking
or
under
a
pcb
exemption
.
the
proposed
household
waste
exemption
authorizes
these
activities
for
household
wastes
containing
pcbs
.

nonhousehold

grade
appliances
containing
pcbs
,
fixtures
from

,
and
industrial
or
heavy
duty
equipment
containing
pcbs
would
continue
to
be
a
violation
of
the
pcb
regulations
.
epa
is
not
encouraging
the
processing
and
subsequent
dilution
of
pcbs
by
recycling
facilities
.
in
a
05/31/1979
,
federal
register
notice
,
epa
explained
that
the
random
disposal
of
pcb
equipment
in
municipal
solid
waste
sites
by
householders
and
other
infrequent
disposers
did
not
present
an
environmental
hazard
(
44
fr
31528
.
on
the
other
hand
,
epa
determined
that
the
disposal
of
large
quantities
of
pcb
small
capacitors
posed
a
somewhat
larger
risk
,
and
commercial
and
industrial
activities
were
encouraged
to
establish
a
voluntary

because
disposal
of
the

collected
under

a
few
commenters
stressed
the
need
to
restrict
the
applicability
of
a
household
waste
exemption
to
purely
residential
settings
in
order
to
exclude
business
activities
that
take
place
in
a

.
another
commenter
believed
the
exemption
should
be
identical
to
the
rcra
household
waste
exclusion
.
epa
has
interpreted
the
rcra
subtitle
c
rules
at
40
cfr
2614
as
limiting
the
exclusion
to
those
household
wastes
that
meet
two
criteria
:
(
1
)
the
waste
must
be
generated
by
individuals
on
the
premises
of
either
a
temporary
or
permanent
household
,
and
(

)
the
waste
must
be
composed
primarily
of
materials
found
in
wastes
generated
by
consumers
in
their
homes
.
the
rcra

)
includes
`
household

from
single

multiple
dwellings

,
and
other
residential

'
the
rcra
hazardous

program
,
in
establishing
a
household
waste
exclusion
,
acted
upon
a
congressional
intent
to
ensure
that
wastes
generated
by
consumers
in
their
households
would
be
exempt
from
the
subtitle
c
regulation
.
as
a
result
,
the

.
as
commenters
have
suggested
,
epa
is
proposing
an
exemption
under
tsca
for
the
disposal
of
household
wastes
containing
pcbs
that
is
similar
,
but
not
identical
,
to
the
rcra
exclusion
.
like
the
rcra
exclusion
,
the
tsca
exemption
would
not
include
nonresidential
residential
pcb
wastes
such
as
commercial
or
industrial
grade
appliances
containing
pcbs
,
fixtures
from
demolition
or
renovation
projects
,
and
industrial
or
heavy
duty
pcb
equipment
.
under
tsca
,
congress
sought
to
eliminate
the
use
of
pcbs
,
unless
specifically
authorized
,
by
banning
their
continued
manufacture
,
processing
,
and
distribution
in
commerce
.
however
,
congress
intended
that
the
use
of
equipment
which
contained
pcbs
in
a
totally
enclosed
manner
not
be
terminated
prior
to
the
end
of
the
equipments
useful
life
.
as
stated
earlier
,
research
conducted
by
epa
suggests
that
some
refrigerators
and
household
freezers
,
room
and
central
air
conditioners
,
heat
pumps
,
furnace
blowers
,
fluorescent
lighting
ballasts
,
and
microwave
ovens
may
contain
pcb
small
capacitors
.
the
risks
associated
with
the
disposal
of
those
items
containing
pcb
small
capacitors
in
a
random
,
geographically
dispersed
manner
by
individual
homeowners
were
considered
by
epa
in
mid1977
mid
when
it
proposed
the
pcb
small

exemption
.
epa
has
reevaluated

this
issue
twice
subsequent
to

time
and
has
determined
that
the
exemption
should
remain
in
place

the
distinction
that
epa
makes
between
the
tsca
household
waste
exemption
,
which
focuses
on
consumer
products
used
by
individuals
in
private
residences
,
and
the
rcra
household
waste
exclusion
,
which
focuses
on
consumer
activity
conducted
by
private
individuals
in
temporary
or
permanent
residences
,
is
based
on
the
continued
belief
that
the
unregulated
disposal
of
large
quantities
of
pcb
items
such
as
light
ballasts
and
pcb
small
capacitors
by
commercial
and
industrial
activities
presents
an
environmental
risk

under
rcra
,
the
risks
associated
with
consumer
activities
that
result
in
the
generation
of
hazardous
waste
do
not
change
when
the
activities
are
conducted
in
a
single
or
multiple
residence
,
hotel
,
motel
,
bunkhouse
,
ranger
station
,
crew
quarters
,
campgrounds
,
picnic
grounds
,
or
day

recreation
areas
.
these
are
all
locations
at
which
the
consumer
activity
is
of
a
type
that
would
be
conducted
in
a
residential
setting
.
for
the
pcb
household
waste
exemption
under
tsca
,
epa
believes
that
the
unregulated
disposal
by
individual
households
of
consumer
products
which
contain
pcbs
should
be
exempted
from
the
tsca
disposal
requirements
because
there
are
relatively
few
household
products
that
would
contain
pcbs
.
the
proposed
exemption
would
not
apply
to
individuals
who
reside
in
transient
settings
because
they
would
likely
not
dispose
of
household
appliances
that
would
contain
pcbs
(
eg
,
certain
refrigerators
and
household
freezers
,
room
and
central
air
conditioners
,
heat
pumps
,
furnace
blowers
,
fluorescent
lighting
ballasts
,
and

.
rather
,
equipment
containing
pcbs
obtained
for
use
in
transient
settings
would
likely
be
of
a
commercial
grade
and
disposed
of
in
quantity
.
therefore
,
the
removal
and
disposal
of
equipment
containing
pcb
small
capacitors
by
commercial
activities
and
entrepreneurial
interests
such
as
hotel
and
motel
chains
and
owners
of
multiple
unit
residential
buildings
engaged
in
repair
,
renovation
,
and
or
demolition
projects
,
would
not
be
covered
by
this
exemption
.
epa
considered
excluding
from
the
tsca
household
waste
exemption
pcb
wastes
found
in
a
homebased
home
based
business
,
but
has
determined
that
pcb
items
found
in
a
private
residence
would
likely
be
evident
in
these
smaller
business
enterprises
as
well
.
that
is
,
industrialscale
industrial
scale
manufacturing
activities
would
not
normally
be
conducted
in
a

setting
.
if
,
however
,
such
was
the
case
,
only
those
pcb
items
commonly
found
in
a
private
household
would
be
covered
by
this
exemption
.
although
epa
proposes
to
establish
an
exemption
under
tsca
for
the
disposal
of
household
waste
,
the
public
is
reminded
of
the
cercla
reporting
requirement
for
pcbs
at
40
cfr
3026
that
essentially
requires
individuals
to
contact
the
national
response
center
when
they
are
disposing
of
1
pound
or
more
of
pcbs
in
any
24hour
hour
period
in
a
nonfederally
federally
permitted
facility
.
the
tsca
household
waste
exemption
does
not
relieve
an
individual
(
ie
,
the
person
disposing
of
the
waste
and
or
the
owner
of
the
disposal
facility
)
of
the
liability
for
remediating
pcb
contamination
if
the
nonfederally
federally
permitted
disposal
facility
becomes
a
future
superfund
site
.
therefore
,
epa
is
seeking
comments
on
whether
additional
limitations
should
be
imposed
when
defining
entities
that
would
qualify
for
this
exemption

not
apply
to

(
ie
,

as
a
result
of
the
continued

on
whether
consideration
should
be
given
to
developing
authorizations
for
the

whether
additional

should
be
imposed

if
there
are
other

issues
which
should
be
addressed
in

comments
are
also
solicited
on
whether
the
proposed
authorization
should
allow
for
the
movement
and
reassembly
of
the

when
such
movement
and
reassembly
will
not
adversely
impact
the

will
not
result
in

a
modification
of
the

also
provide
examples
of
the

because

epa
believes
they

concerning
the

appears
at

regarding
the

,
commenters
contend
that

all
but
eliminates
any
opportunity
for

requirements
to
dispose

often
deprive
these
companies
of
the
economic
benefits
associated

epa
,
under
a

with
the

been
reviewing
pipeline
abandonment
plans
and
issuing
alternate
disposal
permits
for
the
decontamination
of

.
based
on
this
experience
,
epa
does
not
view
risks
of
injury
to
health
and
the
environment
from
exposure
to
pcbs
due
to
the
continued
use
of

collected
from

and
geographical
low

or
in
the

epa
solicits
comment
on
whether
the

should
require
each
pipe
in
a
temporary

area
to
be
marked
or
whether
only

based
on

gained
from

acceptable

scenarios
are
for
the
transport
of
bulk

,
chemicals
,
or

to

systems
such
as

;
as

;
as

)
in
intermittent
flow
situations
(
ie

is
less
than
20

and

;
or
as

in
addition
to
commenters
'
reactions
as
to
whether
natural
gas
pipeline
should
be
authorized
for
reuse
in
these
scenarios
,
epa
solicits
comments
on
the
other
specific
uses
for
which
this
pipe
would
be
suitable
.
the
reader
should
remember
that
the
reuse
provision
is
intended
for
contaminated
equipment
which
is
drained
of
all
free
flowing
liquid
(
ie
,
the
surface
is
dry
)
and
the
surface
contamination
is
demonstrated
to
be
less
than
100
micrograms
pcbs
per
100
square
centimeters
.
epa
is
also
proposing
a
parallel
authorization
for
the
use
of
pcbs
in
other
pipelines
or
air
compressor
systems
,
with
the
consent
of
the
regional
administrator
.
the
agency
is
aware
of
the
use
of
pcbs
as
lubricants
in
other
air
compressor
systems
not
associated
with
natural
gas
pipelines
and
believes
that
these
uses
pose
no
greater
risk
.

disposal
issues
.
.
the
disposal
of
nonliquid
liquid
,
bound
materials
,
such
as
plastic
insulating
material
containing
pcbs
found
in
electrical
cabling
and
lead
(
pb
)
cable
insulated
with
pcb
oilsoaked
oil
soaked
paper
,
were
also
identified
by
commenters
to
the
anprm
as
issues
that
are
not
adequately
addressed
by
the
current
regulations
.
since
the
anprm
,
epa
has
also
received
comments
addressing
the
disposal
requirements
for
the
relatively
small
quantity
of
waste
generated
during
the
chemical
analysis
of
pcbs
.
a
.
disposal
of
pcbbound
pcb
bound
material
.
one
commenter
requested
that
epa
designate
these
materials
as
unregulated
for
disposal
.
the
pcb
concentration
encased
in
this
solid
plastic
insulating
material
ranges
from
less
than
50
ppm
to
500
ppm
pcbs
.
the
commenter
argues
that
nonliquid
liquid
,
bound
pcb
materials
are
distinct
from
liquid
pcbs
and
that
the
current
exemption
at
761
60
)
that
allows
persons
,
except
manufacturers
,
to
dispose
of
pcb
small
capacitors
in
municipal
landfills
should
be
extended
to
cover
manufactured
items
containing
nonliquid
liquid
,
bound
pcb
materials
.
alternatively
,
the
commenter
argues
that
the
pcb
bound
plastic
insulation
should
be
treated
as
`
other
pcb
articles
'
having
a
pcb
concentration
between
50
and
500
ppm
pursuant
to
the
current
761
60
.
the
commenter
suggests
that
these
bound
pcb
materials
should
be
viewed
as
having
been
drained
of
free
flowing
liquid
and
should
be
treated
as
unregulated
for
disposal
under
that
section
.
however
,
epa
is
proposing
provisions
at
761
62
to
address
the
disposal
of
pcb
nonremediation
remediation
wastes
using
one
of
four
options
:
incineration
,
chemical
waste
landfill
,
municipal
solid
waste
landfill
,
or
a
disposal
method
approved
by
the
regional
administrator
.
under
this
provision
,
the
regional
administrator
could
approve
an
alternate
disposal
method
based
,
among
other
things
,
on
technical
,
environmental
,
or
wastespecific
waste
specific
characteristics
or
considerations
indicating
that
the
disposal
method
would
not
pose
an
unreasonable
risk
of
injury
to
health
or
the
environment
.
epa
believes
that
this
provision
would
provide
the
flexibility
being
sought
by
the
commenter
,
and
that
expansion
of
the
current
exemption
would
therefore
be
unnecessary
.

disposal
of

.
another
commenter
informed
epa
of
leadsheathed
lead
sheathed
cable
containing
pcbs
in
the
oilsoaked
oil
soaked
paper
that
is
used
to
wrap
the
copper
conductors
;
the
pcb
levels
typically
range
from
50
to
500
ppm
with
some
levels
reported
as
exceeding
100000
ppm
.
discarded
lead
cable
is
potentially
stored
for
long
periods
of
time
,
pending
changes
in
the
metals
market
,
and
then
ultimately
sent
to
scrap
yards
where
the
metal
is
removed
and
sold
to
recycling
operations
.
the
scrap
yards
then
burn
the
pcbsoaked
pcb
soaked
paper
without
regard
to
its
pcb
content
.
this
may
result
in
illegal
disposal
and
site
contamination
by
pcbs
,
dioxins
,
and
dibenzofurans
.
further
,
cables
that
are
not
contained
in
a
conduit
are
often
abandoned
in
place
.
the
cable
is
ripped
out
to
a
convenient
point
,
cut
,
and
abandoned
with
no
protection
at
all
for
the
cut
end
.
the
pcbcontaining
pcb
containing
oil
will
often
leak
,
as
free
flowing
oil
,
from
the
paper
when
the
cable
is
cut
or
the
covering
damaged
,
thereby
creating
environmental
concerns
when
cable
runs
are
abandoned
or
old
cable
is
improperly
stored
or
disposed
of
.
according
to
the
information
submitted
by
the
commenter
,
lead
cable
is
used
in
high
voltage
distribution
of
electric
power
,
typically
5000
volts
and
above

provided
the

is
serviced
(
including
rebuilding
)
only
with

this

comments
are

on
whether
epa
should
include
electrical

under
the
proposed

or
expand

all
electrical
cable

as
electrical

encased
with

epa
also
welcomes
information
on
any
other
electrical
cable
containing
pcbs
,
including
its
uses
,
pcb
concentrations
,
and
potential
risks
of
exposure
to
workers
,
the
general
public
,
and
the
environment
.
for
example
,
highvoltage
high
voltage
cable
used
in
underground
coal
mines
may
have
been
manufactured
with
pcbs
in
the
conductor

.
in
1954
,
the
us
.
bureau
of
mines
published
fireresistance
fire
resistance
standards
for
underground
electrical
equipment
.
in
addition
to
requiring
nonflammable
flammable
liquid
[
eg
,
pcb
dielectric
fluid
]
in
liquidfilled
liquid
filled
transformers
,
the
bureau
also
published
a
fire
test
procedure
which
was
mandatory
for
`
trailing
cables
'
or
electric
cables
that
are
reeled
out
the
back
of

,
highvoltage
high
voltage
mining
equipment
such
as
continuous
miners
and

(

.
the
fire
resistance
test
was
considered
prudent
because
trailing
cables
,
which
lie
on
the
mine
floor
,
are
often
damaged
by
equipment
travel
and
can
short
out
,
causing
an
electrical
fire
.
while
the
bureau
did
not
specify
how
such
cable
should
be
made
,
experience
with
naval
vessels
indicates
that
such
cable
could
have
been
manufactured
with
pcbs
to
meet
the
test
standards
.
some
of
this
cable
may
still
be
in
use
or
may
be
abandoned
with
other
electrical
equipment
in
mine
storage
areas
or
in
closed
mines
.
an
environmental
hazard
would
exist
if
the
cable
is
improperly
disposed
of
.
a
hazard
to
workers
would
exist
from
inhalation
of
the
fumes
during
an
electrical
short
or
from
dermal
contact
when
splicing
cable
.
therefore
,
epa
is
seeking
comment
from
any
person
who
may
know
of
past
uses
of
pcbs
in
electrical
cables
.
in
response
to
concerns
raised
about
handling
lead
cable
,
epa
cannot
emphasize
strongly
enough
that
caution
must
be
exercised
when
handling
any
electrical
cable
which
contains
pcbs
.
first
,
caution
must
be
exercised
when
servicing
the
cable
to
prevent
the
inadvertent
release
of
pcbs
into
the
environment
.
in
this
instance
,
restrictions
attendant
to
the
disposal
of
lead
complicate
the
pcb
disposal
process
,
as
environmental
releases
must
be
controlled
when
separating
the
pcb
and
lead
materials
to
ensure
further
contamination
is
avoided
.
further
,
to
ensure
the
pcbs
are
not
reintroduced
into
commerce
,
the
lead
cable
must
be
decontaminated
to
remove
the
residual
pcbs
prior
to
sending
it
to
a
recycling
operation
.
the
processing
and
distribution
in
commerce
for
the
purpose
of
disposal
of
regulated
pcb
wastes
and
their
destruction
require
an
approval
(
ie
,
permit
)
from
epa
(
see

)
and
761
60
.
owners
and
operators
of
scrap
yards
who
engage
in
activities
to
decontaminate
the
cable
(
ie
,
to
remove
the
pcbs
)
and
or
destroy
pcbs
at
concentrations
of
50
ppm
or
greater
through
the
practice
of

action
and
are
conducting
these
activities
in
violation
of
the
tsca
permit
requirements
if
they
do
not
possess
a
pcb
disposal
approval
.
finally
,
owners
and
operators
of
recycling
operations
who
accept
lead
cable
containing
pcbs
for
processing
are
operating
in
violation
of
the
tsca
ban
on
processing
pcbs
if
they
have
not
obtained
an
exemption
for
their
activities
(
see
761
20

the
disposal
activities
identified
by
the
commenter
are
currently
regulated
under
the
tsca
pcb
regulations
at

and
manifesting

or
greater
.
therefore
,
from
a
regulatory
perspective
,
no
further
rules
are
required
to
address
the
disposal
of
this
cable
.
however
,
an
outreach
program
designed
to
reach
scrap
and
salvaging
operations
may
be
the
most
appropriate
mechanism
to
ensure
the
owners
and
operators
of
these
facilities
are
educated
about
their
responsibilities
regarding
the
tsca
pcb
disposal
approval
requirements
and
potential
liabilities
under

epa
decided
not

by
capacitor
manufacturers
or
pcb
article
manufacturers
in
which
the

due
to
problems
associated

,
the
expense
associated
with
their

in
reassessing
whether
steps
should

epa
determined
not
to
impose
additional

however
,
because
the
disposal
of
large
quantities
of

by
commercial
and
industrial
activities
posed
a
somewhat
larger
risk
to
the
environment
than
disposal

,
epa
encouraged
commercial

industrial
firms
to
establish
a
voluntary

disposal
program
that
would
result
in
the
disposal
of

either
a

,
then
the
entire
ballast
is
regulated
for
disposal
under
current
rules
even
if
the
internal
small
capacitor
remains
intact
and
nonleaking
.
many
facilities
are
disposing
of
light
ballasts

incinerators
to
avoid
the
potential
for
superfund
liability
should
todays
municipal

therefore
,
epa
proposes
to
include
a
statement
in

in
response
to
the
commenters
suggestion
that
the
pcb
regulations
cross
reference
the
cercla
requirements
.
since
the
publication
of

,
epa
has
received
a
tsca

petition
from
several
fluorescent
light
ballast
recyclers
and
the
hazardous
waste
treatment
council
(

the
petitioners
requested
that

epa
granted
their

and
stated
its
intention
to
initiate
a
regulatory

to
determine
whether

not
to
amend

as
noted
earlier
,
epa
has
discussed
the
disposal
and
phaseout
of
pcb
small
capacitors
in
various
rulemakings
.
in
1979
,
epa
encouraged
firms
disposing
of
large
quantities
of
pcb
small
capacitors
to
establish
a
voluntary
collection
and
disposal
program
resulting
in
the
waste
capacitors
going
to
chemical
waste
landfills
or
high
temperature
incinerators
(
44
fr
31514
,
31528
,
05/31/1979
.
in
1982
,
epa
revisited
the
issue
of
small
capacitors
,
this
time
in
regard
to
their
potential
phaseout
.
epa
concluded
that
because
many
of
these
pcbcontaining
pcb
containing
small
capacitors
are
encapsulated
and
contain
minimal
quantities
(
01
to
06
pounds
)
of
fluid
and
a
significant
amount
of
absorbent
materials
such
as
paper
,
pcbs
are
rarely
released
from
the
capacitors
during
their
use
or
from
equipment
using
the
capacitors
.
therefore
,
epa
determined
the
exposure
risks
to
humans
,
food
,
feed
,
water
,
and
the
environment
were
low
(
47
fr
37342

37349
,
08/25/1982

in
their
petition
,
petitioners
raised
a
number
of
issues
for
which
epa
is
seeking
information
regarding
the
proposed

first
,
the
petitioners
indicated
that
the
pcbs
are
not
only
found
in
small
capacitors
but
in
the
potting
material
of
fluorescent
light
ballasts
as
well
.
epa
is
seeking
data
on
the
level
of
pcbs
found
in
the
potting
materials
of
fluorescent
light
ballasts
and
whether
the
pcbs
were
in
the
potting
material
prior
to
recycling
,
ie
,
were
the
pcbs
in
the
potting
material
because
of
a
rupture
of
the
pcb
small
capacitor
.
epa
is
also
seeking
data
on
the
percentage
of
ballasts
recycled
that
contain
pcbs
in
either
a
small
capacitor
and
or
the
potting
material
,
as
well
as
the
concentration
of
pcbs
in
the
potting
material
.
epa
is
also
seeking
information
regarding
the
manufacture
of
light
ballasts
that
have
pcbs
in
their
potting
materials
,
ie
,
date
of
manufacture
,
pcb
concentration
,
etc
.
however
,
any
additional
disposal
requirements
for
fluorescent
light
ballasts
with
pcb
small
capacitors
become
moot
if
the
ballast
potting
material
contains
pcbs
.
fluorescent
light
ballasts
with
pcbs
in
their
potting
material
meet
the
definitional
requirements
of
pcb
articles
under
7613
and
the
disposal
requirements
for
such
items
are
already
prescribed
at
761

.
if
pcbs
50
ppm
are
found
in
the
potting
materials
of
fluorescent
light
ballasts
,
the
issue
of
continued
use
becomes
a
significant
problem
because
such
pcbs
are
not
authorized
for
use
under
761
30
.
however
,
pcbs
found
at
&
lt
;
50
ppm
(
and
not
the
result
of
dilution
)
in
the
potting
compound
would
qualify
the
fluorescent
light
ballast
as
an
`
excluded

'
as
defined
at
7613
.
second
,
if
epa
determines
that
additional
disposal
requirements
need
to
be
placed
on
fluorescent
light
ballasts
containing
pcb
small
capacitors
,
the
number
of
ballasts
that
may
be
disposed
of
as
municipal
solid

within
a
1year

period
needs
to
be
determined

that
any
person
may
dispose
of
up
to
25

as
household

in
a
municipal
solid

landfill
within
a
1year
year
period
from
a
single

.
the
number
25
was
chosen
because
under
cercla
the
reportable
quantity
(
rq
)
for
pcbs
is
1
pound
(
40
cfr

.
if
an
estimate
of
approximately
2/3
ounce
of
pcbs
in
each
small

is
used
,
25
small
capacitors
equals
just
over
1

or
the

.
this
number
could
be
lower
,
such
as
10

within
a
1year

period
as
the
petitioners
suggested
or
higher
,
such
as
3000

which
approximates
the
100

epa
is
seeking
information
on
the
number
of

ballasts
containing
pcb

that
should
be
allowed
to
be
disposed
of
in
a
municipal

finally
,
on
a
related
issue
,
the
petitioners
indicated
that
fluorescent
light
ballasts
containing
pcb
small
capacitors
sent
to
municipal
solid
waste
landfills
do
not
remain
intact
and
nonleaking
once
they
are
placed
in
the
landfill
.
epa
is
seeking
data
indicating
that
the
disposal
practices
at
a
municipal
solid
waste
landfill
,
such
as
compaction
,
will
cause
the
pcbs
to
leak
into
the
environment
.
if
true
,
epa
is
seeking
data
in
support
of
statements
that
the
pcbs
leaking
from
small
capacitors
in
municipal
solid
waste
landfills
can
create
a
risk
to
health
and
the
environment
through

such
information
should
include
the
degree
of
risk

that
could
be
achieved
,
the
costs
of

this

also
suggested
that

another

stated
that

addresses

moreover
,
one
commenter
suggested
epa
revise
the
definition
for
pcb
items
`
so
that
natural

pipelines
can
be
regulated
in
a
manner
more
in
line
with
the
risks
presented
'
a
review
of
the
history
of
the
regulation
of
pcbs
in
natural
gas
pipelines
is
needed
to
put
these
comments
into
perspective
.
the
use
of
pcbs
in
natural
gas
pipeline
compressors
and
in
the
liquids
found
in
natural
gas
pipeline
is
authorized
at
concentrations
below
50
ppm
(
761
30
.
the
current
authorization
does
not
extend
to
the
use
of
pcbs
in
air
compressor
units
that
are
routinely
found
at
natural
gas
compressor
stations
.
epa
believes
that
the
risk
of
exposure
associated
with
other
pcb
articles
such
as
hydraulic
equipment
are
much
different
than
the
risk
of
exposure
to
the
endusers
end
users
of
natural
gas
containing
pcbs
or
the
reuse
of
pipeline
containing
pcbs
.
in
a
final
rule
published
in
the
federal
register
on
05/31/1979
(
44
fr
31536
,
epa
authorized
the
use
,
including
servicing
,
of
pcbs
in
natural
gas
pipeline
compressors
at
levels
above
50
ppm
until
05/01/1980
.
the
authorization
was
intended
to
give
individuals
time
to
drain
and
refill
these
compressors
with
nonpcb
pcb
fluid
to
further
reduce
the
pcb
concentration
below
50
ppm
.
epa
determined
that
`
because
of
the
small
quantities
and
low
concentrations
of
pcbs
involved
,
.
.
this
authorization
will
not
result
in
exposure
to
pcbs
that
presents
an
unreasonable
risk
to
health
or
the
environment
'
in
1981
,
epa
found
that
industry
practices
continued
to
result
in
the
use
of
pcbs
in
at
least
13
natural
gas
pipeline
transmission
systems
at
concentrations
above
50
ppm
,
and
in
some
instances
above
500

,
in
violation
of
the
pcb
regulations
.
to
address
the
elevated
levels
of
pcbs
found
in
the
pipeline
systems
,
epa
implemented
remedial
plans
with
four
basic
objectives
:
(
1
)
to
contain
the
contamination
to
limited
areas
of
the
transmission
system
;
(
2
)
to
eliminate
any
further
entry
of
pcbs
into
the
system
;
(
3
)
to
remove
remaining
pcb
contamination
from
these
systems
;
and
(
4
)
to
ensure
proper
handling
of
pcbs
that
were
removed

13

originally
presumed
to
contain

levels
greater
than

data
collected
since
a
1981
compliance
program
was
implemented
showed
the
levels
to
be
,
in
fact
,
greater
than
500
ppm

this
presumption
did
not
extend
to
other
interstate

to

further
,
on
07/10/1984
(

amended
the

allow
the

rather
how

even
of
the
small

found

to

the

in

this

,
epa
is

at

to
allow
hydrocarbon
solvents
containing
less
than
50

disposal
of
waste
generated
during
the
chemical
analysis
of
pcbs
.
chemical
analysis
is
needed
to
determine
pcb
concentrations
for
the
purposes
of
determining
compliance
with
the
pcb
regulations
;
characterize
pcb
contamination
;
determine
the
effectiveness
of
various
decontamination
and
treatment
technologies
;
and
determine
pcb
levels
in
humans
and
their
food
chain
.
the
chemical
analysis
of
pcbs
includes
sample
preparation
,
sample
extraction
,
extract
concentration
,
extract
cleanup
,
addition
of
pcb
standards
,
and
instrumental
analysis
.
there
are
several
possible
wastestreams
resulting
from
the
chemical
analysis
of
pcbs
:
excess
sample
,
potentially
contaminated
drying
agent
(
anhydrous
sodium
sulphate
,
extract
solvent
removed
during
extract
concentration
(
acetone
,
hexane

methylene

glassware
,
filtering

,
extracted

,
and
excess
extract
.
in
addition
,
analytical
instrumentation
is
contaminated
and
therefore
regulated
if
regulated
pcbs
are
analyzed
.
the
relatively
small
amount
of
pcbs
extracted
in
a
sample
is
often
diluted
significantly
in
most
potential
laboratory
wastes
,
and
most
wastes
that
cannot
be
recycled
contain
materials
that
should
absorb
pcbs
.
extraction
of
small
amounts
of
pcbs
resulting
from
pcb
analysis
would
likely
be
more
burdensome
than
disposal
in
a
controlled
disposal
facility
and
would
result
in
less
reduction
in
risk
.
therefore
,
epa
is
proposing
at
761
64
special
disposal
provisions
for
laboratory
waste
.
all
samples
,
including
extracted
sample
material
,
would
remain
regulated
for
disposal
,
but
could
be
returned
to
the
site
of
generation
for
disposal
according
to
the
concentration
measured
in
the
sample
.
epa
is
also
proposing
to
permit
,
under
certain
conditions
,
the
recycling
for
reuse
of
limited
quantities
of
organic
solvents
used
in
the
chemical
analysis
process
described
above
.
this
change
would
result
in
cost
savings
to
the
laboratory
by
not
having
to
replace
used
solvent
,
that
could
otherwise
be
safely
and
economically
recycled
by
distillation
within
the
laboratory
,
and
would
also
result
in
minimization
of
laboratory
waste
solvents
for
disposal
.
in
addition
,
epa
is
proposing
to
allow
the
disposal
of
small
quantities
of
nonliquid
liquid
waste
according
to
their
existing
(
or
presumed
)
concentration
even
though
that
concentration
is
known
to
be
the
result
of
dilution
from
performance
of
chemical
analysis
.
epa
believes
that
the
relatively
small
quantity
of
these
wastes
which
are
generated
,
their
low
concentrations
of
pcbs
in
nonliquid
liquid
materials
,
and
the
significant
quantity
of
materials
in
the
nonliquid
liquid
waste
which
would
absorb
pcbs
present
make
disposal
of
these
materials
in

safe
and
economical
option

epa
believes
there
are

not

this
is
problematic
because
most
united

not

since

it
would
be
in

epa
believes

has
determined
that
large

often
are

because
they

therefore
,
epa
is
proposing
to
strengthen
the
marking
requirements
for
large
low
voltage
capacitors
to
include
those
still
in
use
.
because
of
these
identification
and
disposal
concerns

the
agency

proposing
at

that
all
pcb
equipment
in
use
containing
pcb
transformers
or
pcb
large
capacitors
be
marked

the
agency
is
also
aware
of
reports
that
pcb
capacitors
were
not
marked
because
they
were
assumed
not
to
contain
pcbs

to
clarify
what
capacitors
must
be
assumed
to
contain
pcbs
,
epa
is
proposing
to
amend
the
definition
of
`
capacitor

in

clarify
that
a
capacitor
whose
pcb
concentration
is
unknown
generally
must
be
assumed
to
contain
500
ppm

greater
pcbs

this
should
make
it
evident

definition
of

and
pcbcontaminated
pcb

electrical
equipment
the
proposed
amendment
to
the
definition
of
a
pcb
transformer
at
7613
provides
:
`
pcb
transformer
means
any
transformer
that
contains
500
ppm
pcbs
or
greater
.
a
transformer
is
a
pcb
transformer
if
:
the
nameplate
indicates
that
the
transformer
contains
pcb
dielectric
fluid
;
the
owner
or
operator
has
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
transformer
contains
pcb
dielectric
fluid
;
or
the
transformer
dielectric
fluid
has
been
tested
and
found
to
contain
pcbs
at
500
ppm
or
greater
.
a
transformer
is
assumed
to
be
a
pcb
transformer
if
:
the
transformer
does
not
have
a
nameplate
;
records
do
not
exist
that
indicate
the
type
of
dielectric
fluid
;
or
records
do
not
exist
that
indicate
the
pcb
concentration
'
in
order
to
clarify
the
current
definitions
of
`
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
electrical
equipment
'
(
specifically
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
transformer
within
this
definition
)
at
7613
,
epa
is
proposing
incorporate
into
this
definition
the
provisions
of
the
`
assumption
rule
'
in
this
preamble
to
the
pcb
to
the
pcb
ban
rule
(
44
fr
31517
,
05/31/1979
.
epa
inspectors
have
suspected
that
some
owners
of
transformers
are
abusing
the
`
assumption
rule
'
to
avoid
the
stricter
disposal
requirements
of
761
60
.
an
example
of
such
an
avoidance
technique
is
the
removal
of
the
manufacturers
nameplate
or
other
identifying
information
that
could
be
used
to
classify
a
transformer
as
pcb
.
additionally
,
the
possibility
exists
that
a
transformer
may
have
been
serviced
with
fluid
containing
500
ppm
pcbs
or
greater
.
for
purposes
of
clarification
,
`
records
'
as
used
above
refers
to
servicing
records
,
manufacturers
certifications
and
or
other
data
that
would
indicate
or
impact
pcb
concentration
.
generally
,
commenters
expressed
support
for
epas
effort
to
clarify
the
existing
definition
of
a
pcb
transformer
.
in
addition
,
the
current
definition
of
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
electrical
equipment
at
7613
which
includes
`
oilfilled
oil
filled
electrical
equipment
'
has
been
misinterpreted
to
mean
that
a
transformer
with
any
oil
in
it
could
be
assumed
to
be
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
(
50
to
499
ppm
.
to
further
clarify
this
definition
,
the
agency
is
proposing
to
add
the
word
`
mineral
'
before
the
words
`
oil
filled
.
in
addition
,
language
would
be
added
to
this
definition
which
states
that
`
a
transformer
is
assumed
to
contain
pcbs
at
500
ppm
or
greater
,
if
it
is
an
untested
mineral
oil
transformer
and
reasons
exist
to
believe
that
the
transformer
was
at
any
time
serviced
with
fluid
containing
pcbs
at
500
ppm
or
greater
'
historically
,
mineral
oil
transformers
encompassed
the
vast
majority
of
nonaskarel
askarel
transformers
;
however
,
over
time
the
types
of
nonaskarel
askarel
transformers
have
expanded
to
include
,
for
example
,
silicone
filled
transformers
.
adding
this
clarification
would
reestablish
the
agencys
intent
when
this
definition
was
added
to
the
regulation
in
august
of
1982
(
46
fr
37342
)
that
mineral
oil
filled
transformers
are
assumed
to
be
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
(
50
to
499
ppm
)
some
commenters
suggested
that
instead
of
amending
the
definition
,
the
agency
should
consider
requiring
that
these
units
be
tested
prior
to
disposal
.
others
commented
that
epa
should
provide
immunity
from
enforcement
action
to
owners
who
assumed
their
oilfilled

filled
electrical
equipment
was
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
electrical
equipment
when
it
was
later
determined
that
the
transformer
contained
pcbs
at
500
ppm
or
greater
.
while
the
costs
of
testing
have
decreased
since
1979
,
epa
is
not
proposing
to
change
its
long
standing
policy
,
which
does
not
require
testing
transformers
prior
to
disposal
,
while
the
equipment
is
in
use
.
nonetheless
,
owners
of
electrical
equipment
containing
pcbs
should
consider
verifying
the
concentration
prior
to
disposal
to
avoid
violations
of
tsca
.
in
addition
,
epa
is
not
proposing
to
issue
a
blanket
exemption
from
enforcement
action
for
use
of
a
mineral
oil
transformers
assumed
to
contain
less
than
500
ppm
pcbs
but
later
found
to
contain
pcbs
at
500
ppm
or
greater
.
the
regulations
at
761
30
)
currently
describe
procedures
for
bringing
such
transformers
into
compliance
with
the
use
authorization
provisions
.
for
example
,
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
current
use
authorization
,
all
pcb
transformers
were
required
to
have
been
registered
with
fire
response
personnel
by
12/01/1985
(
761
30
.
pcb
transformers
erroneously
assumed
to
have
been
contaminated
at
less
than
500
ppm
pcbs
must
be
registered
within
30
days
of
discovery
of
the
actual
contamination
level
with
the
required
fire
response
personnel
(
761
30
.
if
it
cannot
be
demonstrated
(
eg
,
by
the
production
of
the
receipt
from
a
registered
letter
used
to
register
the
transformer
and
signed
by
the
fire
response
personnel
)
that
,
this
registration
has
taken
place
,
then
that
pcb
transformer
is
not
authorized
for
use
under
761
30
.
the
agency
is
seeking
information
regarding
numbers
of
small
transformers
or
other
electrical
equipment
that
contains
pcbs
.
these
small
transformers
or
other
types
of
small
electrical
equipment
generally
do
not
have
nameplates
and
are
not
easily
sampled
.
some
examples
of
this
type
of
equipment
are
:
potential
transformers
,
current
transformers
,
instrument
transformers
,
grounding
transformers
,
voltage
transformers
,
and
ignition
transformers
.
these
small
transformers
can
range
in
size
from
several
inches
to
several
feet
in
height
.
such
small
transformers
can
be
filled
with
oil
,
epoxy
,
or
tarlike
tar
like
potting
compounds
that
contain
pcbs
,
or
they
could
be
`
dry
.
since
these
small
transformers
generally
do
not
have
a
nameplate
,
under
the
proposed
amendment
to
7613
they
would
have
to
be
assumed
to
be
pcb
transformers
and
would
be
subject
to
the
use
requirements
at
761
30
)
and
the
disposal
requirements
at
761
60
.
the
agency
is
also
soliciting
comments
regarding
the
disposal
requirements
that
could
be
imposed
on
these
small
transformers
or
other
similar
types
of
small
electrical
equipment
.
their
disposal
requirements
could
resemble
those
for
small
capacitors
(
eg
,
3
pounds
of
dielectric
fluid
(
761
60
)
or
could
be
expanded
to
include
the
size
(
physical
dimensions
)
or
the
total
weight
of
the
equipment
as
well
.
such
small
transformers
or
similar
small
electrical
equipment
,
meeting
the
size
or
weight
conditions
,
could
be
authorized
for
disposal
in
an
approved
chemical
waste

was
deemed

a
process
recognized
by

epa
solicited

in

on
whether
the

should
consider

such
as

to
ensure
that

not
well
received
by

in

,
most

stated
that

considering
the
low
potential
exposure
to
humans
and
the
environment
and
the
valuable
metals
that
could
be
salvaged
for

,
epa
is
proposing
to
modify
the
disposal
requirements
at
761

)
for
drained
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
electrical
equipment
by
including
this

under
the
proposed

against

finally
,

epa
requested
comment
in
the
anprm
on
the
requirement
that

be

on
these

generally
,
commenters
were
very
supportive
of
the
requirement
that
records
be
maintained
to
document
the
distribution
in
commerce
of
these
items
.
with
the
proposed
recordkeeping
requirement
at
761
180
,
epa
seeks
to
prevent
illegal
disposal
of
pcb
items
,
including
pcb
and
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
transformers
and
large
capacitors
,
by
those
who
explain
the
disappearance
of
such
items
by
claiming
a
sale
has
occurred
.
to
minimize
the
potential
for
illegal
disposal
,
epa
is
proposing
that
the
name
,
address
,
and
phone
number
of
the
parties
to
which
the
item
was
transferred
,
the
date
of
transfer
,
and
the
identifying
number
of
the
item
be
recorded
in
the
annual
document
log
for
any
distribution
in
commerce
of
a
pcb
item
(
excluding
small
capacitors
)
with
a
concentration
of
50
ppm
or
greater
.
in
addition
,
epa
suggests
that
summary
information
relevant
to
the
equipment
(
eg
,
pcb
content
,
servicing
,
and
inspection
records
)
and
its
compliance
with
applicable
sections
of
part
761
be
passed
on
to
the
new
owner
.
epa
had
anticipated
in
the
anprm
that
this
recordkeeping
requirement
would
be
imposed
pursuant
to
a
sale
.
however
,
in
order
to
avoid
claims
that
the
transaction
is
exempt
from
the
proposed
recordkeeping
requirement
because
it
involved
no
transfer
of
money
,
epa
is
proposing
to
require
that
any
transfer
of
ownership
resulting
in
the
transformer
or
other
pcb
item
being
distributed
in
commerce
,
be
included
in
the
recordkeeping
requirement
.
the
intent
behind
this
proposed
recordkeeping
requirement
is
to
identify
instances
of
illegal
disposal
hidden
behind
the
guise
of
a
transfer
of
ownership
.
as
such
,
epa
is
seeking
to
require
additional
information
on
transactions
which
result
in
the
removal
of
the
transformers
and
capacitors
from
the
property
.
in
this
proposal
,
epa
would
not
require
the
annual
document
log
to
identify
the
transfer
of
ownership
of
pcb
items
(
excluding
small
capacitors
)
with
a
concentration
of
50
ppm
or
greater
when
that
transfer
was
included
in
a
real
estate
transfer
.
for
example
,
a
company
sells
a
warehouse
and
the
surrounding
property
.
as
long
as
the
transformers
and
capacitors
were
transferred
in
the
same
transaction
as
the
real
estate
,
a
separate
log
of
the
transaction
would
not
be
necessary
.
a
few
commenters
to
the
anprm
suggested
that
the
sale
of
totally
enclosed
electrical
equipment
should
be
banned
outright
.
epa
believes
that
the
sale
or
transfer
of
totally
enclosed
pcb
items
should
not
be
banned
and
that
there
is
still
a
legitimate
need
for
such
equipment
.
however
,
epa
believes
that
additional
controls
are
needed
to
ensure
proper
disposal
of
such
equipment
.
one
commenter
stated
that
a
recordkeeping
requirement
would
be
impossible
since
not
all
pcb
items
(
eg
,
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
transformers
,
or
large
capacitors
)
are
marked
with
a
serial
number
.
although
epa
proposes
that
the
records
include
the
serial
number
of
the
equipment
,
the
absence
of
a
serial
number
should
not
preclude
epa
from
tracing
an
illegal
disposal
.
therefore
,
epa
is
proposing
that
any
internal
identification
number
that
the
company
uses
to
identify
the
specific
pcb
item
be
included
in
the
records
.
any
facility
with
pcb
items
(
excluding
small
capacitors
)
with
a
concentration
of
50
ppm
or
greater
not
equipped
with
manufacturer
identification
numbers
should
develop
some
mechanism
for
identifying
those
pieces
of
equipment
for
activities
such
as
maintenance
or
quarterly
inspections
.
the
proposal
would
require
permanent
marking
,
such
as
engraving
of
an
internal
identifying
number
in
a
prominent
location
on
the
equipment
,
as
a
means
of
identifying
this
equipment
.
absent
a
manufacturers
identification
,
the
companys
own
identification
number
would
have
to
be
documented
on
the
records
.
several
commenters
recommended
that
the
recordkeeping
requirement
be
included
in
the
annual
record
requirements
at
761
180
.
epa
agrees
that
this
would
be
an
appropriate
method
of
maintaining
the
records
of
a
transfer
of
ownership
of
a
pcb
item
(
excluding
small
capacitors
)
with
a
concentration
of
50
ppm
or
greater
.
therefore
,
epa
is
proposing
to
implement
this
requirement
by
adding

however
,
some
suggested

by
applying
the
tsca

policy
,
while
others
recommended
changes
to
the
regional

.
in
considering
these
options
,
epa
concluded
it
is
inappropriate
to
change
the
current
policy
to
address
these
issues
at
this
time
.
epas
objective
in
initiating
this
rulemaking
is
to
provide
flexibility
and
to
remove

without
weakening

.
finally

that
are
stored
for
disposal
shall
be
removed
from
storage
and
disposed
of
within
1
year
from
the
date
when
it
was
first
placed
into
storage
.
however
,
there
currently
is
no
comparable
provision
in
the
regulations
that
addresses
the
length
of
time
a
pcb
article
may
be
stored
for
reuse
.
further
,
epa
has
been
made
aware
of
situations
where
pcb
transformers
and
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
transformers
have
been
held
`
in
storage
for
reuse
'
well
beyond
a
time
when
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
the
equipment
could
be
reused
.
this
storage
is
being
done
under
the
pretext
that
the
equipment
is
being
retained
as
`
spares
'
for
critical
components
of
existing
electrical
systems
or
that
at
some
future
date
the
owner
will
service
the
unit
.
it
was
not
epas
intent
to
allow
pcb
articles
that
clearly
could
not
be
reused
due
to
their
state
of
disrepair
,
and
therefore
should
be
disposed
of
,
to
remain
in
storage
for
`
reuse
'
this
activity
constitutes
illegal
disposal
and
creates
additional
risks
of
environmental
exposure
to
pcbs
while
the
equipment
is
`
in
storage
for
reuse
'
epa
is
aware
,
however
,
that
there
are
many
legitimate
instances
which
warrant
the
storage
of
pcb
equipment
for
many
years
for
the
purpose
of
reuse
as
spares
for
critical
components
of
electrical
systems
.
these
are
typically
intact
and
nonleaking
pcb
articles
which
are
treated
as
if
they
were
in
service
.
many
comments
received
in
response
to
the
anprm
suggested
that
limiting
storage
for
reuse
would
in
effect
amount
to
a
new
use
restriction
without
any
apparent
basis
from
the
standpoint
of
protection
of
health
and
the
environment
.
nevertheless
,
epa
is
aware
of
other
situations
for
which
restrictions
are
warranted
to
minimize
potential
risks
to
the
environment
and
health
from
exposure
to
pcb
articles
which
are
being
stored
for
reuse
.
there
are
many
compelling
reasons
for
allowing
the
storage
for
reuse
of
pcb
articles
.
since
transformers
,
for
example
,
can
easily
have
an
active
service
life
of
more
than
40
years
,
disposing
of
this
equipment
prematurely
based
upon
an
arbitrary
time
limit
would
not
be
economically
prudent
nor
serve
any
environmental
goals
.
placing
such
a
piece
of
electrical
equipment
in
storage
for
reuse
to
be
used
as
a
spare
or
in
emergency
situations
is
both
prudent
and
economically
sound
.
epa
is
proposing
to
minimize
the
potential
risks
associated
with
the
storage
for
reuse
of
this
equipment
,
that
once
it
is
placed
in
storage
for
reuse
it
be
treated
as
if
it
were
in
use
(
ie
,
inservice
in
service
.
commenters
provided
a
number
of
scenarios
in
which
extended
storage
for
reuse
is
warranted
:
(
1
)
some
pcb
articles
are
designed
and
manufactured
for
very
specific
use
and
size
requirements
and
for
which
replacement
is
imperative
for
the
continued
uninterrupted
operation
of
a
facility
(
ie
,
power
rectifiers
to
convert
electrical
power
to
a
usable
form
for
specific
manufacturing
operations
,
sidemounted
side
mounted
bushings
,
etc
;
(
2
)
certain
industries
must
maintain
inventories
of
all
vintages
of
spare
equipment
,
for
example
,
owners
of
locomotive
and
stationary
pcb
transformers
often
maintain
these
units
in
storage
for
reuse
for
a
number
of
years
prior
to
reinstalling
and
reusing
the
transformer
;
(
3
)
aircraft
and
airport
operations
require
airport
safety
and
facility
operational
flexibility
and
expedient
maintenance
capabilities
;
(
4
)
changes
in
facility
ownership
or
business
transactions
may
result
in
the
premature
storage
of
some
pcb
articles
;
(
5
)
there
may
also
be
difficulties
forecasting
electrical
demand
or
specialty
needs
and
obtaining
parts
for
repair
which
are
not
readily
available
;
and
(
6
)
if
spares
of
older
designs
that
had
been
removed
from
service
for
reuse
could
not
be
maintained
,
significant
changes
to
system
design
would
be
necessary
and
inservice
in
service
equipment
would
have
to
be
replaced
.
although
epa
takes
these
many
factors
and
situations
into
consideration
,
there
are
nevertheless
,
situations
where
the
storage
for
reuse
policy
is
abused
.
this
abuse
results
,
or
has
the
potential
to
result
,
in
serious
environmental
damage
.
it
is
these
situations
which
the
agency
is
seeking
to
control
by
limiting
the
time
allowed
for
storage
for
reuse
and
imposing
other
safeguards
.
certain
types
of
businesses
,
by
their
nature
(
eg
,
brokers
,
junk
yards
,
service
shops
,
etc
,
accumulate
larger
quantities
or
volumes
of
pcbs
than
owners
or
users
(
eg
,
a
utility
or
industrial
facility
.
besides
accumulating
large
volumes
of
pcb
equipment
that
in
many
cases
are
in
disrepair
and
may
not
be
intact
and
nonleaking
leaking
,
these
businesses
have
no
intent
of
reusing
the
equipment
themselves
.
the
equipment
may
be
awaiting
repair
prior
to
some
future
resale
or
may
be
in
storage
for
`
reuse
'
prior
to
purging
for
metal
reclamation
.
in
many
cases
,
these
units
`
in
storage
for
reuse
'
remain
for
years
in
locations
that
are
exposed
to
the
elements
which
further
compromise
the
integrity
of
the
unit
.
therefore
,
epa
is
proposing
to
add
new
761
67
to
limit
storage
for
reuse
in
an
area
that
was
not
designed
,
constructed
and
operated
in
compliance
with
761
65
)
for
a
maximum
of
3
years
from
the
date
a
pcb
article
was
taken
out
of
service
or
3
years
from
the
effective
date
of
the
final
rule
,
whichever
is
later
.
pcb
articles
placed
into
storage
for
reuse
would
have
to
be
labeled
at
the
time
the
pcb
articles
were
taken
out
of
service
,
or
upon
the
effective
date
of
the
final
rule
,
and
placed
into
storage
for
reuse
.
in
addition
,
the
storage
for
reuse
of
any
pcb
article
would
have
to
comply
with
all
marking
and
recordkeeping
regulations
.
information
required
on
these
labels
would
include
the
date
the
equipment
was
placed
into
storage
for
reuse
,
or
the
effective
date
of
the
final
rule
if
the
other
date
is
not
known
,
a
projected
location
for
the
future
use
of
the
equipment
,
and
the
date
the
equipment
was
scheduled
for
repair
or
servicing
,
if
appropriate
.
individuals
would
be
required
,
upon
request
of
an
epa
inspector
,
to
provide
records
of
the
potential
use
for
the
stored
articles
,
a
description
of
any
leak
containment
precautions
,
and
the
pcb
status
(
pcb
or
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
)
of
the
pcb
article
.
pcb
articles
that
are
intended
to
be
stored
for
reuse
for
a
period
longer
than
3
years
would
have
to
be
disposed
of
unless
the
person
storing
the
pcb
article
had
requested
and
received
from
the
regional
administrator
for
the
region
in
which
the
article
is
located
a
written
approval
for
an
extension
of
the
3year
year
period
.
anyone
requesting
an
extension
would
be
required
to
do
so
in
writing
to
the
regional
administrator
no
later
than
6
months
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
storage
for
reuse
period
.
requests
for
an
extension
of
the
storage
period
must
include
the
rationale
for
exceeding
the
storage
limitation
on
an
articlebyarticle
article
by
article
basis
.
all
extension
requests
would
be
subject
to
approval
by
the
regional
administrator
and
any
conditions
the
regional
administrator
deems
necessary
to
protect
health
or
the
environment
.
a
record
of
these
evaluations
would
have
to
be
kept
at
the
storage
site
for
a
minimum
of
3
years
.
epa
also
requests
comment
on
the
inclusion
of
sitespecific
site
specific
or
nationwide
exemption
or
waiver
provisions
in
addition
to
the
proposed
waiver
provision
.
one
option
for
stored
equipment
would
be
to
reclassify
the
equipment
in
storage
for
reuse
.
epa
,
in
another
rulemaking
,
is
currently
considering
modifications
to
the
reclassification
regulations
to
facilitate
a
widespread
application
of
the
reclassification
procedures
.
such
an
approach
would
significantly
reduce
the
risk
that
might
be
posed
by
the
longterm
storage
for
reuse
of
pcb
or
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
equipment
.
pcb
equipment
that
is
reclassified
to
nonpcb
pcb
status
(
ie
,
&
lt
;
50
ppm
)
would
not
be
subject
to
any
of
the
storage
for
reuse
restrictions
proposed
today
.
epa
recommends
that
owners
and
users
or
brokers
and
servicers
of
pcb
equipment
develop
their
own
`
reuse
or
reclassification
schedule
'
to
account
for
properly
retained
equipment
.
the
schedule
should
include
a
simple
inventory
to
aid
in
monitoring
the
status
of
the
equipment
.
this
may
include
the
reclassification
schedule
and
or
the
purpose
for
storing
for
reuse
.
one
question
raised
in
response
to
the
anprm
was
whether
the
time
between
a
piece
of
equipments
removal
from
service
for
repair
and
its
return
to
the
owner
is
considered
storage
for
reuse
.
until
a
determination
is
made
that
the
piece
of
equipment
can
or
cannot
be
repaired
,
any
storage
of
that
piece
of
electrical
equipment
prior
to
such
a
determination
is
considered
storage
for
reuse
.
the
owner
of
malfunctioning
equipment
that
has
been
sent
offsite
off
site
for
repair
will
still
be
subject
to
the
1year
year
time
limit
for
storage
and
disposal
,
beginning
on
the
date
it
was
determined
the
equipment
could
not
be
repaired
.
although
service
facilities
may
hold
units
for
several
months
while
scheduling
the
unit
for
repair
,
epa
views
prolonged
storage
in
such
situations
as
an
abuse
of
the
storage
provisions
.
records
must
be
maintained
by
the

by

situations
which
warrant
an

time
limit
for

and
disposal
.
.
in
the
06/10/1991
anprm
,
epa
solicited
comments
on
whether
an
extension
of
the
1year
year
time
limit
for
storage
and
disposal
requirement
would
be
appropriate
in
situations
,
for
example
,
innovative
pcb
destructive
technologies
;
such
as
biological
treatment
technologies
that
may
take
more
than
1
year
to
achieve
acceptable
levels
;
and
the
absence
of
disposal
capacity
,
specifically
for
pcb
radioactive
wastes
.
comments
on
alternative
options
,
procedures
and
or
restrictions
for
dealing
with
such
situations
were
also
requested
.
epa
received
several
comments
,
most
of
which
supported
the
establishment
of
a
provision
which
would
allow
the
regional
administrator
for
the
region
in
which
the
material
is
stored
,
or
the
director
,
cmd
,
if
the
director
issued
the
permit
,
to
recognize
situations
which
require
more
than
the
1year
year
time
limit
for
storage
and
disposal
,
and
to
grant
an
extension
to
the
requirement
.
commenters
also
identified
other
situations
for
which
they
believe
equal
consideration
should
be
given
to
extending
the
1year
year
time
limit
for
storage
and
disposal
.
these
situations
included
:
(
1
)
technologies
,
such
as
thermal
separation
(
thermal
desorption
)
and
bioremediation
,
that
require
more
than
1
year
to
process
waste
at
a
remediation
site
;
(
2
)
limited
expedited
remedial
action
undertaken
ahead
of
the
main
remediation
effort
;
and
(
3
)
conflicting
remediation
or
disposal
requirements
associated
with
the
presence
of
certain
coregulated
regulated
wastes
from
which
the
pcbs
cannot
be
separated
(
ie
,
such
as
mine
cable
coated
with
a
solid
antifouling
fouling
compound
containing
both
pcbs
and
mercury
.
most
commenters
supported
the
grounds
for
extension
cited
in
the
anprm
(
justification
of
need
,
demonstration
that
treatment
disposal
options
are
being
pursued
,
and
the
submission
of
periodic
progress
reports
.
other
commenters
offered
variations
on
the
epa
proposal
including
:
(
1
)
modify
regulations
to
allow
doe
to
seek
an
extension
on
a
complexwide
complex
wide
,
multifacility
basis
to
address
the
pcb
radioactive
waste
situation
and
to
submit
reports
on
a
biennial
basis
;
(
2
)
for
pcb
radioactive
wastes
,
also
require
compliance
with
alara
principles
;
(
3
)
use
a
letter
rather
than
the
permit
process
as
the
mechanism
for
granting
extensions
;
(
4
)
make
the
extension
effective
upon
submission
of
the
request
,
or
alternatively
,
make
the
extension
automatic
if
the
agency
does
not
object
within
90
days
;
and
(
5
)
eliminate
the
1year

,
the

could
grant
additional

of

.
third
,
epa

where

,
when

or
a

to

(

however
,
epa
is
less
receptive
to
allowing

if

,

would
be
required
to
disaggregate

and
transmit

to
the
appropriate
regional

.
nonetheless
,
epa
would
consider
aggregation
of
these

on
a

basis
for

by
the
regional

for
the

finally
,
under
the
proposal
epa
may
impose
conditions
when
approving

these
conditions
would
vary
due
to
the
specifics
of
each
situation
.
therefore
,
it
is
not
possible
to
list
every
conceivable
requirement
that
could
be
imposed
on
a
facility
in
granting
additional
or
longer
extensions
.
epa
is
proposing
that
the
regional
administrator
or
the
director
,
cmd
,
may
require
any
information
deemed
necessary
to
ensure
protection
of
health
and
the
environment
,
and
may
likewise
require
that
additional
steps
be
taken
during
the
storage
period
,
such
as
marking
,
inspection
,
recordkeeping
or
financial
assurance
or
complying
with
alara
principles
for
pcb
radioactive
wastes
to
protect
health
or
the
environment
.
epa
wishes
to
make
a
distinction
between
those
situations
for
which
an
extension
of
the
storage
and
disposal
requirement
may
be
legitimate
(
see
example
(
3
)
above
)
versus
those
situations
that
would
result
in
the
abuse
of
such
an
extension
,
such
as
the
acceptance
of
pcb
wastes
in
excess
of
the
capacity
limitations
imposed
either
by
the
permit
or
the
physical
constraints
of
the
technology
being
used
.
epa
does
not
believe
an
extension
of
the
storage
and
disposal
requirement
is
warranted
because
of
failure
to
initiate
attempts
to
obtain
disposal
capacity
,
the
cost
of
disposal
,
or
to
allow
for
the
aggregation
by
multiple
generators
of
pcb
wastes
into
one
vehicle
for
shipment
.
epa
is
not
modifying
its
view
that
pcb
wastes
should
be
properly
managed
and
disposed
of
as
quickly
as
possible
,
and
therefore
is
not
inclined
to
take
steps
that
would
relieve
the
generator
of
its
responsibility
to
remove
the
pcbs
from
the
environment
in
a
timely
manner
.
on
the
other
hand
,
individuals
engaged
in
onsite
on
site
remediation
activities
are
most
likely
conducting
those
activities
in
accordance
with
some
instrument
developed
by
epa
,
another
federal
agency
,
or
a
state
that
provides
instruction
on
what
how
the
project
is
to
be
conducted
and
when
the
project
is
to
be
completed
(
as
the
case
may
be
for
examples
(
1
)
and
(

)
above
.
in
these
instances
,
the
tsca
pcb
permit
and

may
not
apply
.
(

with

the

however
,
the

authorize
the
processing
and
distribution
in

of
pcbs
and
pcb
items
greater
than
50
ppm
for
purposes
of
disposal
.
the
agency
does
not
believe
that
there
are
significant
risks
associated
with
temporarily
storing
for
disposal
pcb
liquids
at
concentrations
greater
than
500
ppm
provided
the
waste
is
in
containers
meeting
dot
specifications
and
an
spcc
plan
is
implemented
.
in
the
anprm
,
epa
suggested
two
approaches
to
amending
the
regulations
to
allow
the
temporary
storage
of
liquids
greater
than
500
ppm
:
(
1
)
to
add
a
provision
to
allow
temporary
storage
of
liquid
with
concentrations
of
500
ppm
or
greater
at
761
65
,
or
(
2
)
to
consider
the
holding
storing
of
this
liquid
as
a
step
in
the
disposal
process
.
most
commenters
supported
the
option
of
amending
the
temporary
storage
provision
at
761
65
)
as
opposed
to
amending
the
provision
at
761
20
)
which
allows
the
processing
and
distribution
in
commerce
of
pcbs
and
pcb
items
for
disposal
.
many
commenters
also
suggested
increasing
the
30day
day
time
allotted
for
temporary
storage
.
the
agency
believes
it
is
appropriate
to
extend
the
allowance
for
temporary
storage
for
disposal
of
liquid
pcb
waste
above
500
ppm
,
but
not
beyond
the
existing
30day
day
limit
.
the
point
of
the
30day
day
temporary
storage
provision
is
to
allow
for
the
accumulation
of
waste
prior
to
shipment
to
a
disposal
facility
or
commercial
storage
facility
.
this
rationale
should
also
apply
to
liquids
above
500
ppm
,
especially
when
one
considers
the
preponderance
of
pcb
transformer
owners
who
are
opting
for
reclassification
of
these
units
.
to
have
them
build
or
ship
to
a
formal
storage
area
in
each
instance
would
be
unduly
burdensome
.
epa
is
proposing
that
the
30day
day
temporary
provision
at
761

)
be
extended
to
liquids
at
500
ppm
or
greater

adjusted

not

under

and
pcb

are
required
to
be
checked
periodically
for

and

requires
that
they
be

(

a

to
omit

and
to
circumvent
the
1year

.
therefore
,
epa
is
proposing
to
correct
this
oversight
by
replacing

and
(

the
first
addition
would
be
to
require
the
operator
to
maintain
a
record
of
the
inspections
for
leaks
,
and
cleanups
,
that
must
be
performed
under

currently
,
epa
inspectors
have
no
way
to
verify
that
unit
operators
are
complying
with
these
requirements
.
in
addition
,
epa
is
proposing
that
storage
unit
operators
keep
an
uptodate
to
date
written
inventory
or
log
of
what
they
are
currently
holding
in
their
unit
.
the
annual
log
requires
similar
information
;
but
since
it
is
an
annual
summary
,
it
does
not
reflect
what
is
actually
in
a
unit
on
a
given
day
and
thus
is
of
no
assistance
to
an
epa
inspector
performing
a
site
inspection
.
although
this
would
be
an
additional
recordkeeping
requirement
,
epa
believes
that
it
would
not
place
any
additional
burden
on
unit
operations
.
epa
believes
that
most
operators
maintain
some
sort
of
inventory
;
maintenance
of
such
is
almost
a
necessity
to
properly
manage
a
facility
,
as
well
as
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
1year
year
time
limit
for
storage
and
disposal
deadline
,
and
to
collect
data
for
the
annual
log
.
allowing
epa
inspectors
access
to
this
inventory
would
greatly
facilitate
onsite
on
site
inspections
,
particularly
at
larger
facilities
.
also
,
since
the
purpose
of
this
inventory
is
to
facilitate
onsite
on
site
inspections
,
epa
is
requiring
that
the
inventory
be
maintained
onsite
on
site
at
the
storage
unit
,
rather
than
at
a
central
facility
.
this
requirement
to
maintain
the
inventory
onsite
on

applies
only
to
this
inventory

and
affects
no

included

allow

and
eliminate
restrictions
placed

the

would
require

the

whether

would
be
in

with
the
terms
of

or
roughly
13
23

)
is
of
particular
concern
to
the
agency
.
epa
recognizes
the
public
policy
importance
of
pcb
research
;
however
,
there
is
a
need
to
maintain
a
certain
level
of
control
over
the
manufacture
of
pcbs
for
rampd
activities
.
further
,
as
more
countries
ratify
international
agreements
to
control
the
movement
of
pcbs
across
their
borders
,
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
the
united
states
to
establish
a
rule
or
policy
that
would
allow
the
indiscriminate
transboundary
movement
of
pcbs
.
epa
has
considered
the
commenters
proposal
and
in
761
80
)
is
proposing
to
grant
a
class
exemption
to
all
rampd
facilities
to
manufacture
(
including
import
)
pcbs
solely
for
the
facilitys
own

for
the
development
of
pcb
disposal
technologies
,
but
not
for
purposes
of
distributing
in

that
are
manufactured
.
for
purposes
of
this
rulemaking
provision
,
use
`

would
mean

all

related
studies
,
would
be
required
to

epa
proposes
to
limit

including
import
,
activities
to
no
more
than
454
grams
(
or
1

)

.
since
pcbs
are
generally
used
in
extremely
small
quantities
(
ie
,
micrograms
)
during
rampd
activities
,
epa
believes
,
based
on
its
experience
in
issuing
rampd
approvals
,
that
an
annual
limitation
on
the
manufacture
of
pcbs
at
no
more
than
1
pound
for
each
rampd
facility
should
be
adequate
.
individuals

in
order
to
reduce
the
paperwork
burden
of
the

epa
would
deem

would
recognize

the
goal
is
to
encourage
recognition
of
other
regulatory
authorities
and
participation
by
additional
states
to
implement
some
form
of
a

epa
was
interested
in
obtaining

on
the
perceived
impacts
of
recognizing
pcb

programs
that
are
implemented
under
either
an
expanded

(
ie
,
by
listing

)
or

(
ie
,
by
establishing
a

that
is
analogous
to
the
tsca

program
through
the
development
of
state
legislation
and
implementing

comments
were
solicited
on

other
factors
associated
with
implementing
such
a
proposal
(
eg

issues
of
national
consistency
,
policy
advantages
and
or
disadvantages
,
etc
.
many
comments
submitted
in
response
to
the
anprm
reflect
a
misunderstanding
of
the
state
enhancement
proposal
.
roughly
30
comments
were
received
on
this
issue
with
nearly
50
percent
of
the
commenters
in
favor
of
the
concept
.
those
in
favor
of
the
proposal
supported
any
reduction
in
duplicative
permitting
requirements
that
would
lower
the
cost
of

,
but
viewed
tsca
lookalike
look
alike
programs
as
the
preferred
approach
.
those
opposed
to
the
proposal
voiced
strongly
held
views
that
differences
between
federal
requirements
,
coupled
with
inconsistency
among
stateimposed
state
imposed
requirements
,
would
severely
hamper
and
complicate
compliance
efforts
,
create
confusion
,
result
in
increased
costs
to
the
regulated
community
,
and
possibly
serve
as
a
barrier
to
interstate
commerce
.
additionally
,
differences
between
the
tsca
and
rcra
requirements
were
cited
as
having
the
opposite
effect
of
alleviating
the
burden
for
the
regulated
community
in
complying
with
the
pcb
disposal
requirements
.
examples
cited
of
scenarios
where
each
of
these
disadvantages
would
be
evident
include
utilities
operating
across
state
lines
or
entities
with
interstate
activities
(
eg
,
natural
gas
transmission
companies
)
and
facilities
with
multistate
locations
.
several
commenters
questioned
epas
authority
to
establish
a
statedelegated
state
delegated
pcb
disposal
program
.
these
commenters
believe
that
tscas
legislative
history
mandated
implementation
of
the
pcb
disposal
program
at
the
national
level
,
and
that
anything
short
of
a
nationally
orchestrated
program
would
be
abdicating
epas
responsibility
.
epa
disagrees
with
the
legal
interpretation
and
believes
that
this
argument
is
not
compelling
as
a
policy
matter
since
pcb
disposal
facilities
are
currently
subject
to
both
federal
and
state
regulations
governing
pcb
disposal
.
furthermore
,
recognition
of
the
actions
of
another
authority
is
not
an
abdication
since
epa
retains
authority
to
enforce
the
tsca
pcb
regulations
.
additionally
,
one
commenter
advocated
transferring
the
pcb
disposal
program
to
the
rcra
program
,
or
totally
suspending
the
tsca
disposal
requirements
if
a
state
chooses
to
regulate
pcbs
under
their
expanded
hazardous
waste
management
program
.
the
state
enhancement
proposal
is
not
intended
to
serve
as
a
mechanism
for
`
delegating
'
epas
responsibility
for
implementing
any
of
the
statutory
requirements
of
tsca
.
federal
oversight
of
pcb
storage
and
disposal
activities
under
state
permits
would
still
be
undertaken
.
one
commenter
suggested
that
all
facilities
should
be
required
to

epa
believes
that
it

for
that
purpose

of

.
section
18
provides
,
with
a
few
exceptions
,
that
the
provisions
of

shall
not
affect
the
authority
of

to
establish
or
continue
in

regulation
of
any
chemical
substance

or
article
containing
such
chemical
substance

mixture
.
under
section
18a2
,
however
,
a
state
or
locality
is
preempted
from
regulating
a
chemical
substance
or

to
protect
against
a
risk
of
injury
to
health
or
the
environment
where
epa
has
acted
under
section
6
of
tsca
to
protect
against
such
risk
.
an
exception
to
this
preemption
provision
applies
when
the
state
regulation
concerns
a
requirement
`
described
in
'
tsca
section
6a6
,
ie
,
the
manner
or
method
of
disposal
of
a

this
provision
,
referred

to
preemption
,
is
enclosed
in
parentheses
at
the
beginning
of
section
18
,
subsection
(
2b
.
epa
has
interpreted
the
`
parenthetical
exception
'
to
mean
that
state
pcb
disposal
rules
are
not
preempted
because
they
describe
the
manner

on
the
grounds
that
the

under

are
presented
here
:
a
manufacturing
facility
which
discharged
waste
waters
into
a
river
located
adjacent
to
the
facility
discovered
pcb
contamination
in
the
soils
and
the
groundwater
of
a
nearby
residential
community
.
wells
were
drilled
and
pcbladen
pcb
laden
oil
was
found
.
prior
to
the
installation
of
oil
water
separators
in
1965
,
untreated
process
and
stormwater
flowed
into
a
brook
(
which
flows
through
the
property
)
and
the
river
.
this
facility
housed
,
among
other
things
,
a
transformer
division
,
and
from
1932
to
1977
insulating
oil
containing
pcbs
was
used
extensively
in
the
operation
of
its
transformer
plant
.
in
addition
,
hazardous
wastes
,
including
wastes
containing
pcbs
,
were
generated
as
a
result
of
these
and
other
manufacturing
processes
.
the
wastes
were
disposed
of
both
on
-
and
offsite
off
site
.
pcb
contamination
in
the
river
had
been
an
issue
since
the
late
1970s
when
studies
conducted
by
epa
and
the
two
neighboring
states
detected
pcbs
in
the
sediments
,
fish
,
and
waters
of
the
river
.
the
facility
had
obtained
a
npdes
permit
from
epa
for
discharges
into
a
navigable
waterway
(
in
early
1978
)
and
interim
status
under
rcra
in
1980
.
in
1981
,
the
facility
was
required
by
epa
and
the
resident
state
department
of
environmental
protection
(
dep
)
to
conduct
three
major
studies
focussing
on
:
(
1
)
the
hazardous
waste
disposal
practices
at
the
facility
,
(
2
)
a
determination
of
the
extent
of
onsite
on
site
contamination
,
and
(
3
)
an
assessment
of
the
pcb
contamination
and
corrective
action
alternatives
for
the
nearby
river
.
the
studies
concluded
that
sediment
along
the
river
was
contaminated
with
39000
pounds
of
pcbs
.
using
the
authority
of
the
states
superfund
law
,
the
facility
was
required
in
1981
to
install
groundwater
pumps
and
remove
pcb
containing
oil
from
the
top
of
the
groundwater
.
in
1987
,
the
facility
installed
a
slurry
wall
to
minimize
migration
of
the
pcbs
towards
the
river
.
in
1988
,
epas
regional
office
issued
a
tsca
disposal
permit
for
a
high
temperature
,
thermal
oxidizer
incinerator
for
the
destruction
of
the
oil
containing
pcbs
.
also
in
1988
,
the
facility
was
required
by
the
state
dep
to
make
necessary
repairs
at
the
dam
to
decrease
future
transport
of
pcbs
downstream
.
finally
,
in
10/19/1988
,
epa
initiated
the
corrective
action
process
under
the
provisions
of
the
hazardous
and
solid
waste
amendments
(
hswa
)
of
1984
to
rcra
.
a
draft
rcra
part
b
permit
to
initiate
cleanup
was
developed
by
epa
in
early
1989
,
and
the
final
rcra
corrective
action
permit
was
issued
in
early
1991
.
in
addition
,
epas
tsca
pcb
disposal
permitting
program
had
issued
several
rampd
permits
to
conduct
pilotscale
pilot
scale
experiments
of
the
effectiveness
of
various
bioremediation
processes
as
viable
cleanup
technologies
.
in
summary
,
the
facility
was
required
to
obtain
operating
and
air
emission
permits
from
the
state
dep
,
corrective
action
permits
from
epa
under
rcra
,
a
tsca
operating
permit
for

(
issued

,

rampd
permits
for
pilotscale
pilot
scale
experiments
(
issued
by
epa
headquarters
,
and
a
npdes
permit
for
water
discharges
.
if
the
tsca
pcb
coordinated
approval
proposal
were
a
reality
,
the
tsca
pcb
program
could
have
recognized
,
in
this
case
,
permits
that
could
have
been
issued
by
the
state
for
the
operation
of
the
thermal
incinerator
and
the
rampd
permits
for
experimental
disposal
technologies
if
the
state
elected
to
either
implement
an
expanded
pcb
program
under
its
rcra
authority
or
to
establish
a
tsca
lookalike

pcb
disposal
program
.
in
addition
,
action
taken
under
any
federal
authority
(
eg
,
rcra
or
cercla
)
to
require
remediation
of
pcb
contamination
could
also
be
recognized
as
not
posing
an
unreasonable
risk
of
injury
and
thus
suitable
for
a
tsca
pcb
coordinated
approval
.
one
commenter
,
although
supporting
the
concept
of
regulating
pcb
disposal
activities
under
an
expanded
state
hazardous
waste
program
for
stationary
technologies
,
encouraged
epa
to
maintain
centralized
control
over
pcb
mobile
technologies
.
however
,
such
an
approach
is
not
acceptable
to
epa
since
there
are
limited
situations
whereby
the
administrator
can
preempt
the
states
authority
to
regulate
pcb
disposal
activities
.
although
the
tsca
pcb
coordinated
approval
provision
would
not
require
the
owner
or
operator
of
a
mobile
,
or
multiple
,
but
identical
stationary
unit
to
obtain
a
single
approval
from
epa
,
it
also
would
not
require
the
owner
or
operator
of
such
a
unit
to
obtain
multiple
approvals
from
each
state
in
which
the
disposal
technology
will
be
used
.
the
owner
or
operator
of
a
mobile
,
or
multiple
,
but
identical
stationary
unit
may
want
to
obtain
a
tsca
coordinated
approval
to
ensure
the
federal
and
state
requirements
are
harmonized
.
a
state
may
chose
to
permit
mobile
technologies
that
will
be
used
exclusively
in
that
state
,
and
epa
would
respect
its
authority
to
do
so
.
however
,
an
approval
that
has
been
obtained
from
one
state
may
not
be
acceptable
to
epa
in
developing
a
tsca
coordinated
approval
that
is
intended
for
use
in
multiple
states
.
although
the
process
for
implementing
a
tsca
pcb
coordinated
approval
mechanism
was
not
discussed
in
the
anprm
,
epa
considered
establishing
a
selfimplementing
self
implementing
or
an
interactive
coordinated
approval
process
.
the
two
approaches
are
discussed
below
.
a
.
interactive
approach
.
epa
proposes
at
761
77
to
recognize
permits
issued
under
other
federal
laws
administered
by
epa
and
state
pcb
disposal
authorities
using
an
interactive
tsca
pcb
coordinated
approval
mechanism
.
epa
believes
the
interactive
approach
described
below
would
provide
the
agency
the
best
opportunity
to
effectively
oversee
pcb
activities
that
are
conducted
under
another
statutory
authority
.
in
addition
,
the
interactive
coordinated
approval
would
maximize
the
regional
administrators
ability
to
serve
in
a
preventative
rather
than
a
reactive
role
in
those
instances
where
unintentional
negligence
by
the
regulated
community
could
result
in
risks
of
injury
to
health
and
the
environment
from
exposure
to
pcbs
.
at
761
77
,
epa
is
proposing
to
include
as
a
condition
of
the
tsca
pcb
coordinated
approval
all
requirements
,
conditions
,
and
limitations
of
a
nontsca
tsca
permit
or
other
waste
management
document
issued
by
a
state
or
under
another
statute
administered
by
epa
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
this
rule
.
the
provision
allows
for
both
simultaneous
coordination
under
the
tsca
pcb
permitting
authority
and
the
other
state
or
federal
permitting
authority
when
a
waste
management
document
does
not
exist
and
the
subsequent
review
and
approval
(
or
inclusion
of
additional
conditions
,
if
deemed
appropriate
)
of
an
existing
waste
management
document
.
the
facility
could
commence
pcb
waste
storage
or
disposal
operations
only
after
the
regional
administrator
received
and
reviewed
a
request
for
a
tsca
pcb
coordinated
approval
that
included
a
copy
of
the
nontsca
tsca
approval
and
a
verification
that

had
submitted

,
impose

,
or
require
the
owner

operator
of

to
obtain
a
tsca
pcb
approval
.
if
,
at
any
time
during
the
facilitys
operation
under
the
tsca
pcb
coordinated
approval
the
regional
administrator
determined
that
the
facility
was
in
violation
of
any
requirement
of
the
approval
(
eg
,
failure
to
comply
with
the
tsca

in
a
manner
that
might
result
in
an
unreasonable
risk
of
injury
to
health
or
the

,
the
regional
administrator
could
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency
,
revoke
the
tsca
pcb
coordinated
approval
or
require
the
owner
or
operator
of
the
facility
to
apply
for
a
federal
tsca
pcb
approval
.
the
owner
or
operator
of
the
facility
could
continue
operations
until
the
tsca
approval
was
issued
;
however
,
a
facility
could
not
commence
operation
until
it
received
a
tsca
pcb
approval
if
it
received
a
notice
of
deficiency
from
the
region
.
the
deadline
for
submitting
the
permit
application
and
the
regional

rationale
for
requiring

would
be
reflected
in

this

several

epa
assumes
that
most
substances
or
mixtures
,
from
which
samples
will
be
taken
for
the
determination
of
pcb

by
chemical
analysis
,
will
fall
into
the
categories

with

addition
of

.
water
may
be
present
in
some
of
these
substances
or
mixtures
in
varying
amounts
and
for
various
reasons
.
the
pcb
current
regulations
do
not
require
a
specific
chemical
analytical
method
for
the
determination
of
pcb
concentrations
.
many
chemical
analysis
procedures
,
used
to
determine
pcb
concentrations
,
require
accounting
for
the
presence
of
water
in
samples
in
a
way
that
accomplishes
epas
objectives
in
this
rule
.
however
,
there
are
some
chemical
analysis
procedures
that
could
be
used
for
pcbs
,
but
that
were
developed
to
address
more
general
objectives
.
therefore
,
these
more
general
chemical
analysis
procedures
may
either
offer
several
options
for
accounting
for
water
in
samples
or
require
a
different
way
to
account
for
water
than
would
be
appropriate
for
determining
the
pcb
concentration
to
meet
the
requirements
and
intent
of
the
pcb
regulations
.
the
overall
purpose
of
the
proposed
revisions
to
7611b
)
is
to
ensure
a
consistent
and
reproducible
basis
for
determining
the
concentration
of
pcbs
in
the
pcbcontaining
pcb
containing
medium
.
such
a
basis
would
enable
the
agency
to
apply
the
pcb
rules
in
a
consistent
manner
.
to
determine
the
pcb
concentration
of
a
nonliquid
,
as
will
be
discussed
below
,
the
medium
of
concern
is
the
nonliquid
liquid
material
because
it
is
the
most
likely
repository
of
the
pcbs
.
therefore
,
any
water
in
the
sample
should
be
accounted
for
in
the
determination
of
the
pcb
concentration
of
the
sample
because
the
amount
of
water
can
significantly
bias
the
pcb
concentration
in
the
sample
.
for
liquid
samples
,
however
,
the
medium
of
concern
is
the
liquid
itself
;
therefore
,
to
determine
the
pcb
concentration
in
that
medium
,
one
may
determine
the
pcb
concentration
on
a
wet
weight
basis
.
(
for
example
,
for
water
samples
,
the
medium
of
concern
is
the
water
,
and
it
would
not
make
sense
to
exclude
the

liquid

and

`
liquid
pcbs
'
would
be
defined
in
7613
as
homogenous
flowable
material
containing
pcbs
and
no
more
than
05
percent
by
weight
nondissolved
dissolved
materials
.
the
proposed
revisions
to
7611b
)
would
require
concentrations
for
liquid
pcbs
to
be
determined
on
a
wet
weight
basis
.
`
wet
weight
basis
'
means
reporting
chemical
analysis
results
by
including
the
weight
of
all
dissolved
water
in
a
homogeneous
liquid
.
if
the
liquid
is
homogenous
,
the
pcbs
will
be
distributed
throughout
the
medium
evenly
.
for
nonhomogenous
liquid
samples
,
however
,
pcbs
are
more
likely
to
be
more
concentrated
in
one
component
of
the
sample
than
they
are
in
others
because
of
the
physical
and
chemical
properties
pcbs
possess
(
eg
,
pcbs
are
hydrophobic
.
thus
,
for
these
samples
,
the
proposal
would
require
each
phase
of
a
nonhomogeneous
homogeneous
liquid
to
be
separately
analyzed
(
on
a
wet
weight
basis
.
epa
recognizes
,
however
,
that
even
if
each
phase
of
a
liquid
sample
is
separately
analyzed
,
some
small
amounts
of
water
that
are
not
separable
may
be
found
in
a
particular
phase
(
ie
,
some
small
amount
of
water
may
be
found
in
oil
.
for
liquid
samples
containing
water
,
the
separable
water
must
be
removed
,
and
each
phase
of
the
sample
must
be
separately
analyzed
(
on
a
wet
weight
basis
.
separable
water
is
water
that
may
be
readily
physically
separated
,
eg
,
by
the
use
of
a
separatory
funnel
,
filtration
,
or
by
decantation
.
epa
notes
that
most
organic
liquids
in
which
pcbs
are
found
(
including
mineral
oil
dielectric
fluid
,
heat
transfer
fluid
,
oil
based
hydraulic
fluid
,
and
rinse
solvents
)
usually
do
not
contain
more
than
1
or
2
percent
of
nonseparable
separable
water
.
this
nonseparable
separable
water
usually
is
in
a
suspension
or
in
solution
.
since
the
amount
of
nonseparable
separable
water
is
usually
very
low
compared
to
the
amount
of
organic
liquid
,
the
effect
of
nonseparable
separable
water
on
the
concentration
of
pcbs
in
these
organic
liquids
is
relatively
small
.
thus
,
epa
believes
that
allowing
the
nonseparable
separable
water
to
be
included
in
the
analysis
would
generally
not
affect
the
regulatory
status
of
a
sample
.
when
there
is
nonseparable
separable
water
in
an
organic
liquid
,
chemical
analysts
will
normally
use
a
desiccant
to
remove
even
this
small
amount
of
nonseparable
separable
water
from
the
liquids
during
chemical
analysis
.
these
small
amounts
of
nonseparable
separable
water
are
removed
to
avoid
potential
interference
to
pcb
instrumental
response
from
water
and
potential
damage
to
the
chemical
instrumentation
.
even
though
the
small
amounts
of
nonseparable
separable
water
removed
by
desiccation
could
be
accounted
for
,
they

notes
that

even
though
the

do
not

this

would
also
be
revised
to
reflect
this
change
.
in
many
respects
,
voltage
regulators
are
designed
to
function
in
a
manner
similar
to
transformers
.
they
consume
a
small
amount
of
current
and
adjust
their
output
voltage
with
precise
limits
based
on
voltage
and
current
needs
of
the

system
.
though
the
actual
size
and
fluid
requirements
of
voltage
regulators
vary
depending
upon
precise
voltage
rating
,
age
,
and
manufacturer
,
voltage
regulators
of
less
than
100
kva
contain
approximately
30
gallons
of
fluid
and
those
over
100
kva
approximately
200
gallons
.
voltage
regulators
were
manufactured
with
mineraloil

of
which
14
percent
contained
pcbs
greater
than

equal
to
50
ppm
and
less
than
2
percent
contained
greater
than
or
equal
to
500

.
based
on
this
data
,
epa
does
not
expect
many
voltage
regulators
to
be
above
the
500
ppm
pcb
level
;
however
,
as
with
mineraloil
mineral

transformers
later
tested
and
found
to
contain
above
500
ppm
pcb
,
those
that
were
found
to
be
500
ppm
or
greater
would
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
as
transformers
at
500
ppm
or
greater
.
the
impetus
for
this
proposal
is
to
ensure
that
voltage
regulators
that
are
found
to
contain
500
ppm
or
greater
pcbs
are
properly
marked
while
in

,
their

they
are
properly
disposed

when

are
taken

as
well
as
soliciting
comments
on
this
proposed
change
in
general
,
epa
is
soliciting
comments
on
the
appropriateness
of
requiring
enhanced
electrical
protection
for

as
is
the
case
for
mineraloil
mineral

later
found
to
contain
greater
than

equal

in

soliciting
comments
on
whether
it
is
sufficient

(
renumbered

or
whether
a

subparagraph
should
be
added
to
address
this
issue
because
voltage
regulators
containing
greater
than
or
equal
to
500
ppm
pcb
should
not
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
as

if
there
are
compelling
reasons
to
treat
these

differently

,

argued

significantly
higher
degree
of

for
state
residents

emergency
response
personnel
from
the
risks
posed
by

the

while
epa
sees

epa
believes
that

use
of
pcbs
in
scientific
equipment
it
has
come
to
epas
attention
that
certain
types
of
scientific
equipment
have
historically
used
pcbs
as
a
medium
for
comparative
measurements
.
specifically
,
epa
has
been
made
aware
of
the
historic
use
of
pcbs
in
studies
of
birefringence
and
viscoelasticity
of
long
chain
polymers
(
ref
.
58
.
the
pcbs
serve
as
a
high
viscosity
medium
to
uniformly
reduce
all
movement
to
facilitate
comparisons
of
longchain
long
chain
polymers
.
these
studies
date
back
to
well
before
the
enactment
of
tsca
and
have
included
hundreds
of
thousands
of
comparable
reference
data
runs
.
other
media
could
be
used
to
replace
pcbs
in
these
instruments
,
but
none
yield
results
comparable
to
the
large
historical
reference
data
set
using
pcbs
as
reference
standards
.
while
pcbs
are
not
specifically
authorized
for
specialized
uses
in
scientific
equipment
,
it
is
epas
intent
to
authorize
at
proposed
761
30
,
their
continued
use
in
situations
where
the
pcbs
were
in
use
as
of
the
date
of
publication
of
todays
proposal
.
additional
information
is
requested
as
to
why
substitutes
are
not
available
or
otherwise
could
not
be
used
and
why
the
continued
use
of
pcbs
presents
no
unreasonable
risk
to
health
and
the
environment
.
in
order
to
add
specificity
to
this
proposed
authorization
,
epa
is
soliciting
comments
and

on
the

:
(

)
the
types
and

epa
is
proposing
to
remove

the

in
deleting
the

,
epa
proposes
to
retain
the

a

of

were
raised
by

by

other

of

clarifications
and
are
not
intended
to
result
in
changes
to
the

sections
of

.
epa
is
soliciting
comments
on
the
following
proposed
amendments
and
clarifications
to
the
pcb
namp

rule
.
a
.
small
quantity
exemption
for
solids
on
06/27/1990
(
55
fr
26204
,
epa
issued
a
correction
to
the
nampm
rule
that
among
other
things
sought
to
clarify
the
definition
of
`
commercial
storer
of
pcb
waste
'
at
7613
.
the
word
`
liquid
'
was
added
to
the
phrase
`
exceeds
500
gallons
of
pcbs
'
so
that
the
phrase
now
reads
`
exceeds
500
liquid
gallons
of
pcbs
'
this
excluded
facilities
that
were
storing
at
any
one
time
less
than
500
gallons
of
liquid
pcb
waste
from
the
need
to
seek
approval
as
a
commercial
storer
of
that
waste
.
in
a
petition
for
review
of
the
nampm
rule
,
filed
with
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
september
25
,
1990
,
the
petitioner
claimed
that
epa
acted
arbitrarily
when
it
narrowed
the
small
volume
exemption
in
the
definition
of
commercial
storer
so
that
only
storers
of
liquid
pcb
wastes
at
amounts
of
less
than
500
gallons
would
qualify
.
epa
agreed
that
there
were
certain
classes
of
businesses
(
eg
,
companies
performing
pcb
waste
treatability
studies
and
laboratories
affiliated
with
pcb
handling
companies
)
that
on
occasion
may
possess
relatively
small
quantities
of
solid
pcb
waste
generated
by
others
.
under
the
current
rule
,
these
companies
do
not
qualify
for
the
exemption
for
small
quantity
liquid
and
,
therefore
,
must
apply
for
approval
as
commercial
storers
of
pcb
waste
.
epa
agreed
there
may
be
reasons
for
establishing
a
small
quantity
exemption
for
solids
to
complement
the
rules
small
quantity
exemption
for
liquids
.
epa
also
indicated
to
the
petitioner
that
until
a
formal
amendment
to
the
rule
was
promulgated
,
no
enforcement
action
would
be
taken
against
a
facility
storing
small
quantities
of
pcb
solids
without
a
commercial
storage
approval
if
the
following
requirements
were
met
:
(
1
)
timely
notification
to
epa
of
its
pcb
waste
activities
.
(
2
)
storage
at
no
time
of
more
than
70
cubic
feet
of
pcb
solid
waste
,
the
approximate
volumetric
equivalent
of
500
gallons
.
(
3
)
compliance
with
all
other
applicable
requirements
as
set
forth
in
tsca
or
the
pcb
rules
.
this
proposed
rule
would
add
a
small
volume
exemption
for
storage
of
no
more
than
70
cubic
feet
of
nonliquid
liquid
pcbs
to
the
definition
of
`
commercial
storer
of
pcb
waste
'
at
7613
.
epa
is
soliciting
comments
on
the
appropriateness
of
this
small
volume
exemption
for
solids
and
in
particular
,
whether
70
cubic
feet
is
an
appropriate
cutoff
.
also
in
the
proposed
amendment
to
the
definition
of
commercial
storer
at
7613
,
epa
is
clarifying
a
point
on
the
change
of
ownership
or
release
of
title

wishes
to
clarify
that
there

this

that

to
be
disposed

earlier
than

to
meet

this

describes
what
wastes
,
based
on
pcb
concentration
and
factoring
in
whether
or
not
dilution
has
occurred
,
are
subject
to
the
manifesting
requirements
.
the
section
now
states
that
if
the
waste
contains
less
than
50
ppm
pcbs
,
but
comes
from
a
source
that
contained
greater
than
50
ppm
pcbs
,
the
waste
is
subject
to
the
manifesting
and
disposal
requirements
.
cited
as
an
example
is
pcb
spill
cleanup
material
containing
less
than
50
ppm
when
the
spill
involved
material
containing
greater
than
50
ppm
.
the
proposed
amendment
at
761

would
specify
that
there
is
no
manifest
requirement
for
material
currently
below
50
ppm
that
derives
from
pre04/18/1978
pre
,
spills
(
of
any
concentration
)
or
pre07/02/1979
pre
spills
less
than

ppm
.
this
is
because
(
1
)
the
material
`
as
found
'
is
below
the
regulatory
threshold
that
would
make
it
subject
to
the
disposal
requirements
of
subpart
d
,
and
(

)
the
original
spilled
material
was
either
below
or
not
subject
to
the
disposal
requirements
of
part
761
,
subpart
d
at
the
time
of
the
original
spill
.
in
addition
,
the
manifest
requirement
does
not
apply
to
material
derived
from
spills
that
have
been
decontaminated
in
accordance
with
epas
spill
cleanup
policies
.
in
other
words
,
material
containing
pcbs
that
has
been
decontaminated
to
the
policy
standards
to
a
level
below
50
ppm
would
not
be
treated
as
if
it
contained
greater
than

pcbs
for
disposal
purposes
,
and
could
be
disposed
of
in
a
municipal

this
position
is
consistent

could
apply
for

using
a
mechanism
effective

this
would
assure
that
there
would
be
no
lapse
in
financial
assurance
for
the

.
(

)
the
transferee
submitted
a

resolved
in

also
have
to
include
all

,
including
but
not

to
,
a
demonstration
that
the

were
qualified
to
engage

before

deem
it
`
complete

,
all
the
required
elements
were
included
in
the

the
application
would
also
have
to
correct

of

,
epa
would
reserve
the
right
to
deny
the
transfer
of
the
interim

status
or
final

if
upon
interim
review
of
the

epa
determined
that
the

was
not
qualified
or
was
unable
or
unwilling
to
achieve
and
maintain
its
operations
in
compliance
with
tsca
and
the
pcb

in
addition
,
a
determination
by
the
epa
regional
administrator
that
the
transfer
of
interim
status
or
final
approval
could
occur
would
not
be
determinative
of
the
final
decision
that

be
made
regarding
the
commercial
storage
application
.
epa
would
also
reserve
the
right
to
deny
any
subsequent
transfer
request
respecting
a
particular
facility
if
epa
believed
that
such
a
transfer
was
undertaken
to
avoid
the
requirement
of
seeking
a
final
commercial
storage
approval
.
the
requirements
proposed
above
would
have
to
be
met
before
epa
would
recognize
the
transfer
of
interim
status
.
for
example
,
company
`
x
'
is
interested
in
acquiring
ownership
of
company
`
y
,
which
has
interim
status
to
operate
as
a
commercial
storer
of
pcb
waste
.
if
epa
does
not
recognize
the
transfer
of
interim
status
before
company
`
x
'
takes
legal
title
of
ownership
of
the
facility
from
company
`
y
,
company
`
x
'
may
be
in
violation
of
the
commercial
storage
regulations
because
it
did
not
have
interim
status
to
operate
at
the
time
it
took
legal
title
.
to
facilitate
the
transfer
of
ownership
,
the
agency
also
solicits
comments
on
whether
a
`
new
'
application
is
entirely
necessary
.
if
,
for
example
,
the
transferee
accepted
the
contents
of
the
old
application
,
the
only
parts
of
the
application
that
would
have
to
be
amended
(
excluding
any
deficiencies
that
have
yet
to
be
corrected
)
would
be
the
financial
assurance
for
closure
,
a
new
list
of
principles
and
key
employees
,
and
the
compliance
history
of
any
business
with
which
those
individuals
had
been
affiliated
in
the
preceding
5
years
.
this
submission
of
an
`
amended
'
application
would
save
both
the
transferee
and
the
epa
time
and
money
and
ultimately
facilitate
the
transfer
process

the

it
clear
that

clarification
of
the
term
`
facility
'
in
todays
proposed
rule
,
the
agency
is
soliciting
comments
on
the
need
to
clarify
the
terms
`
facility
'
and
`
facilities
.
the
term
is
used
in
different
contexts
throughout
the
regulatory
text
of
40
cfr
part
761
.
the
impetus
for
the
agency
raising
this
need
for
a
clarification
of
the
term
arose
after
reviewing
a
section
of
preamble
language
in
the
pcb
notification
and
manifesting
rule
(
54
fr
52716
.
in
the
preamble
on
page
52722
,
column
2
,
the
discussion
focusses
on
the
requirement
for
generators
with
onsite
on
site
storage
facilities
to
notify
the
agency
of
their
pcb
waste
handling
activities
.
the
first
two
sentences
in
the
last
paragraph
read
,
`
in
submitting
their
notifications
to
epa
,
members
of
this
class
of
generator
storer
will
submit
a
notification
form
for
each
of
their
storage
areas
that
is
subject
to
761
65
.
epa
will
issue
a
unique
identification
number
to
each
notifying
storage
facility
,
and
this
identification
number
will
correspond
to
the
physical
location
of
the
facility
'
here
the
terms
`
storage
area
'
and
`
storage
facility
'
are
used
interchangeably
;
in
the
first
case
to
mean
a
particular
building
,
structure
,
cell
,
or
unit
,
and
in
the
second
instance
,
all
structures
on
contiguous
land
or
specified
piece
of
property
.
as
a
matter
of
record
,
it
was
not
the
agencys
intent
to
require
notification
for
each
storage
unit
on
the
contiguous
piece
of
property
,
which
would
result
in
multiple
,
individual
identification
numbers
for
that
property
.
the
facility
,
regardless
of
the
number
of
storage
areas
or
units
on
the
piece
of
property
,
need
only
notify
once
for
that
contiguous
piece
of
property
.
therefore
,
in
this
instance
,
the
term
facility
means
,
all
contiguous
land
and
structures
used
for
the
storage
of
pcb
waste
.
there
are
,
however
,
other
sections
of
the
pcb
regulations
where
the
term
facility
means
an
individual
unit
or
structure
;
most
notably
at
761
65
.
here
the
regulation
states
that
a
facility
used
for
the
storage
of
pcbs
and
pcb
items
shall
have
an
adequate
roof
,
walls
,
and
floor
;
continuous
curbing
with
a
minimum
6
inch
high
curb
;
no
floor
drains
or
expansions
joints
,
etc
;
and
shall
not
be
located
at
a
site
below
the
100year
year
flood
water
elevation
.
it
is
clear
in
this
instance
that
the
agency
is
not
referring
to
a
contiguous
piece
of
property
but
to
an
individual
structure
or
unit
.
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
in
40
cfr
part
761
,
the
term
facility
refers
to
the
contiguous
piece
of
property
including
the
structures
or
individual
storage
or
disposal
units
on
that
property
.
there
are
,
however
,
10
or
so
citations
in
the
pcb
regulations
where
the
term
facility
refers
only
to
the
individual
unit
or
structure
.
it
is
these
10
places
in
the
regulation
where
epa
is
proposing
to
delete
the
term
facility
and
insert
a
term
whose
definition
will
best
represent
the
agencys
intent
(
ie
,
an
individual
unit
,
structure
,
or
building

the
agency
solicits
comments
on
the
most
appropriate
term
to
convey
this
meaning
.
for
purposes
of
this
proposed
rule
,
the
term
`

will
be
used
to
indicate
this
change
in
the
proposed

the

if
it
has
inadvertently

this

the

cases
,
wage
rate
estimates
were
used
for
estimating
the
labor

the

treatment
of
costs
for
provisions
that
codify
epa
policy
.
in
several
instances
,
an
epa
policy
has
been
developed
in
response
to
new
information
received
by
epa
or
concerns
about
compliance
problems
,
and
the
proposed
rule
would
codify
these
policies
.
because
the
existing
regulations
differ
from
epas
policies
,
two
sets
of
cost
estimates
were
prepared
based
on
two
different
baselines
.
the
strict
language
of
the
existing
regulations
served
as
the
first
baseline
,
which
was
used
to
generate
cost
estimates
for
all
sections
of
the
proposed
regulations
.
actual
epa
policy
or
practice
was
used
as
the
baseline
for
29
provisions
of
the
amendments
.
in
cases
where
the
current
epa
policy
and
the
existing
regulations
do
not
differ
,
a
single
cost
estimate
was
prepared
and
applied
in
either
case
.
compliance
with
the
existing
and
the
proposed
regulations
.
all
cost
estimates
were
prepared
assuming
full
compliance
with
the
existing
and
the
proposed
regulations
,
although
in
reality
,
many
companies
are
not
in
full
compliance
with
the
existing
regulations
.
this
study
is
designed
only
to
estimate
the
costs
of
the
proposed
regulations
;
the
actions
necessary
to
achieve
compliance
with
the
existing
regulations
are
not
considered
.
treatment
of
the
effect
of
the
proposed
amendments
on
disposal
capacity
and
disposal
prices
.
the
analysis
does
not
reflect
possible
effects
of
the
proposed
amendments
on
either
disposal
capacity
or
disposal
costs
for
pcb
wastes
.
the
proposed
amendments
include
several
elements
that
could
reduce
demand
for
disposal
of
pcb
wastes
in
chemical
landfills
,
such
as
allowing
for
longer
storage
of
some
wastes
and
for
use
of
alternative
disposal
technologies
.
it
is
reasonable
to
anticipate
that
the
availability
of
alternatives
to
tsca
permitted
landfills
and
incinerators
will
lower
costs
for
disposal
at
those
facilities
.
nevertheless
,
these
market
changes
were
not
modeled
in

in

volume
of

.
in

amount
of

decline
.
discussions
with
various
industry
representatives
,
however
,
indicated
that
this
waste
stream
still
would
be
substantial

a
number
of
years

one
of
the

,

likely
to
continue
for
several
decades
.
given
that
the
time
horizon
for
waste
disposal
remains
so
long
,
a
declining
time
horizon
for
compliance
costs
or

was
not
taken
into

presents
the

for
the

regulations
under
the
two
baselines
.
the
net
cost
impact
of
the
proposed
amendments
,
using
either
current
epa
policy
or
the
epa
regulation
as
the
baseline
,
is
a
cost
savings
of
over
$
4
billion
per
year
.
this
figure
was
based
on
cost
savings
of
$
42
billion
to
$
48
billion
per
year
under
the
alternative
baselines
,
and
compliance
costs
of
$
116
million
.
as
noted
in
the
previous
section
,
these
cost
savings
would
likely
extend
indefinitely
into
the
future
.
the
difference
between
the
two
baselines
occurs
because
current
epa
policy
took
into
account
exceptional
compliance
difficulties
that
arose
when
previously
unknown
sources
of
pcb
contamination
were
discovered
.
a
strict
interpretation
of
the
existing
pcb
regulations
in
these
areas
would
have
generated
large
compliance
costs
for
various
users
of
pcbs
.
the
specific
areas
of
additional
compliance
costs
(

,
incremental
to
baseline
conditions

and
cost

the
total
incremental
costs
for
new

million
.
this
estimate
does
not
include
certain
cost
items
that
are
included
in
paragraphs
that
show
a
net

.
the
effect
of
these
additional
items
on
the
total
compliance
costs
,
however
,
is
quite
modest
.
the
compliance
cost
estimate
is
the
same
for
either
baseline
since
the
existing
regulatory
environment
does
not
influence
the
cost
of
new
requirements
.

of
the
regulatory
impact
analysis
developed
for
this
rulemaking
lists
the
sections
of
the
proposed
regulation
that
will
lead
to
additional
costs
.
six
provisions
of
the
proposed
regulations
describe
new
recordkeeping
or
reporting
requirements
for
facilities
with
pcb
equipment
or
wastes
.
the
two
most
costly
of
these
requirements
are

and
(
iv
,
which
require
recordkeeping
and
the
preparation
of
an
inventory
of
pcb
equipment
.
these
two
sections
would
generate
estimated
annual
compliance
costs
of
$
3771180
.
another
major
cost
increment
would
be
generated
by
761

,
the
disposal
of
drained
pcb
articles
.
while
the
existing
policy
did
not
regulate
the
disposal
of
these
articles
,
the
proposed
regulations
specify
acceptable
disposal
means
.
the
total
additional
costs
are
estimated
to
be
$
35
million
,
generated
primarily
by
greater
costs
for
disposing
of
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
transformers
.
most
transformers
now
are
disposed
of
via
industrial
furnace
,
but
certain
of
these
facilities
would
not
meet
the
furnace
standards
specified
in
proposed
761
60
,
and
the
furnaces
no
longer
would
be
able
to
accept
this
equipment
.
it
is
likely
that
most
of
these
pcb
articles
would
be
incinerated
or
placed
in
chemical
waste
landfills
.
costs
of
$
13
million

$
11
million
per
year
were
estimated
for

which
cover
the

pcb
large
lowvoltage
low
voltage
capacitors
and
transformers
and
the
registration
with
epa
of
pcb
transformers
in
use
,
respectively
.
many
facilities
are
estimated
to
require
4
hours
or
more
to
locate
,
mark
,
and
register
these
items
.
similarly
,
the
transformer
registration
requirement
would
require
electric
utilities
and
a
variety
of
industrial
facilities
to
submit
information
on
their
pcb
transformers
.
while
this
amendment
requires
only
the
submission
of
information
that
the
firms
should
have
readily
available
,
a
large
number
of
facilities
would
incur
some
expense
to
register
their
pcb
transformers

cost

estimated
using
either

the
areas
of
estimated
cost
savings
are
summarized
in

the
provision
expected
to
result
in
the
largest
cost
savings
(
estimated
at
slightly
over
$
4
billion
per
year
)
is
proposed
761
61
,
which
covers
the
disposal
of
remediation

when
the
existing

are
used
as
the
baseline
.
this
section
allows
an
expanded
set
of
disposal
options
and
simplified
administrative
procedures
,
where
the
existing
regulation
allowed
only
chemical
waste
landfilling
and
incineration
.
there
is
,
however
,
uncertainty
about
the
estimate
of
the
remediation
rate
(
ie
,
the
amount
of
waste
that
is
remediated
annually
;
the
variation
in
the

values
of
this
estimate
produces
a
range
for

.
the
disposal
of
nonremediation

,
covered
in

is
estimated
to
generate
another
large
annual

(
150
million
per

)
compared
to
either
the
existing

additional
substantial
cost
savings
of
the
pcb
amendments

,
and
others
)
would
be
authorized
for
use
for
the
remainder
of
their
useful
life
,
whereas
the
existing
regulations
banned
the
use
of
these
items

the
large
estimated
savings
for
this
section
are
based
on
the
estimates
of
the
number
of
buildings
with
pcb
contamination
for
which
continued
use
is
allowed
under
the
regulatory
amendments
.
the
number
of
these
locations
is
not
known
,
however
,
and
thus
cost
savings
can
only
be
roughly
approximated
.
another
provision
that
would
result
in
cost
savings
is
proposed
761

,
which
covers
the
abandonment
and
disposal
of
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
natural

pipelines
.
an
annual
cost
savings
of
close
to
$
63

is
generated
because
the
proposed
regulations
would
allow
considerably
greater
latitude
in
dealing
with
this
waste
stream
than
did
the
existing
regulations
.
under

pipelines
that
are
inaccessible
for

and
either
incineration

epa
policies
,
which
are
similar
to
the
proposed

the
annual

smaller387310

another
area
of

which
identifies
disposal
options
for

the
small
industrial
furnace
operators
handling
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
transformers
would
experience
negative
economic
impacts
as
a
result
of
the
proposed
amendments
.
it
was
estimated
that
approximately
100
industrial
furnace
operations
specialize
in
recovery
of
transformer
carcasses
.
most
of
the
businesses
are
small
,
ranging
from
owneroperated
owner
operated
units
with
fewer
than
10
employees
,
to
larger
operations
approaching

the

for
these
facilities
is
their

which
,
in
the
case
of

,
carries

through
contacts
with
a
selection
of
operators
,
their
likely
response
to
the
pcb
amendments
was
estimated
.
in
general
,
firms
would
not
be
likely
to
invest
in
the
new
furnace
equipment
that
would
meet
epa
specifications
.
the
new
equipment
is
quite
costly
and
the
high
temperatures
required
would
make
recovery
of
the
metals
impossible
.
it
was
estimated
that
,
on
average
,
these
operations
derive
approximately
15
percent
of
their
inputs
from
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
transformers
,
based
on
several
contacts
with
industry
personnel
.
the
remainder
of
their
inputs
are
nonpcbcontaminated
pcb

transformers
and
other
electrical

.
there
are
no
financial
statistics
available
through
conventional
or
other
sources
of
industry
data
that
can
provide
an
overview
of
the
condition
of
the
metal
recovery
furnace
industry
.
given
these
characteristics
of
the
affected
industrial
furnace
operations
,
the
epa
criteria
to
determine
whether
the
economic
impacts
are
significant
were
applied
.
none
of
the
first
three
criteria
shown
could
be
evaluated
,
however
,
because
they
all
are
defined
by
the
size
of
the
compliance
costs
incurred
.
the
industrial
furnace
operators
would
not
incur
direct
compliance
costs
,
choosing
instead
to
cease
handling
of
the
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
transformers
.
the
last
criterion
asks
whether
the
small
firms
will
cease
operations
.
based
on
discussions
with
industry
firms
,
it
was
estimated
that
few
operations
would
shut
down
.
as
noted
,
the
affected
pcb
transformers
represent
approximately
15
percent
of
the
inputs
for
metal
recovery
operations
.
a
corresponding
15
percent
decline
in
profits
,
while
representing
a
hardship
,
should
not
cause
many
plant
shutdowns
.
most
likely
there
would
not
be
many
firms
whose
inputs
,
owing
to
a
peculiarity
in
their
sources
of
supply
,
contain
a
much
higher
portion
of
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
transformers
than
other
firms
.
nevertheless
,
some
firms
might
experience
sharper
profit
declines
.
also
,
firms
that
are
currently
in
poor
financial
condition
could
be
weakened
further
as
a
result
of
the
amendments
and
might

therefore

now
face

disposal
facility
.
the
aggregate
economic
impact
was
estimated
for
this
provision
of
the
regulations
at
$
54
million
for
disposal
of
approximately
30
million
pcbcontaining
pcb
containing
light
ballasts
.
this
translates
to
an
average
incremental
cost
of
approximately
$
1
80
per
pcbcontaining
pcb
containing
light
ballast
,
covering
transportation
and
disposal
,
as
derived
in
the
specific
cost
estimates
for
this
provision
.
the
size
of
the
incremental
cost
incurred
on
a
specific
demolition
job
would
vary
directly
with
the
size
of
the
job
.
thus
,
relatively
small
demolition
jobs
(
those
generating
only
slightly
more
than
24
pcbcontaining
pcb
containing
light
ballasts
,
for
example
,
those
with
25
to
50
ballasts
)
would
incur
incremental
disposal
costs
of
$
45
to
$
90
(
25
to
50
times
$
1
80
.
in
contrast
,
large
demolition
jobs
,
with
thousands
of
light
ballasts
would
incur
additional
disposal
costs
of
several
thousands
of
dollars
.
thus
,
the
incremental
costs
are
distributed
among
demolition
jobs
according
to
their
size
,
and
the
incremental
costs
would
not
be
likely
to
be
a
large
percentage
increase
in
the
cost
of
demolition
jobs
.
demolition
contractors
do
not
vary
much
in
their
ability
to
handle
and
dispose
of
pcbcontaining
pcb
containing
light
ballasts
,
so
there
would
not
be
much
variation
in
the
unit
costs
of
compliance
among
firms
.
for
example
,
virtually
all
demolition
firms
would
use
commercial
waste
facilities
to
dispose
of
light
ballasts
.
this
consistency
of
impacts
among
firms
suggests
that
firms
would
not
be
able
to
compete
on
their
ability
to
dispose
of
pcb
wastes
,
and
therefore
,
would
all
face
similar
cost
increases
.
in
competitive
markets
,
where
all
firms
face
similar
cost
increases
,
the
price
of
services
should
increase
to
cover
the
increase
in
costs
.
thus
,
demolition
contractors
would
be
likely
to
pass
the
incremental
disposal
costs
to
their
customers
,
new
building
or
land
development
companies
,
and
therefore
,
would
be
able
to
mitigate
even
minor
cost
impacts
.
the
epa
criteria
on
small
business
impacts
were
applied
to
the
case
of
demolition
contractors
.
none
of
the
four
criteria
are
satisfied
,
however
,
by
the
regulatory
impacts
.
compliance
costs
are
estimated
to
be
less
than
5
percent
of
the
costs
of
production
and
less
than
10
percent
of
the
cost
of
sales
in
all
but
very
exceptional
circumstances
.
essentially
no
capital
cost
expenditures
would
be
required
of
the
affected
firms
.
finally
,
few
operations
,
if
any
,
would
likely
fail
due
to
these
regulatory
impacts
.
c
.
economic
impacts
on
other
small
businesses
.
.
small
businesses
in
other
industries
also
would
be
affected
by
the
pcb
amendments
.
these
costs
were
estimated
,
however
,
to
be
widely
distributed
among
small
firms
,
and
generally
would
be
distributed
in
proportion
to
the
level
of
pcb
disposal
activities
.
also
,
the
aggregate
costs
of
these
remaining
items
is
not
very
large
,
and
therefore
,
no
significant
impacts
on
small
businesses
are
forecast
.
among
the
businesses
potentially
affected
are
a
small
number
of
companies
that
currently
have
special
epa
approvals
to
decontaminate
various
types
of
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
equipment
,
including
pcb
transformers
,
components
of
natural
gas
pipelines
,
and
others
.
for
these
businesses
,
the
proposed
amendments
might
generate
additional
competition
because
many
more
companies
would
be
able
to
decontaminate
equipment
without
needing
to
obtain
special
epa
approval
.
it
was
judged
,
however
,
that
impacts
are
likely
to
be
modest
among
such
firms
.
the
companies
in
question
are
either
confident
that
their
clients
would
not
be
interested
in
decontaminating
their
own
equipment
(
due
either
to
the
capital
investments
required
or
the
relative
ease
of
using
outside
contractor
personnel
for
these
functions
)
or
the
pcbdecontamination
pcb
decontamination
business
represented
a
modest
portion

bulk
pcb

samples
from

may
be
composited
so
long
as
the
pcb
concentration
of
interest
(
the
clean
not
clean
level
)
is
divided
by
the
number
of
samples
in
the
composite
.
the
resulting
quotient
shall
be
called
the
`
composite
action
level
'
the
composite
action
level
eliminates
the
possibility
that
any
one
sample
in
the
composite
is
above
the
pcb
concentration
of
interest
.
631
if
the
concentration
from
the
analysis
of
the
composite
exceeds
the
`
composite
action
level
'
then
it
shall
be
assumed
that
at
least
one
sample
in
the
composite
exceeds
the
pcb
concentration
of
interest
.
6.3.1.1
for
example
,
for
bulk
pcb
remediation
waste
samples
,
if
the
concentration
of
interest
is
50
ppm
and
then
ten
samples
are
composited
and
analyzed
,
then
the
`
composite
action
level
'
is
5
ppm
.
if
the
chemical
analysis
results
indicates
less
than
5
ppm
,
there
are
no
samples
having
a
concentration
greater
than
50
ppm
(
the
pcb
concentration
of
interest
.
if
the
chemical
analysis
is
5
ppm
or
greater
then
there
may
be
at
least
one
sample
in
the
composite
having
a
concentration
exceeding
the
concentration
of
interest
and
further
sampling
and
or
compositing
is
necessary
to
demonstrate
that
no
sample
exceeds
the
concentration
of
interest
.
632
if
the
concentration
from
the
analysis
of
the
composite
is
less
than
the
`
composite
action
level
'
then
it
shall
be
assumed
that
none
of
the
individual
samples
in
the
composite
exceeds
the
pcb
concentration
of

from
nonporous
porous
samples
from
more
than
one

point
.
when
accounting
for
dilution
from
compositing
wipe
samples
,
it
is
not
necessary
to
use
samples
wiped
from
the
same
total
surface
area
so
long
as
the
`
composite
action
level
'
(
see
procedure
61
of
this
appendix
)
assumes
the
smallest
surface
area
from
any
of
the
wipe
samples
composited
.
this
difference
from
bulk
remediation
waste
sample
compositing
is
the
result
of
the
pcb
amount
reported
being
a
weight
rather
than
a
concentration
.
641
for
example
,
if
the
pcb
concentration
of
interest
is
10
g/100
cm
and
the
sample
gauze
from
three
wipe
samples
each
of
an

of
200

are
composited
with
one
sample
of
100

.
.
if
the
report
for
this
composite
showed
greater
than
10
g
,

not
result

principle
that

legislative
prohibition
bear
the

demonstrate
that

not
pose

epa
has
determined
that
pcbs
are
toxic
and
persistent
.
pcbs
can
enter
the
body
through
the
lungs
,
gastrointestinal
tract
,
and

congeners
are
among
the
most
stable
chemicals
known

pcbs
are
absorbed

organisms
as
they
bioaccumulate
up

toxicity

are
the
two

based
on

epa
concluded

to
chloracne
,
pcbs
may
cause

effects

and

in

epa
also
concluded
that

present
a

to

go
on

epa
has
determined
that
the
petitioner
has
failed
to
establish
that
there
is
no
unreasonable

as
required
in
tsca
section
6e3b
.
the
petitioner
has
not
demonstrated
how
the

outweigh
the
risks
inherent
in
the

proposed
by

believes
that
the

failed
to
demonstrate
that
it
has
made
a

determination
that

,
while

believes
that
there
is

some

inherent
in
the

of

,
the
large
quantities
that
myers

increases
the

myers
indicates
in

that
over

period
it
wishes
to
import
a
total
of
approximately
300
million

based
on
the
data
supplied
in
the
petitions
and
supplemental
information
(

,
epa
calculates
that
the

to

myers
estimates
that
an
average
truckload
for
such
waste
would
weigh
40000
pounds

using
this
estimate
,
epa
calculates
that
7500

would
be
shipped
to
talmadge
,
and
an
additional
1500
to
2250
truckloads
would
be
shipped
from

for

myers
has
failed
to
demonstrate
that
the
proposed
activity
would
not
pose
a
risk
to
health
and
environment
in
the
united

.
the
introduction
and

the

states
that

benefits
would
be

with
the
exception
of

,
however
,
myers
has
provided
revenue
information
only
with

revenue
estimates
tend
to
overinflate
the
actual
financial
benefit
to
the

.
to
properly
evaluate
the
financial
impacts
,
epa
needs
additional
information
regarding
any

that
might
offset

gross
revenues

in
addition
,
myers
has
failed
to
substantiate
its
claim
that

benefit
by
the
removal
of

that
are
stored
in

and
the
elimination
of

.
epa
acknowledges
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
some
pcbs
stored
in
canada
could
pose
some
risk
to
health
or
environment
in
the

myers
,
however
,
has
not
presented
factual
information
to
demonstrate
why

pose
such
a
risk
or
to
show
the
extent
of

and
environment
in

the
canadian
government
regulates
the
storage
and

of

in
that
country
which
should
provide
adequate
protection
against

or

proposes
to

myers
also
states
that

costs
for
canadian
companies
constitute
an
additional
benefit
of
the

.
under

,
however
,
epa
does
not
consider

that

occur

to
foreign
businesses
,
just
as
it
does
not
consider
risks
that
do
not
threaten
domestic
health
or
the
environment
.
epa
is
proposing
to
deny
myers
'
petitions
because
myers
has
failed
to
demonstrate
that
the
risks
of

are
reasonable
when
weighed
against
the
benefits
,
particularly
in
view
of
the
limited
information
available
to
substantiate
the
alleged
benefits
.
myers
contends
that
the
proposed
disposal
activities
do
not
pose
an
unreasonable
risk
by
noting
that
the
facilities
that
would
dispose
of
the
pcbs
are
permitted
by

to

60
)
authorizes
epa
to
issue
a
permit
if
the
method
of
destroying
pcbs
will
not
present
an
unreasonable
risk
of
injury
to
health
or
the
environment
.
under
this
provision
,
epa
weighs
the
risk
of
the
disposal
methodology
against
the
benefits
to
the
health
and
environment
in
the
united
states
.
the
fact
that
epa
has
determined
that
the
benefits
outweigh
the
risks
when
the
activity
involves
the
disposal
of
domestic
pcbs
that
are
already
present
in
the
united
states
,
however
,
does
not
demonstrate
that
the
benefits
outweigh
the
risks
when
the
activity
involves
disposing
of
foreign
pcbs
that
would
be
introduced
into
this
country
.
the
introduction
of
additional
pcbs
that
would
otherwise
not
be
in
the
united
states
adds
an
additional
factor
to
the
risk
benefit
equation
.
epa
further
finds
grounds
to
deny
the
petitions
based
on
the
good
faith
efforts
criteria
of
tsca
section
6e3bii
.
petition
1
maintains
that
this
criteria
is
`
not
really
applicable
'
in
that
myers
only
wishes
to
import
pcbs
for
disposal
,
and
not
for
use
in
commerce
;
however
,
the
petition
does
go
on
to
discuss
other
disposal
options
.
the
subsequent
three
petitions
simply
state
that

does
not
apply
,
and
provide
no
discussion
of

while

strictly
speaking
,
section

)
refers
to
finding
substitute
chemicals
,
epa
believes
that
under
this
section
it
must
generally
consider
the
issues
of
the
availability
of
alternatives
,
and
the
overall
necessity
for
granting
an
exemption
.
the
alternative
to
importation
of
canadian
pcb
waste
into
the
united
states
for
destruction
is
to
destroy
those
wastes
in
canada
itself
.
myers
maintains
in
petition
1
that
it
has
investigated
the
possibility
of
setting
up
a
facility
in
canada
to
recycle
destroy
pcb
transformers
,
and
it
concluded
that
it
would
be
uneconomical
and
politically
difficult
to
establish
a
facility
in
canada
.
however
,
myers
fails
to
demonstrate
that
establishing
a
facility
in
canada
is
not
feasible
;
rather
,
myers
only
forwards
arguments
as
to
why
doing
so
is
less
expedient
and
less
profitable
for
myers
than
importing
the
waste
to
its
existing
facility
in
the
united
states
.
myers
does
not
provide
any
evidence
that
it
made
substantial
good
faith
efforts
to
pursue
such
an
option
before
it
petitioned
the
agency
for
this
exemption
.
more
importantly
,
canada
already
possess
a
domestic
disposal
facility
,
and
is
in
the
process
of
expanding
its
pcb
disposal
resources
.
there
are
no
technological
barriers
to
the
effective
destruction
of
pcbs
in
canada
that
would
necessitate
their
shipment
to
the
united
states
for
safe
disposal
.
myers
has
not
demonstrated
the
necessity
for
the
pcbs
in
question
to
be
imported
to
the
united
states
for
disposal
,
and
accordingly
epa
finds
that
all
four
petitions
have
failed
to
meet
the
good
faith
efforts
criteria
.
although
myers
has
not
submitted
adequate
information
to
allow
the
agency
to
make
the
requisite
findings
for
these
four
specific
exemptions
to
import
canadian
pcbs
for
disposal
,
epa
is
considering
whether
to
amend
existing
pcb
disposal
rules
to
modify
the
general
restriction
on
the
import
of
pcbs
with
50
ppm
or
greater
for
disposal
.
epa
believes
that
opening
the
border
to
allow
import
for
disposal
may
have
farreaching
far
reaching
consequences
and
that
it
is
preferable
to
raise
the
issue
of
the
transboundry
movement
of
pcb
waste
generally
in
the
proposed
disposal
rules
rather
than
to
examine
it
in
isolation
in

.
in
the
proposed
disposal
rules
,
epa
is
requesting
comment
on
the
circumstances
under
which
the
united
states
border
should
be
opened
to
the
transboundry
shipments
of
pcbs
for
disposal
.
the
proposal
,
if
finalized
,
would
retain
the
general
prohibitions
on

of

of
50
ppm

greater

epa
proposes
to
deny
this
exemption

epa
has
determined
that
,
in
general
,
the
import
(
manufacture
)
of
pcbs
into
the
united
states
and
the
distribution
in

present

and
how

accordingly
,
epa
cannot
make
the
finding
that
granting
this
petition
will
not
present
an
unreasonable
risk
of
injury
to
health
or
the

.
in

,
epa
finds
that
the

has
failed
to
satisfy

criterion
,
ie
,
dgc
has
not
demonstrated
that
there
is
no
viable
alternative
to
importing

into

according
to
the
canadian
association
for
environmental
analytical
laboratories
,
there
are
laboratories
within

capable
of
conducting
pcb
analysis
.
the
petition
does
not
provide
any
details
on
the
unidentified
us
.
laboratorys
techniques
,
why
the
canadian
laboratories
are
unable
to
provide
such
analysis
,
or
why
developing
such
technologies
would
take
canadian
laboratories
so
long
.
further
,
the
petition
fails
to
justify
how
the
shipment
of
individual
laboratory
samples
to
the
united
states
will
expedite
the
cleanup
of
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
sites
in
canada
:
cleanup
of
these

will
not
occur
until
the
canadians
develop
their
own
domestic
ability
to
apply
such
technologies
in
situ
on
a
large
commercial
scale
.
epa
notes
that
the
primary
reason
it
closed
the
border
in
1980
was
to
encourage
foreign
countries
to
develop

on
06/14/1993
,
jaco
(

submitted
an
exemption
petition
to
import
oil
samples
from

from
canadian

to
test
for

,
and
to
return
(
export
)
to
the

any

that
test
positive
for

following

on

amended
its
petition
and
notified
epa
that

has
been
acquired
by

.
a
.
current
petition
.
the
sample
sizes
would
be
25
milliliters
per
sample
of
oil
.
these
samples
would
then
be
analyzed
for
pcb
content
.
following
their
analysis
,
waste
oil
499
ppm
or
less
would
be
recycled
in
a
high
efficiency
boiler
at
big
stone
utility
;
and
waste
oil
500
ppm
or
greater
would
be
sent
to
aptus
for
incineration
.
jaco
estimates
that
based
on
a
submittal
rate
of
50000
samples
per
year
,
the
total
volume
of
pcbs
to
be
imported
would
be
6
gallons
.
jaco
maintains
that
historical
laboratory
data
indicates
that
less
than
5
percent
of
the
samples
are
in
the
pcb
classification
(
over
50
ppm
.
in
addition
,
jaco
estimates
that
their
volume
of
waste
oil
greater
than
499
ppm
would
only
increase
by
3
gallons
annually
.
during
analysis
,
jaco
states
that
the
1
microliter
injected
into
the
gas
chromatograph
(
gc
)
is
destroyed
in
the
destructive
detector
and
the
residual
oil
from
this
process
contains
no
pcbs
since
the
extraction
process
removes
the
pcbs
from
the
oil
.
further
,
the
94
milliliters
of
224trimethylpentane
trimethylpentane
that
is
used
in
the
extraction
process
and
remaining
after
the
gc
sample
is
run
,
is
separated
from
the
acid
and
reclaimed
in
a
distillation
process
for
reuse
.
this
recycling
of
the
solvent
used
in
the
extraction
eliminates
the
need
for
solvent
disposal
.
jaco
states
that
the
economic
consequences
of
denial
would
be
greater
for
the
canadian
utilities
.
in
their
petition
,
jaco
indicates
that
canadian
utilities
currently
pay
$
100
per
sample
,
while
jacos
cost
is
$
15
per
sample
.
jaco
maintains
that
denial
of
their
petition
would
limit
the
growth
of
jaco

4
additional
jobs
)
and
the
number
of

the
petitioner
maintains
that

be
distributed

will
not
exceed
500
,
at
less
than

the
petitioner
also
states
that
through
a
customer
screening
procedure
,
the
pcbs
would
be
handled
by
qualified
personnel
and
should
not
present
a
risk
of
injury
to
health
or
the
environment
.
the
petitioner
estimates
that

100000

epa
proposes
to
grant
the
sigmaaldrich
sigma
aldrich
an
exemption
for
1
year
to
export
small
quantities
of
pcbs
for
research
and
development
under

.
the
agency
generally
treats
petitions
for
exemption
to
export
pcbs
more
stringently
than
petitions
to
distribute
pcbs
within
the
united
states
.
this
is
because
once
the
pcbs
cross
beyond
our
borders
,
the
united
states
loses
its
ability
to
monitor
the
handling
and

activities
,
to
inspect
the

for
any
regulatory
violations
,
or
to
protect

from
releases
of
those
pcbs
that
might
lead
to
additional
pcb
contamination
in

however
,
epa
believes
that
those
concerns
are
mitigated
in
the
export
of
pcbs
in
small
quantities
for
research

particularly
given
the
viscosity

as
well
as
the
careful
handling
of

the

seek
to
process
and

the

kit
to
42
of
their
international
distribution

the

an
immunoassaybased
immunoassay

test
kit
for
the
analysis
of

processes
and
distributes
in

small
quantities
of
pcbs
under
the

at

the

.
the
envirogard

is
an
analytical
test
kit
that
is
used
by
trained
professional
chemists
and
engineers
who
are
involved
in
the
remediation
of
pcbs
.
the
petitioners
predict
that
250
to
500
kits
will
be
sold
overseas
per
year
.
based
on
these
numbers
each
kit
would
contain
67
micrograms
of
aroclor
1248
in
03
milliliters
of
methanol
,
yielding
a
total
of
0

of
aroclor
1248
in
75
to
150
milliliters
of
methanol
exported
in
a
year
.
the
petitioners
state
that
the
kits
will
expand
existing
conventional
technologies
such
as
gas
chromatography
and
mass
spectroscopy
by
offering
a
safe
,
reliable
,
economic
,
and
expedient
way
of
screening
negative

from
positive
samples
.
positive
samples
are
later
confirmed
with
conventional
techniques
and
are
disposed
of
in

with
applicable
regulations
.
there
are
no
substitutes
available
which
can
be
used
to
accurately
determine
the
presence
of
pcbs
,
since
known
concentrations
of
pcbs
must
be
used
in
the
calibrators
that
contain
known
concentrations
of
pcbs
.
the
petitioners
estimate
that
the
cost
of
denial
of
this
petition
could
cause
a
loss
in
revenue
amounting
to
$
0
25
million

states
that
he
seeks
to
use
a
procedure
that
converts
car
shredder
waste

into

a

using

from

company
which
he
states
is
considered
one
of
the
most
contaminated
sites
in
the
country
where
50000
tons
of
contaminated
material
has
been
stockpiled
.
based
on
the
50000
tons
of
contaminated
material
,
mr

kraemer
estimates
that
10000000
lbs

will
be
processed
onsite
at
a
concentration
of
30
ppm
pcbs
,
for
a
total
of
300
lbs
of
pcbs
.
mr
.
kraemer
also
asserts
that
the
pcb
contamination
is
not
the
result
of
shredding
appliances
,
motors
and
transformers
or
pcb
items
,
but
is
actually
attributable
to
the
use
of
plastics
and
finishes
in
products
.
the
petitioner
maintains
that
due
to
the
low
concentrations
and
the
anticipated
nonfriable
uses
,
that
any
release
of
pcbs
to
the
environment
is
unlikely
.
in
addition
,
the
petitioner
states
that
the
predictable
and
anticipated
level
of
inadvertently
generated
pcbs
in
any
end
product
will
be
kept
under
25
ppm
;
therefore
,
the
manufacturing
or
processing
for
commercial
purposes
of
products
with
pcb
concentrations
of
less
than
50
ppm
should
be
excluded
from
the
prohibitions
of

.
the
petitioner
states
that
he
does
not
see
a
need
for
any
special
labelling
,
disposal
and
recordkeeping
requirements
,
since
he
is
not
producing
a
pcb
item
,
article
,
equipment
or
container
.
the
petitioner
states
that
denial
of
this
petition
would
eliminate
a

million
(

savings
for
the

and
a
potential
$

in
profit
.
if
the
exemption
is
granted
and
the
process
is
successful
,
the
petitioner
states
that
it
would
generate
employment
,
eliminate
a
hazardous

,
recycle
a

conserve

the

the
carefully
controlled
conditions

epa
finds
that
no

would
result
from
granting
an
exemption
to
chemsyn

this
finding
also
applies
to
the
import
of

provided
that
the
imported
samples
are
prepared

epa
finds

as
such
,
epa
does
not
believe
that
the
importation

when
compared
with
their
domestic
manufacture
,
would
pose
any
added
risk
to
health

the
agency
generally
treats
petitions
for
exemption
to
export
pcbs
more
stringently
than
petitions
to
distribute
pcbs
within
the
united
states
.
this
is
because
once
the
pcbs
cross
beyond
our
borders
,
the
united
states
loses
its
ability
to
monitor
the
handling
and
distribution
activities
,
to
inspect
the
receiving
facilities
for
any
regulatory
violations
,
or
to
protect
health

environment
from
releases
of
those
pcbs
that
might
lead
to
additional
pcb
contamination
in
this
country

however
,
epa
believes
that
those
concerns
are
mitigated
in
the
export
of
pcbs
in
small
quantities
for
research

given
the
quantity

of
the

as
well
as
the
careful
handling
of
the

by

pure

epa
acknowledged
that

,
many
transformers
could
not
be
repaired
promptly
and
equipment
users
could
experience
interruptions

easa
maintained
that
the
introduction
of
doublerinsed
double
rinsed
,
nonporous
porous
component
parts
back
onto
the
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
transformers
would
not
change
the
original
parts
per
million
pcb
content
of
the
transformer
into
which
the
component
part
is
incorporated
.
epa
concluded
that
the
processing
and
distribution
in
commerce
of
the
pcb
residues
on
nonporous
porous
,
doublerinsed
double
rinsed
transformer
component
parts
as
well
as
the
buying
and

of
pcb
or

transformers
that
have
been
serviced
with
doublerinsed
double
rinsed
,
nonporous
porous
parts
,
meets
both
the
no
unreasonable
risk
and
good
faith
effort
criteria
.
epa
granted
this
class
exemption
for
1
year
.
epa
decided
that
in
future
requests
for
renewal
of
their
(
easa
)
exemption
,
that
epa
would
consider
the
petitioners
evidence
of
no
unreasonable
risk
and
good
faith
efforts
by
evaluating
whether
stockpiles
of
component
parts
have
been
effectively
decontaminated
and
also
whether
inventories
of
pcb
and
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
transformers
in

contained

areas
have
been
reduced

current
petition

.
in
this
petition
easa
seeks
to
renew
their
exemption
to
process
and
distribute
in
commerce
for
reuse
nonporous
porous
component
parts
from
pcbcontaminated
pcb
contaminated
transformers
that
have
been
double
washed
rinsed
as
granted
in
the
05/22/1990
fr
21023
.
easa
has
submitted
two
additional
reports
from
t
r
service
company
to
support
that
the
double
wash
rinse
method
is
effective
to
decontaminate
nonporous
porous
components
.
as
described
in
the
renewal
petition
,
one
report
showed
that
20
samples
were
taken
from
10
transformers
and
all
showed
pcb
concentrations
of
less
than
10
micrograms
per
100
square
centimeters
.
on
06/12/1990
the
petitioner
stated
that
it
surveyed
its
members
and
of
those
that
responded
,
only
20
percent
were
still
handling
mineral
oil
transformers
50
ppm
or
greater
.
in
the
petitioners
opinion
the
number
of
members
with
inventories
of
50
ppm
to
less
than
500

has
decreased
significantly

proposed
decision
on

epa
proposes
to
grant
easas

for

of

epa
believes
that
easa
has
fulfilled
their
responsibility
in
seeking

renew
their
exemption
by
demonstrating
efficacy
,
a
reduction
in

and

the

under

of

this
rule
,
under
section
6e3b
)
of
tsca
,
would
exempt
persons
from
these
prohibitions
where
petitioners
have
demonstrated
that
granting
an
exemption
would
not
result
in
an
unreasonable
risk
of
injury
to
health
or
the
environment
and
that
they
have
made
good
faith
efforts
to
develop
substitutes
for
pcbs
.
both
small
and
large
businesses
must
meet
the
same
statutory
standard
.
thus
,
even
if
epa
believed
that
it
was
an
economically
desirable
policy
to
grant
an
exemption
petition
for
a
small
business
,
it
could
do
so
only
if
the
small
business
met
the
requirements
set
forth
in
tsca
.
this
rule
would
not
add
to
the
burden
placed
on
small
businesses
,
it
would
only
remove
the
prohibition
placed
on
such
businesses
through
granting
an
exemption
.
in
essence
,
any
impact
from
granting
or
denying
a
petition
would
only
affect
the
petitioner
.
owners
of
individual
small
businesses
who
elect
to
petition
the
administrator
to
engage
in
activities
otherwise
banned
by
the
statute
have
already
considered
the
economic
consequences
of
conducting
these
activities
,
and
nonetheless
have
opted
to
pursue
an
authorization
for
these
activities
.
finally
,
because
this
rule
basically
would
benefit
some
small
entities
,
without
imposing
direct
economic
costs
on
others
,
epa
believes
that
it
is
appropriate
to
certify
that
this
rule
will
not
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
