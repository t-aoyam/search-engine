this

would
help
protect
persons

property
at
airports
and
aboard
aircraft
against
terrorist
and
other
criminal
acts
by
strengthening
the
rules
protecting
sensitive
security
information
from
being
released
to
unauthorized
persons
.
it
would
require
the
affected
entities
to
be
responsible
for
safeguarding
this
security
information
from
unauthorized
disclosure
.
the
accidental
divulgence
of

material

to

,
the
loss
of

,
and
or
the

these

given
the
