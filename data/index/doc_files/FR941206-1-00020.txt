the

it

inconsistent

the
basic

expected
of

represented
as
having
been
made
from

essentially
intact

labeling
fsis
is
proposing
special
provisions
for
the
labels
of

if
adopted
,
these
provisions
would
supplement

,
more
general
requirements
for
such

(

subpart

the
provisions
are

the
product
.
fsis
is
proposing
the
following
labeling
provisions
for
msk
:
(
1
)
the
name
of
the
product
(
eg
,
`
mechanically
separated
(
kind
'
must
be
followed
immediately
by
the
phrases
)
`
made
from
fowl
'
unless
it
is
not
made
,
in
whole
or
part
,
from
mature
female
chickens
,
and
`
with
excess
skin
'
unless
it
is
made
from
poultry
product
that
does
not
include
skin
in
excess
of
the
natural
proportion
present
on
the
whole
carcass
;
and
(
2
)
there
must
be
appropriate
descriptive
terminology
in
the
labeling
of
msk
)
if
heat
treatment
has
been
used
in
the
preparation
of
such
product
,
eg
,
`
cooked
'
because
the
characteristics
described
in
(
1
)
and
(
2
)
above
are
ones
which
would
affect
the
use
of
msk
,
fsis
is
proposing
that
,
in
order
to
assure
compliance
with
regulatory
requirements
and
thereby
prevent
the
adulteration
and
misbranding
of
finished
poultry
products
and
meat
food
products
,
such
characteristics
must
be
clearly
identified
on
the
label
when
msk
)
leaves
the
establishment
at
which
it
is
manufactured
.
as
indicated
previously
,
the
regulations
already
require
that
information
on
use
,
including
deviations
from
the
natural
whole
carcass
proportion
of
skin
as
well
as
the
fact
of
cooking
,
appear
on
the
label
of
boneless
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
(
9
cfr
381
117
.
the
presence
of
skin
or
its
presence
in
excess
of
the
natural
whole
carcass
proportion
would
,
as
discussed
previously
,
continue
to
affect
product
use
if
the
regulations
are
amended
.
the
use
of
heat
treatment
in
the
preparation
of
the
product
also
would
be
of
continuing
relevance
(
9
cfr
381
157
.
in
addition
,
since
the
presence
of
poultry
kidneys
or
sex
glands
can
affect
use
(
9
cfr
319
180
,
a
number
of
manufacturers
of
msk
)
not
containing
these
parts
currently
choose
to
note
this
fact
on
the
label
.
the
other
information
that
would
be
required
is
identification
of
product
made
from
fowl
.

.
finished
poultry
products
and
meat
food
products
.
as
indicated
above
in
the
discussion
of
fsis
'
proposed
definition
and
standard
for
msk
,
fsis
is
proposing
that
in
view
of
the
differences
between
msk
)
and
poultry
products
produced
by
traditional
handdeboning
hand
deboning
techniques
,
msk
)
should
be
regulated
as
a
distinctive
ingredient
with
standardized
characteristics
.
therefore
,
fsis
is
proposing
to
define
such
product
by
its
own
name
,
eg
,
`
mechanically
separated
(
kind
'
that
would
be
declared
in
the
ingredients
statements
on
finished
product
labels
by
the
name
specified
in
its
definition
and
standard
.
fsis
recognizes
the
importance
of
the
identification
of
the
calcium
and
cholesterol
content
of
msk
)
to
consumers
who
,
according
to
the
comments
received
on
the
06/15/1993
,
anpr
(
58
fr
33040
,
indicated
a
desire
to
know
of
the
presence
of
calcium
and
cholesterol
.
the
nutrition
labeling
regulations
,
effective
07/06/1994
,
require
mandatory
declaration
of
calcium
and
cholesterol
content
on
most
processed
meat
and
poultry
products
which
addresses
this
particular
labeling
concern
.
fsis
believes
that
nutrition
labeling
is
the
most
appropriate
vehicle
for
conveying
a
products
nutrient
content
,
which
includes
calcium
and
cholesterol
,
as
well
as
other
nutrient
information
.
