in
evaluating
options
that
the
industry
could
use
to
comply
with
the
proposed
standards
,
the
committee
tried
to
ensure
that
the
compliance
options
would
impose
a
minimum
burden
on
small
businesses
.
for
example
,
the
proposed
standards
do
not
require
the
use
of
control
devices
that
require
a
significant
capital
investment
and
impose
an
unfair
burden
on
small
businesses
that
typically
have
trouble
raising
capital
.
small
businesses
can
meet
the
emission
limits
for
finishing
materials
and
adhesives
through
the
use
of
compliant
materials
.
the
committee
tried
to
ensure
that
the
recordkeeping
and
reporting
requirements
of
the
proposed
standards
were
not
beyond
the
resources
of
small
businesses
.
the
committee
also
evaluated
whether
the
proposed
work
practice
standards
presented
any
particular
problems
to
small
businesses
.
some
members
felt
that
developing
an
operator
training
program
might
pose
some
problems
to
small
businesses
.
rather
than
exempt
small
businesses
from
what
the
committee
feels
is
a
key
work
practice
,
the
committee
decided
to
recommend
that
small
businesses
work
together
to
develop
a
training
program
.
the
committee
also
suggested
that
large
businesses
that
already
have
training
programs
in
place
could
share
the
key
components
of
those
programs
with
small
businesses
.
finally
,
the
committee
recommended
that
state
small
businesses
assistance
programs
assist
small
businesses
in
developing
their
training
program
.
the
small
business
work
group
made
several
recommendations
to
the
committee
,
including
a
recommendation
that
the
epa
draft
a
document
that
would
provide
guidance
to
small
businesses
on
how
to
obtain
a
federallyenforceable
federally
enforceable
limit
on
their
potential
to
emit
and
recordkeeping
requirements
that
might
be
associated
with
the
limit
.
in
addition
,
small
business
representatives
proposed
that
the
epa
draft
a
memorandum
responding
to
questions
developed
by
the
small
business
work
group
pertaining
to
area
sources
that
become
major
sources
.
the
small
business
work
group
also
recommended
that
the
epa
discuss
in
the
preamble
the
benefits
of
general
permits
for
small
businesses
and
encourage
their
use
where
appropriate
.
the
agency
agreed
and
a
discussion
of
general
permits
is
included
in
section
vil
.
the
small
business
work
group
also
recommended
that
the
epa
,
in
conjunction
with
the
state
of
north
carolina
small
business
ombudsman
office
,
develop
an
information
outreach
program
to
serve
as
a
resource
for
small
wood
furniture
manufacturers
.
the
agency
has
agreed
to
work
with
the
north
carolina
small
business
ombudsman
office
to
develop
this
program

the

the

to
meet
the

pursuant
