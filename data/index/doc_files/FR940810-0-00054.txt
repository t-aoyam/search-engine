osha
reiterates
its
statement

however
,
the
need
for
onsite
on

supervision
varies
with
the
hazard
potential
of
the
work
undertaken
.
all

must
have
continuous

supervision
for
class
ii
and
iii
work
does
not
always
require
a
continuous
onsite
on

`
competent

'
therefore
the
standard
requires

`
sufficient

intervals
and
at

request
.
supervision
of
installation
of
asbestos

explanation
of
provisions
of
the
final
standards
the
following
is
a
provisionbyprovision
provision
by
provision
discussion
of
the
revised
asbestos
standards
.
thus
all
the
provisions
in
all
three
standards
:
general
industry
,
construction
and
shipyard
employment
,
relating
to
a
topic
will
be
discussed
under
the
heading
for
that
topic
.
for
example
,
under
the
scope
heading
,
the
scope
of
the
general
industry
standard
will
be
first
discussed
,
then
the
scope
of
the
construction
standard
,
and
finally
the
scope
of
the
shipyard
employment
standard
.
similarly
,
under
the
methods
of
compliance
heading
,
the
provisions
in
each
standard
relating
to
that
topic
will
be
discussed
.
where
a
discussion
applies
to
all
three
or
to
two
of
the
separate
standards
it
will
be
so
noted
and
will
not
be
repeated
for
each
standard
.
osha
believes
that
this
format
will
help
the
public
understand
where
and
why
the
various
standards
contain
different
provisions
relating
to
the
same
subject
matter
.
further
,
it
will
avoid
repetition
in
explanations
where
a
common
policy
rationale
applies
to
more
than
one
asbestos
standard
.

the

they
may

place
at

the
