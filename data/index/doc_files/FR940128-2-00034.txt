dear
dr

prabhakar
:
this
letter
is
written
on
behalf
of
the
motor
and
generator
section
of
nema
to
request
that
the
national
institute
of
standards
and
technology
establish
a
laboratory
accreditation
program
(
lap
)
for
electric
motors
through
the
national
voluntary
laboratory
accreditation
program
.
the
purpose
of
the
program
will
be
to
accredit
testing
laboratories
to
certify
that
standard
test
methods
for
product
performance
(
and
not
safety
)
are
properly
followed
in
testing
electric
motors
.
standard
test
methods
and
related
performance
standards
will
be
those
developed
through
such
accredited
standardsmaking
standards
making
organizations
as
nema
and
the
institute
of
electrical
and
electronics
engineers
,
inc
.
the
development
of
a
nvlap
program
on
energy
efficient
motors
will
be
beneficial
to
industry
in
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
energy
policy
act
(
epact
)
of
1992
regarding
electric
motors
.
the
epact
requires
that
certain
types
and
sizes
of
electric
motors
meet
minimum
efficiency
standards
and
that
a
program
be
established
to
verify
the
efficiencies
.
a
nvlap
program
will
assure
that
data
used
to
verify
motor
efficiencies
are
measured
in
competent
testing
laboratories
.
the
nvlap
program
on
energy
efficient
lighting
,
developed
in
response
to
a
previous
request
by
nema
,
will
serve
as
a
model
for
a
program
on
electric
motors
.
the
nema
motor
and
generator
section
is
willing
to
assist
the
national
institute
of
standards
and
technology
in
identifying
and
obtaining
the
necessary
technical
resources
to
establish
the
accreditation
program
.
please
give
this
request
your
immediate
attention
.
