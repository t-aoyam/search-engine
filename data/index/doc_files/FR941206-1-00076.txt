the
work
practice
work
group
explored
the
methods
currently
being
used
by
facilities
in
the
source
category
to
control
hap
emissions
from
cleaning
and
washoff
.
they
used
the
survey
responses
collected
by
the
epa
and
the
industry
group
,
the
experience
of
personnel
from
a
state
office
of
waste
reduction
on
the
work
group
that
had
worked
with
wood
furniture
manufacturers
,
and
the
experience
of
those
involved
in
the
manufacture
of
products
in
one
or
more
of
the
industry
segments
.
the
work
practice
work
group
concluded
(
and
the
committee
concurred
)
that
there
were
work
practices
in
use
by
existing
facilities
in
the
source
category
to
limit
emissions
from
washoff
operations
and
each
major
cleaning
activity
:
gun
line
cleaning
,
spray
booth
cleaning
,
and
general
cleaning
activities
.
i
.
gun
line
cleaning
.
the
cleaning
of
spray
guns
and
of
lines
that
carry
finishing
material
,
solvent
,
and
adhesives
from
storage
to
the
spray
guns
is
a
common
practice
in
wood
furniture
operations
.
cleaning
is
necessary
so
that
dried
resins
or
other
materials
do
not
build
up
in
the
lines
or
spray
equipment
.
the
frequency
of
cleaning
varies
by
plant
depending
on
the
different
types
of
material
sprayed
with
a
given
gun
,
the
extent
to
which
a
gun
is
used
,
and
other
plantspecific
plant
specific
factors
.
typically
,
a
gun
is
cleaned
each
time
it
is
used
to
spray
a
different
material
.
if
a
gun
is
dedicated
to
one
type
of
finishing
material
(
eg
,
topcoat
,
cleaning
frequency
may
be
reduced
.
the
practice
of
dedicating
a
gun
to
a
particular
coating
type
is
not
common
,
however
,
especially
at
smaller
shops
that
have
fewer
spray
stations
.
one
work
practice
that
the
work
practice
work
group
agreed
could
be
universally
applied
was
the
collection
of
solvent
used
for
cleaning
in
a
container
that
can
be
closed
.
for
example
,
if
a
line
is
flushed
,
the
cleaning
solvent
could
be
collected
into
a
normally
closed
container
.
another
work
practice
that
the
work
practice
work
group
agreed
could
be
easily
implemented
is
the
covering
of
cleaning
solvent
containers
when
not
in
use
.
as
discussed
for
storage
containers
associated
with
finishing
and
gluing
operations
,
such
a
practice
is
straightforward
and
inexpensive
.
ii
.
spray
booth
cleaning
.
in
addition
to
the
emission
limits
identified
for
strippable
spray
booth
coatings
in
table
3
,
the
work
practice
work
group
believed
that
the
proposed
rule
should
prohibit
the
use
of
organic
solvents
for
spray
booth
cleaning
except
in
limited
circumstances
.
sources
subject
to
this
rule
could
comply
by
using
strippable
spray
booth
coatings
that
meet
the
voc
limits
identified
in
table
3
,
thereby
reducing
the
use
of
organic
solvents
for
this
purpose
.
the
work
practice
work
group
acknowledged
that
there
were
instances
in
which
solvent
was
necessary
.
specifically
,
it
was
agreed
that
conveyors
carrying
furniture
or
furniture
components
through
the
spray
booth
and
continuous
coaters
and
their
enclosures
could
continue
to
be
cleaned
with
solvent
.
likewise
,
organic
solvent
can
continue
to
be
used
to
clean
the
metal
filters
located
in
the
spray
booth
.
neither
the
work
practice
work
group
members
nor
the
rest
of
the
committee
members
were
aware
of
substitute
materials
that
could
be
used
for
cleaning
this
equipment
,
or
of
any
strippable
coating
such
as
the
coating
that
is
available
for
the
spray
booth
walls
.
additionally
,
industry
representatives
pointed
out
that
small
tears
and
holes
may
be
generated
in
the
strippable
booth
coating
during
the
manufacturing
process
.
in
these
cases
,
some
staining
of
the
spray
booth
walls
may
occur
.
the
committee
agreed
that
sources
could
use
small
quantities
of
solvent
,
no
more
than
1
gallon
per
booth
,
to
clean
these
areas
when
the
strippable
booth
coating
was
being
replaced
.
iii
.
furniture
washoff
.
another
area
of
concern
that
the
work
practice
work
group
focused
on
was
a
practice
known
in
the
industry
as
washoff
.
washoff
is
the
practice
of
removing
coating
from
a
piece
of
furniture
or
a
furniture
component
.
the
main
reason
for
washoff
is
that
the
finish
does
not
meet
company
specifications
.
by
washing
off
the
coatings
,
the
substrate
can
be
refinished
.
washoff
is
typically
accomplished
by
dipping
the
furniture
into
a
tank
containing
organic
solvent
;
the
same
solvents
used
for
cleaning
are
usually
used
for
washoff
.
the
work
practice
work
group
agreed
that
there
were
some
measures
that
sources
could
implement
at
almost
no
cost
that
could
limit
emissions
from
washoff
.
as
with
finishing
and
other
cleaning
operations
,
the
work
practice
work
group
agreed
that
covering
washoff
tanks
when
they
are
not
in
use
would
limit
emissions
.
also
,
sources
could
minimize
dripping
by
tilting
and
or
rotating
the
piece
to
drain
as
much
solvent
as
possible
back
into
the
tank
.
iv
.
general
cleaning
washoff
activities
.
during
the
work
practice
work
group
discussions
,
it
was
apparent
that
cleaning
and
washoff
practices
are
not
well
documented
by
sources
.
for
example
,
most
sources
do
not
know
the
quantity
of
solvent
used
for
cleaning
and
washoff
operations
,
how
many
pieces
are
washed
off
,
and
the
fate
of
spent
solvent
from
cleaning
and
washoff
operations
.
the
work
practice
work
group
agreed
that
one
of
the
first
steps
in
reducing
emissions
is
to
know
the
quantity
of
solvent
used
for
the
various
operations
onsite
.
only
then
can
a
source
identify
operations
that
are
wasteful
or
inefficient
.
therefore
,
the
work
practice
work
group
proposed
that
the
work
practices
in
the
proposed
rule
require
a
cleaning
and
washoff
solvent
accounting
system
.
under
this
system
,
sources
would
have
to
:
1
.
maintain
a
log
of
the
quantity
and
type
of
solvent
used
for
washoff
and
cleaning
,
the
number
of
pieces
washed
off
,
and
the
reason
for
the
washoff
;
2
.
record
the
quantity
of
spent
solvent
generated
from
each
activity
,
and
its
ultimate
fate
either
onsite
or
offsite
;
