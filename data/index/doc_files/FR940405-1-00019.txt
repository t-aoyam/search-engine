summary
:
this
document
proposes
the
adoption
of
a
new
airworthiness
directive
(

)
that
is
applicable
to
certain
de
havilland
model
dhc8100
dhc
and
dhc8300
dhc
series
airplanes
.
this
proposal
would
require
a
revision
to
the
airplane
flight
manual
(
afm
)
to
advise
flight
crew
members

certain
cockpit
indications
may
reveal
faulty
anticollision
collision
strobe
light
units
,
and
to
provide
procedures
for
subsequent
flight
crew
action
.
this
proposal
would
also
require
a
modification
that
eliminates
the
need
for
the
afm
revision
.

proposal
is
prompted
by
reports
that
the
function
of
the
proximity
switch
electronics
unit
(
pseu
)

be
adversely
effected
during
operation
of
the
white
anticollision
collision
lights
.
the
actions
specified
by

proposed
ad
are
