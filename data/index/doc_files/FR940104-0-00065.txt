(
test
methods
for
evaluating
solid

methods
)
in
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
,
the
agency
proposed
to
add
method
4010
(
immunoassay
test
for
the
presence
of
pentachlorophenate
)
to
the
second
and
third
editions
of
sw846
.
the
purpose
behind
this
proposal
was
to
aid
owners
operators
of
wood
surface
protection
plants
with
the
proposed
formulation
testing
requirement
.
with
respect
to
requiring
the
use
of

methods
for
testing
for
the
presence
of
pentachlorophenate
in
wood
surface
protection

formulation
,
the
issue
is
moot
since
epa
is
not
listing
any
wood
surface
protection
wastes
as
hazardous
.
nonetheless
,
epa
believes
that
although
no
comments
were
received
on
method
4010
,
method
4010
is
an
appropriate
method
,
in
general
,
for
testing
for
the
presence
of
pentachlorophenate
or
pentachlorophenol
and
can
,
therefore
,
be
used
in
other
applications
other
than
for
wood
surface
protection
formulation
testing
.
the
agency
is
,
therefore
,
adding
method
4010
to
the
third
edition
of
sw846
as
update

.
we
are
not
adding
method
4010
to
the
second
edition
of
sw846
since
the
third
edition
has
replaced
the
second
edition
on

pollution
prevention
and
waste
minimization
the
agency
is
preparing
a
separate
guidance
manual
recommending
voluntary
pollution
prevention
and
waste
minimization
techniques
for
the
lumber
industry
.
since
it
has
studied
the
surface
protection
industry
in
making
a
listing
determination
for
wastes
generated
from
the
use
of
chlorophenolic
formulations
,
epa
has
gained
a
broad
perspective
on
the
best
ways
to
reduce
wastes
generated
by
this
wood
surface
protection
industry
.
the
ideas
gained
from
the
study
are
presented
in
this
manual
.
some
recommended
strategies
for
pollution
prevention
in
the
surface
protection
industry
are
described
in
this
section
.
further
information
can
be
found
in
the
manual
.
the
ultimate
goal
of
pollution
prevention
is
to
reduce
present
and
future
threats
to
human
health
and
the
environment
.
pollution
prevention
(
also
referred
to
as
source
reduction
)
is
the
use
of
materials
,
processes
,
or
practices
that
reduce
or
eliminate
the
quantity
and
or
toxicity
of
wastes
at
the
source
of
generation
.
pollution
prevention
is
the
first
step
in
a
hierarchy
of
options
for
reducing
the
generation
of
waste
.
the
first
recommended
pollution
prevention
option
is
to
replace
chemical
treatment
with
another
type
of
treatment
to
achieve
surface
protection
.
one
alternate
is
to
dry
the
wood
to
reduce
water
content
(
high
water
content
leads
to
sapstain
.
the
agency
is
aware
that
this
option
may
not
be
economically
viable
for
a
smaller
mill
.
if
such
a
system
cannot
be
feasibly
employed
,
it
would
be
preferable
for
a
user
of
chlorophenoliccontaining
chlorophenolic
containing
formulations
to
switch
to
an
alternate
formulation
.
other
pollution
prevention
strategies
for
use
within
the
surface
protection
industry
include
:
(
1
)
providing
local
and
general
ventilation
within
the
cutting
process
area
to
reduce
dust
that
can
accumulate
on
wood
;
(
2
)
blowing
wood
with
air
to
reduce
the
amount
of
sawdust
on
wood
prior
to
surface
protection
;
and
(
3
)
using
drainage
collection
devices
like
gutters
on
rooftops
to
keep
precipitation
away
from
process
wastes
.
the
pollution
prevention
practices
described
here
can
be
critical
to
reduce
the
amount
of
waste
generated
.
although
the
agency
is
not
listing
these
chlorophenolic
wood
surface
protection
wastes
,
the
pollution
prevention
practices
described
in
the
guidance
manual
are
applicable
to
any
waste
generating
process
.
for
wastes
that
cannot
be
reduced
at
the
source
,
generators
may
consider
recycling
as
the
next
best
option
.
