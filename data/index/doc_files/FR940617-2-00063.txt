doe
has
evaluated
,
in
accordance
with
§
600
14
of
the
federal
assistance
regulations
,
the
unsolicited
proposal
entitled
`
pv
implementation
program
'
and
recommends
that
the
unsolicited
proposal
be
accepted
for
support
without
further
competition
in
accordance
with
§

14
of
the
federal
assistance
regulations
.
doe
is
actively
pursuing
a
program
towards
solar
energy
conversion
,
with
one
major
objective
being
the
costeffective
cost
effective
application
of
photovoltaics
(
pv
)
in
utility
applications
.
this
sce
activity
directly
relates
to
the
program
objective
and
could
be
a
significant
step
toward
the
implementation
of
pv
in
utility
applications
.
the
proposal
from
sce
is
a
unique
opportunity
to
install
pv
in
a
utility
application
which
is
likely
to
be
one
of
the
closest
to
being
cost
effective
in
the
near
term
.
in
addition
,
sce
is
active
in
the
promotion
of
renewable
energy
sources
and
is
an
ideal
utility
candidate
to
pursue
the
proposed
pv
application
.
the
proposed
application
involves
using
pv
to
meet
peak
load
requirements
on
selected
sce
electric
distribution
circuits
.
the
circuits
of
interest
are
old
,
underground
4
kv
circuits
which
have
reached
the
limit
of
their
loadcarrying
load
carrying
capability
.
the
circuits
serve
residential
areas
which
have
seen
recent
growth
in
peak
load
requirements
so
that
the
circuits
will
soon
exceed
their
limit
during
the
summer
peak
load
period
.
without
pv
,
the
main
alternative
is
to
replace
the
circuits
by
excavating
city
streets
and
landscaping
to
install
new
underground
,
highcapacity
high
capacity
cable
.
installing
pv
to
meet
the
peak
load
requirements
on
these
circuits
results
in
the
deferment
of
this
significant
cable
replacement
expense
.
sce
estimated
that
replacement
of
about
200
miles
of
underground
4
kv
circuits
in
their
system
could
be
deferred
by
the
use
of
gridconnected
grid
connected
pv
.
this
would
require
approximately
25
mw
of
pv
to
meet
the
peak
loads
on
these
circuits
.
the
successful
implementation
of
this
project
would
provide
:
1

of

in

loads
by

,
with
a
sufficiently
large
number
of
potential
additional
circuits
to
allow
the
project
to
develop
into
a
major
pv
demonstration
if
warranted
.
preliminary
surveys
conducted
by
sce
indicate
that
sufficient
space
will
be
available
in
the
residential
areas
to
allow
pv
installations
.
