preparing
the
work
area
disabling
hvac
systems
:
the
power
to
the
heating
,
ventilation
,
and
air
conditioning
systems
that
service
the
restricted
area
must
be
deactivated
and
locked
off
.
all
ducts
,
grills
,
access
ports
,
windows
and
vents
must
be
sealed
off
with
two
layers
of
plastic
to
prevent
entrainment
of
contaminated
air
.
operating
hvac
systems
in
the
restricted
area
:
if
components
of
a
hvac
system
located
in
the
restricted
area
are
connected
to
a
system
that
will
service
another
zone
during
the
project
,
the
portion
of
the
duct
in
the
restricted
area
must
be
sealed
and
pressurized
.
necessary
precautions
include
caulking
the
duct
joints
,
covering
all
cracks
and
openings
with
two
layers
of
sheeting
,
and
pressurizing
the
duct
throughout
the
duration
of
the
project
by
restricting
the
return
air
flow
.
the
power
to
the
fan
supplying
the
positive
pressure
should
be
locked
`
on
'
to
prevent
pressure
loss
.
sealing
elevators
:
if
an
elevator
shaft
is
located
in
the
restricted
area
,
it
should
be
either
shut
down
or
isolated
by
sealing
with
two
layers
of
plastic
sheeting
.
the
sheeting
should
provide
enough
slack
to
accommodate
the
pressure
changes
in
the
shaft
without
breaking
the
airtight
air
tight
seal
.
removing
mobile
objects
:
all
movable
objects
should
be
cleaned
and
removed
from
the
work
area
before
an
enclosure
is
constructed
unless
moving
the
objects
creates
a
hazard
.
mobile
objects
will
be
assumed
to
be
contaminated
and
should
be
either
cleaned
with
amended
water
and
a
hepa
vacuum
and
then
removed
from
the
area
or
wrapped
and
then
disposed
of
as
hazardous
waste
.
cleaning
and
sealing
surfaces
:
after
cleaning
with
water
and
a
hepa
vacuum
,
surfaces
of
stationary
objects
should
be
covered
with
two
layers
of
plastic
sheeting
.
the
sheeting
should
be
secured
with
duct
tape
or
an
equivalent
method
to
provide
a
tight
seal
around
the
object
.
bagging
waste
:
in
addition
to
the
requirement
for
immediate
bagging
of
waste
for
disposal
,
it
is
further
recommended
that
the
waste
material
be
doublebagged
double
bagged
and
sealed
in
plastic
bags
designed
for
asbestos
disposal
.
the
bags
should
be
stored
in
a
waste
storage
area
that
can
be
controlled
by
the
workers
conducting
the
removal
.
filters
removed
from
air
handling
units
and
rubbish
removed
from
the
area
are
to
be
bagged
and
handled
as
hazardous
waste
.
constructing
the
enclosure
the
enclosure
should
be
constructed
to
provide
an
airtight
air
tight
seal
around
ducts
and
openings
into
existing
ventilation
systems
and
around
penetrations
for
electrical
conduits
,
telephone
wires
,
water
lines
,
drain
pipes
,
etc
.
enclosures
should
be
both
airtight
and
watertight
except
for
those
openings
designed
to
provide
entry
and
or
air
flow
control
.
size
:
an
enclosure
should
be
the
minimum
volume
to
encompass
all
of
the
working
surfaces
yet
allow
unencumbered
movement
by
the
workers
,
provide
unrestricted
air
flow
past
the
workers
,
and
ensure
walking
surfaces
can
be
kept
free
of
tripping
hazards
.
shape
:
the
enclosure
may
be
any
shape
that
optimizes
the
flow
of
ventilation
air
past
the
workers
.
structural
integrity
:
the
walls
,
ceilings
and
floors
must
be
supported
in
such
a
manner
that
portions
of
the
enclosure
will
not
fall
down
during
normal
use
.
openings
:
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
structure
be
airtight
;
openings
may
be
designed
to
direct
air
flow
.
such
openings
should
be
located
at
a
distance
from
active
removal
operations
.
they
should
be
designed
to
draw
air
into
the
enclosure
under
all
anticipated
circumstances
.
in
the
event
that
negative
pressure
is
lost
,
they
should
be
fitted
with
either
hepa
filters
to
trap
dust
or
automatic
trap
doors
that
prevent
dust
from
escaping
the
enclosure
.
openings
for
exits
should
be
controlled
by
an
airlock
or
a
vestibule
.
barrier
supports
:
frames
should
be
constructed
to
support
all
unsupported
spans
of
sheeting
.
sheeting
:
walls
,
barriers
,
ceilings
,
and
floors
should
be
lined
with
two
layers
of
plastic
sheeting
having
a
thickness
of
at
least
6
mil
.
