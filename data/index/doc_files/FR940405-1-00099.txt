as

in

other
reductions

oshas
estimates
are
based
upon
the

(
presented
in

)
and
oshas
quantitative
risk
assessment
discussed
in
detail
in
the
preamble
to
the

osha
preliminarily
estimates
the
risk
of
working
in
mechanically
ventilated
workplaces
to
be
57
severe
headaches
and
85
upper
respiratory
symptoms
per
1000
employees
over
a
45
year
work
lifetime
.
by
applying
these
rates
to
the
affected
population
at
risk
,
osha
estimates
that
38
million
severe
headaches
and
56
million
upper
respiratory
symptoms
will
develop
in
employees
over
the
next
45
years
who
work
in
buildings
with
mechanical
ventilation
(
with
the
worker
population
held
constant
.
a
common
theme
that
runs
through
the
literature
and
the
osha
docket
indicates
that
the
principal
factor
associated
with
indoor
air
quality
complaints
is
inadequate
ventilation
.
however
,
information
available
does
not
quantify
the
effectiveness
of
ventilation
improvements
.
nemi
reports
that
:
`
ventilation
system
modifications
and
improvements
are
key
elements
of
solving
existing
iaq
problems
and
reducing
iaq
complaints
.
in
every
case
where
recommended
ventilation
system
modifications
and
improvements
are
implemented
,
the
frequency
and
severity
of
complaints
are
reduced
significantly

[

some
of
the
submissions
base
the
effectiveness
of
ventilation
improvements
on
the
niosh
analysis
of
indoor
air
quality
investigations
[
exs
.
31183
,
31090
.
in
approximately
500
indoor
air
quality
investigations
,
niosh
found
that
the
primary
causes
of
indoor
air
quality
problems
were
inadequate
ventilation
(

,
contamination
from
outside

(

,
microbial
contamination

,
contamination

excluding
contamination
from
building
fabric
and
unknown
sources
,
this
suggests
that
83
percent
of
complaints
related
to
iaq
problems
would
be
eliminated
by
the
proposed
osha
standard
.
for
purposes
of
this
analysis
,
osha
assumes
that
the
overall
effectiveness
is
,
therefore
,
80
percent
.
as
shown
in
table
vi5
,
osha
estimates
that
the
proposed
standard
will
prevent
3
million
severe
headaches
and
45
million
upper
respiratory
symptoms
over
the
next
45
years
.
this
is
,
approximately
,
69000
severe
headaches
and
105000
upper
respiratory
symptoms
per
year
.
these
estimates
understate
the
prevalence
of
buildingrelated
building
related
symptoms
since
they
only
reflect
excess
risk
in
only
air
conditioned
buildings
.
osha
believes
that
the
standard
will
also
prevent
severe
headaches
and
upper
respiratory
symptoms
in
heated
(
but
not
air
conditioned
)
buildings
,
and
that
it
will
prevent
various
other
adverse
health
effects
.
osha
is
seeking
additional
information
upon
which
to
base
quantifiable
estimates
of
the
other
known
adverse
health
effects
.
osha
requests
comment
on
the
methodology
of
estimating
the
benefits
for
the
iaq
portion
of
the
proposal
.
specifically
,
osha
requests
any
studies
which
document
(
in
quantitative
terms
)
the
effectiveness
of
hvac
maintenance
on
the
decline
of
