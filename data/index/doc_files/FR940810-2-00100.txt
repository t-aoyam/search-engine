requests
from
licensee
centerior
energy
(
centerior
)
dated
06/02/1994
and
06/06/1994
,
the
staff
hereby
notices
the
request
by
centerior
to
amend
the
perry
nuclear
power
plant
(
perry
)
and
davisbesse
davis
besse
nuclear
power
station
(
davisbesse
davis
besse
)
operating
licenses
to
reflect
a
new
owneroperator
owner
operator
of
perry
and
davisbesse
davis
besse
.
the
new
owneroperator
owner
operator
,
temporarily
named
(
newco
'
by
centerior
,
will
result
from
the
proposed
merger
between
the
toledo
edison
company
(
te
)
and
the
cleveland
electric
illuminating
company
(
ceiboth
existing
licensees
and
owners
of
the
perry
and
davisbesse
davis
besse
facilities
.
the
staff
has
interpreted
the
atomic
energy
act
of
1954
,
as
amended
,
and
the
commissions
regulations
,
to
require
an
antitrust
review
of
an
owner
or
operator
prior
to
the
proposed
new
owner
taking
possession
of
the
facility
or
prior
to
the
proposed
new
operator
assuming
responsibility
for
operating
the
facility
in
question
.
where
the
new
operator
is
a
nonowner
owner
,
the
staff
has
developed
,
with
the
commissions
approval
,
an
antitrust
license
condition
that
prohibits
the
new
operator
from
marketing
or
brokering
power
or
energy
from
the
facility
.
(
this
type
of
license
condition
would
not
apply
in
the
instant
case
because
newco
will
be
both
an
owner
and
an
operator
of
perry
and
davisbesse
davis
besse
)
the
intent
of
the
staff
in
developing
the
nonowner
owner
operator
license
condition
is
to
forgo
the
need
for
an
extended
review
of
the
operators
competitive
practices
and
any
accompanying
analysis
of
how
any
practices
impact
or
could
impact
the
electric
bulk
power
services
market
.
by
agreeing
not
to
be
involved
in
the
facilitys
marketing
or
brokering
of
bulk
power
services
,
the
staff
believes
the
new
nonowner
owner
operator
will
not
possess
enough
market
power
to
significantly
impact
the
market
.
the
instant
amendment
requests
involve
two
licensees
,
te
and
cei
,
that
have
undergone
antitrust
reviews
by
the
staff
at
the
construction
permit
and
operating
license
stages
of
the
licensing
process
.
the
construction
permit
antitrust
review
in
the
combined
perry/davisbesse
perry/davis
besse
proceeding
resulted
in
extensive
antitrust
license
conditions
obligating
te
and
cei
to
cease
certain
anticompetitive
practices
and
make
available
certain
bulk
power
services
to
power
entities
in
the
affected
bulk
power
services
market
.
this
review
analyzed
the
practices
of
the
power
pooling
group
known
as
capco
,
ie
,
central
area
power
coordination
group
,
as
a
whole
and
also
the
practices
of
the
five
individual
utility
operating
companies
,
including
te
and
cei
,
that
made
up
capco
.
the
staff
believes
the
construction
permit
antitrust
review
and
the
operating
license
review
,
which
found
no
significant
antitrust
changes
since
the
previous
review
,
adequately
defined
the
problems
associated
with
tes
and
ceis
competitive
practices
and
addressed
these
problems
during
the
review
process
.
the
license
conditions
that
evolved
from
the
commissions
antitrust
review
process
are
extensive
and
procompetitive
.
the
licensee
has
agreed
that
the
new
owneroperator
owner
operator
will
be
bound
by
the
existing
antitrust
license
conditions
now
binding
te
and
ceiby
doing
so
,
the
staff
believes
that
there
is
no
need
to
conduct
another
antitrust
review
as
a
result
of
the
proposed
merger
nor
is
there
any
need
to
seek
public
comment
on
the
proposed
merger
.
