in
addition
,
the
section
would
allow
for
sending
of
the
notice
for

by

or
by
other

the
current
regulation
provides
that

no
less
than
15
calendar
days
before
the

however
,

as
possible
to
assure
that
payment
can
be
timely
made

under

proposed
section
,

to
be

no
more

60

procedural
requirements
it
has
been
determined
that
this
proposed
rule
is
not
a
significant
regulatory
action
as
defined
in
executive
order
12866
.
therefore
,
an
assessment
of
anticipated
benefits
,
costs
and
regulatory
alternatives
is
not
required
.
although
this
rule
is
being
issued
in
proposed
form
to
secure
the
benefit
of
public
comment
,
the
rule
relates
to
matters
of
public
contract
,
as
well
as
the
borrowing
power
and
fiscal
authority
of
the
united
states
.
the
notice
and
public
procedures
requirements
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
are
inapplicable
,
pursuant
to
5
usc
.
553a2
.
as
no
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
is
required
,
the
provisions
of
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
(
5
usc
.
601
,
et
seq
)
do
not
apply
.
the
collections
of

contained
in

have
been
previously
reviewed
and
approved
by
the
office
of

and
budget
,

the
requirements
of
the
paperwork
reduction
act
(
44

3507
)
under
control
number
15350091
.
the
principal
purpose
of
the
proposed
rule
is
to
change
the
address
of
the
receiving
entity
.
the
revision
would
not
impose
a
