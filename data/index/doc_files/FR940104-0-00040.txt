nmfs
agrees
with
the
world
wildlife
fund
that
development
and
implementation
of
a
recovery
plan
is
essential
for
the
conservation
and
recovery
of
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
for
this
reason
,
nmfs
has
appointed
a
national
sacramento
river
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
recovery
team
,
comprised
of
fishery
resource
mangers
,
experts
on
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
biology
,
and
conservation
biology
specialists
,
to
develop
a
recovery
plan
.
the
recovery
team
has
been
meeting
since
09/19/1992
and
will
submit
a
draft
recovery
plan
to
nmfs
in
1994
.
interiors
technical
comments
were
incorporated
where
appropriate
.
nmfs
disagrees
with
the
comments
of
the
westlands
water
district
,
the
family
water
alliance
,
and
the
glenn
county
board
of
supervisors
that
current
protective
measures
should
be
allowed
to
be
in
place
for
a
certain
amount
of
time
and
their
effectiveness
evaluated
before
nmfs
determines
whether
reclassification
is
necessary
.
although
measures
have
been
implemented
to
reduce
adverse
impacts
on
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
,
and
nmfs
believes
they
are
likely
to
be
effective
,
their
effectiveness
is
currently
unknown
and
cannot
be
evaluated
until
data
on
future
returns
are
available
.
one
of
the
factors
to
be
considered
in
listing
,
delisting
and
reclassifying
a
species
is
`
the
inadequacy
of
existing
regulatory
mechanisms
'
judicial
interpretation
of
this
language
allows
nmfs
to
also
consider
the
`
adequacy
'
of
regulatory
mechanisms
in
its
listing
decisions
.
it
is
premature
to
determine
the
adequacy
of
these
measures
for
purposes
of
this
reclassification
.
most
measures
will
not
demonstrate
positive
results
until
the
1996
return
of
adult
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
nmfs
must
determine
whether
reclassification
is
justified
on
the
basis
of
the
current
status
of
the
population
and
the
factors
affecting
its
continued
existence
.
summary
of
factors
affecting
the
species

of
the

specifies
five
criteria
to
be
evaluated
in
reviewing
the
status
of
a
species
or
population
proposed
for
listing
or
reclassification
.
the
following
discussion
is
in
addition
to
the
evaluation
of
these
factors
in
the

nmfs
issued
a
biological
opinion
and
incidental
take
statement
to
the
bureau
of
reclamation
which
concluded
that
longterm
long
term
operations
of
the
federal
central
valley
project
and
the
state
water
project
would
jeopardize
the
continued
existence
of

.
the
opinion
identifies
a
reasonable
and
prudent
alternative
with
measures
designed
to
protect
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
from
the
longterm
long
term
operations
of
shasta
and
keswick
dams
,
as
well
as
other
facilities
of
the
central

project
.
implementation
of
these

is
expected
to
substantially
improve

and

conditions
in

for

.
the
specific
measures
contained
in
the
reasonable
and
prudent
alternative
that
relate
to
shasta

keswick
dams
require
the
bureau
to
(

use
a
more

approach

determine

annual
allocation
of
