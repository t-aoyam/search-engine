incorporating
the
sunscreen
transmission
spectrum
into
the
convolution
spectrum
to
obtain
a
uva
effectiveness
ratio
which
is
conveniently
expressed
as
a
uva
protection
percentage
(
app
.
the
comment
maintained
that
,
unlike
other
methods
,
the
app
represents
the
fraction
of
full
spectrum
uva
(
320
to
400
nm
)
removed
by
a
product
.
the
comment
stated
that
because
the
original
`
full
spectrum
'
method
produces
an
spf
value
analogous
to
the
clinically
determined
spf
number
,
the
app
has
direct
relevance
to
the
spf
determined
on
human
subjects
and
is
a
subset
of
the
fullspectrum
full
spectrum
spf
determination
.
the
comment
added
that
once
an
spf
has
been
determined
clinically
,
it
is
simple
to
take
the
fullspectrum
full
spectrum
absorbance
spectrum
and
calculate
the
app
based
on
the
clinical
test
results
.
therefore
,
although
the
determination
of
the
app
does
involve
in
vitro
measurements
,
it
also
relies
on
direct
clinical
measurements
.
the
comment
contended
that
there
are
a
number
of
advantages
to
using
the
app
system
:
(
1
)
it
is
a
subset
of
the
existing
spf
for
sunscreen
drug
products
and
,
therefore
,
relates
to
an
erythemal
endpoint
in
normal
skin
;
(

)
it
does
not
unnecessarily
duplicate
clinical
testing
;
(
3
)
it
clearly
demonstrates
whether
a
sunscreen
drug
product
provides
meaningful
protection
against
uva
radiation
,
and
it
is
useful
in
determining
comparative
uva
protection
;
(
4
)
it
avoids
the
deficiencies
of
nonsolar
light
sources
,
photosensitizing
chemicals
,
the
failure
of
dose
reciprocity
for
human
uva
exposures
,
and
endpoints
which
do
not
relate
to
known
uva
damage
to
human
skin
;
(
5
)
it
is
independent
of
exposure
dose
or
duration
;
(
6
)
it
includes
all
the
uva
wavelengths
in
their
direct
proportion
and
intensity
as
found
in
natural
sunlight
;
and
(
7
)
it
is
directly
relevant
to
overall
product
effectiveness
.
the
comment
added
that
in
the
absence
of
a
light
source
specific
to
the
uva
range
,
app
determination
is
the
best
measurement
of
a
products
uva
protection
level
.
one
comment
stated
that
the
in
vitro
app
test
is
difficult
to
extend
to
a
human
in
vivo
situation
and
that
the
test
cannot
be
used
to
study
substantivity
or
stability
.
the
comment
added
that
because
the
app
test
uses
the
erythema
action
spectrum
and
a
mathematical
extraction
of
the
uva
segment
of
the
solar
spectrum
,
it
overestimates
the
actual
amount
of
uva
radiation
blocked
by
most
products
.
a
reply
comment
argued
that
the
app
technique
is
derived
from
wellstudied
well
studied
and
extensively
published
in
vitro
spf
methodology
(
refs
.
9
,
10
,
and
11
,
that
it
is
simple
to
evaluate
water
resistance
using
this
model
,
and
that
data
on
water
resistance
have
been
published
.
the
reply
comment
added
that
app
values
are
derived
from
the
same
spectral
data
(
320
to
400
nm
)
that
provide
in
vitro
spf
values
.
the
final
spf
value
from
clinical
studies
is
compared
to
the
in
vitro
spf
and
the
absorbance
spectrum
can
be
matched
to
the
exact
clinical
spf
for
uva
calculations
.
the
uva
portion
of
the
sunscreens
efficacy
can
then
be
calculated
from
the
in
vitro
spf
data
.
therefore
,
the
comment
argued
that
the
app
has
direct
relevance
to
the
clinical
effectiveness
of
the
sunscreen
product
,
but
does
not
require
the
exposure
of
human
subjects
to
unnecessary
uv
radiation
.
one
comment
stated
that
an
in
vitro
method
developed
by
diffey
and
robson
(
ref
.
12
)
avoids
many
of
the
limitations
of
in
vivo
methods
(
eg
,
lack
of
reciprocity
and
light
sources
that
produce
5
to
20
times
the
intensity
of
the
sun
)
and
allows
the
correct
estimation
of
the
attenuating
power
of
a
sunscreen
drug
product
.
the
comment
described
this
method
as
recording
photocurrent
in
5
nm
steps
from
290
to
400
nm
and
measuring
the
spectral
transmission
of
uv
radiation
through
a
sample
of
transpore
tm
tape
with
and
without
sunscreen
applied
.
transpore
tm
tape
is
uv
radiation
transparent
and
has
a
rough
surface
that
distributes
sunscreen
products
in
a
way
similar
to
the
uneven
surface
of
the
skin
.
any
radiation
source
may
be
used
,
providing
there
is
a
continuous
power
distribution
between
290
and
400
nm
.
this
method
assesses
the
spf
of
a
product
and
the
uva
uvb
ratio
.
the
uva
uvb
ratio
compares
the
reduction
of
uv
radiation
in
the
uva
region
with
that
in
the
uvb
region
of
the
spectrum
.
according
to
the
comment
,
this
ratio
can
be
used
as
an
indicator
of
the
uva
protection
properties
of
a
sunscreen
drug
product
.
one
comment
claimed
that
the
method
developed
by
diffey
and
robson
(
ref
.
12
)
has
many
advantages
,
as
well
as
being
simple
,
inexpensive
,
and
well
correlated
with
clinical
testing
.
the
comment
noted
that
the
method
does
not
require
a
biological
endpoint
such
as
erythema
,
tanning
,
or
immediate
pigment
darkening
.
the
comment
stated
that
the
method
provides
a
basis
for
the
classification
of
the
uva
protection
provided
by
a
product
and
added
that
a
manufacturer
planned
to
utilize
the
diffey
and
robson
method
to
standardize
the
uva
claims
of
its
products
.
sunscreen
products
would
be
labeled
with
one
to
four
stars
depending
upon
the
amount
of
uva
protection
provided
by
the
products
as
determined
by
the
diffey
and
robson
method
.
the
comment
concluded
that
using
the
`
star
'
rating
system
for
uva
claims
and
the
spf
designation
for
uvb
claims
provides
a
simple
method
for
consumers
to
determine
the
protective
nature
of
a
sunscreen
product
.

describing
the

the
comment
noted
that
the
accuracy
of
this
method
is
enhanced
by
good
product
application
and
that
the
in

results
obtained
by
this
method
show
good
