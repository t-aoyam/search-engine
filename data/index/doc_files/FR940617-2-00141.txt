authorizes
the
secretary
to
insure
mortgages
that
refinance
existing
mortgages
insured
under
section
235
.
the
purpose
of
the
program
is
to
reduce
the
interest
rate
insured
and
assisted
under
section
235
in
order
that
the
assistance
payments
the
department
pays
on
behalf
of
mortgagors
may
be
reduced
.
the
regulations
implementing
the
program
are
contained
in
subpart

the
interest
rate
for

set
by
the
secretary
and
published
in
the
federal
register
as
authorized
by

.
the
previous
section

interest
rate
of
8
percent
was
published
in
the
federal
register
on
04/21/1994
(

the
department
has
determined
that
market
conditions
dictate
a
change
in
the

interest
rate
.
the
change
will
take
effect
on
the
date
of
publication
of
this
notice
.
the
most
recent
hud
survey
of
mortgage
market
conditions
(
ie
,
secondary
market
prices
and
yields

an

found
that
the

fha
rate
being
quoted
to

commitments
of

more
was
8
50
percent
on
04/01/1994
,
with
an
average
of
.
32
points
,
and
an
effective
interest
rate
of
8
55
percent
.
the
8
50
percent
rate
was
dominant
in
most
parts
of
the
country
.
most
fha
mortgages
are
funded
in
the
gnma
mortgagebacked
mortgage
backed
securities
market
.
there
is
a
50
basis
point
spread
between
fha
contract
interest
rates
and
gnma
coupon
rates
(
this
covers
the
gnma
guarantee
fee
and
servicing
cost
.
on
05/12/1994
,
the
gnma
7
50
percent
coupon
securities
(
8
percent
fha
loans
)
were
priced
at
about
5
points
discount
.
this
level
of
discount
tends
to
impede
fha
loans
to
finance
home
purchases
.
on
the
other
hand
,
the
gnma
8
percent
security
(
8
50
percent
fha
loans
)
was
trading
in
the
twomonth
two
month
forward
market
at
around
two
points
discount
,
while
the
8
50
percent
gnma
coupons
(
9
percent
fha
mortgages
)
continued
to
trade
at
over
par
(
ie
,
premium
.
under
the
fha
negotiated
rate
points
provisions
a
two
point
discount
for
8
50
percent
fha
mortgages
would
not
be
burdensome
.
it
is
expected
that
secondary
market
prices
will
stabilize
in
the
near
term
at
the
8
50
percent
contract
rate
.
the
05/01/1994
,
blue
chip
financial
forecast
showed
that
after
mortgage
rates
rose
in
the
first
quarter
of
1994
,
the
average
forecast
was
that
mortgage
rates
would
stabilize
in
the
second
,
third
and
fourth
quarters
.
the
may
summary
forecast
of
data
resources
incorporated
projects
a
rise
in
30
year
treasury
rates
during
the
second
quarter
(
which
is
half
over
,
then
stable
rates
in
the
third
and
fourth
quarters
.
adjusting
the
section
235r
)
rate
to
8
50
percent
will
bring
this
rate
back
into
line
with
the
rest
of
the
fha
current
production
loans
.
therefore
,
the
maximum
rate
for

is
8
50
percent
