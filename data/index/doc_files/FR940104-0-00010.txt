in
a
related
matter
,
based
upon
the
courts
advice
,
the
commission
stated
that
it
will
not
retroactively
apply
the
contemporaneous
disclosure
requirement
of

to

applicability
to

,
the
commission
found
that
despite
the
fact
that
there
is
a
unanimous
approval
provision
in
the

partnership
agreement
,
the
two
partners
that
have
parent
companies

can
still
exercise

as
defined

regulations
.

the
commission
found
that
even
with
a
unanimous
approval
provision
in
the
partnership
agreement
,
ozark
pipeline
company
and
tennessee
ozark
gas
company
,
the
two
partners
whose
parent
companies
have
marketing
affiliates
,
can
each
act
alone
to
direct
or
effect
the
management
or
policies
of
ozark
gas
transmission
system
.
the
commission
stated
that
since
there
is
a
unanimous
approval
requirement
,
each
partner
has
veto
power
over
any
decision
by
simply
withholding
its
vote
.
the
commission
stated
that
such
power
could
be
exercised
in
a
manner
that
could
unduly
prefer
the
marketing
affiliates
related
to
ozarks
partners
,
for
example
,
by
either
or
both
partners
refusing
to
engage
in
an
action
that
would
benefit
an
independent
marketer
in
competition
with
one
of
ozarks
partners
'
affiliates
.
the
commission
stated
that
it
believed
that
control
can
be
exercised
in
a
negative
manner
,
ie
,
by
withholding
approval
of
a
specific
policy
or
transaction
,
as
well
as
in
an
affirmative
manner
,
ie
,
by
actually
approving
a
decision
that
would
unduly
prefer
a
marketing
affiliate
.

finally
,
the

extended
the

date

reporting

of
the
important

they

the

that
although

636
does
not
change
the
requirements
governing
the
relationship
between
pipelines
and
their
marketing
affiliates
,
the
structural
changes
engendered
by
full
compliance
with
the
rule
would
remove
the
need
to
continue

and
the

assert
that
the

should
eliminate
from

the
requirement
that
sales
and
marketing
information
given
to
a
marketing
affiliate
must
be
contemporaneously
disclosed
to
all
potential
shippers
because
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
courts
decision
in
tenneco
.
the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
contend
that
the
revised
standard
provides
a
limited
exclusion
for
sales
and
marketing
information
that
is
available
from
public
sources
or
is
related
to

off

transactions

as
to
how
so
limited
an
exclusion
can
be
interpreted
as
responsive
to
the
courts
remand
.
the
pipelines
and
joint
parties
argue
that
the
commissions
assumption
that
pipelines
obtain
sales
and
marketing
information
in
connection
with
or
when
combined
with
transportation
is
not
responsive
to
the
courts
directive
to
provide
an
independent
justification
for
barring
the
exchange
of
sales
or
marketing
information
that
is
wholly
unrelated
to
transportation
information
.
the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
submit
that
order
no

497d
evidences
neither
the
independent
justification
required
by
the
court
,
nor
a
consideration
of
the
action
on
remand
which
was
suggested
by
the
court
.
the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
assert
that
the
commission
has
not
examined
the
relevant
data
and
articulated
a
satisfactory
explanation
for
its
action
including
a
rational
connection
between
the
facts
found
and
the
choice
made
.
they
argue
that
the
result
is
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
order
which
is
unsupported
by
substantial
evidence
