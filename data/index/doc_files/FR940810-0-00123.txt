although
there
was
substantial
support
for
a
comprehensive
inspection
requirement
,
osha
believes
that
the
regulatory
approach
in
these
final
standards
will
achieve
equivalent
or
superior
protection
to
exposed
workers
at
much
reduced
cost
.
the
reasons
are
as
follows
.
a
comprehensive
walltowall
wall
to
wall
inspection
requirement
is
found
to
be
unnecessary
to
protect
employees
against
risks
of
exposure
from
asbestoscontaining
asbestos

material

which
they
are

.
such
an
inspection
requirement
would
be
very
costly
,
may
be
overly
broad
,
the
results
may
not
be
correct
or
timely
,
would
not
necessarily
focus
on
potential
sources
of
asbestos
exposure
which
present
significant
risks
to
employees
,
and
its
great
expense
may
divert
resources
from
active
protection
of
workers
who
actually
disturb
asbestos
.
first
,
osha
does
not
believe
that
protecting
employees
in
buildings
from
significant
asbestos
exposure
requires
that
all
suspect
materials
in
buildings
first
be
identified
.
although
all
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
materials
may
release
fibers
when
their
matrices
are
disturbed
,
certain
materials
are
known
to
be
more
easily
damaged
or
to
suffer
more
deterioration
,
and
thus
cause
higher
airborne
fiber
levels
than
others
.
as
discussed
in
the
11/19/1992
notice
,
osha
determined
that
thermal
system
insulation
(
tsi
)
and
sprayed

and
troweled
on
surfacing
materials
are
such
materials
.
they
are
potentially
more
friable
,
are
much
more
prevalent
,
are
more
accessible
and
are
the
subject
of
more
maintenance
and
repair
activities
than
are
other
asbestos
containing
materials
.
they
are
widely
prevalent
.
a
1984
epa
study
limited
to
residential
,
commercial
and
public
buildings
nationally
,
found
about
three
quarters
of
such

.
the
materials
are
usually
accessible
.
surfacing
material
was
applied
for
decorative
and
acoustical
purposes
early
on
,
and
was
later
applied
as
insulation
coating
to
protect
structural

during
fires
.
the
hei
report
in
summarizing
studies
conducted
in
new

,
california
,
and
philadelphia
stated
that
`
important
findings
from
these
studies
include
the
frequent
use
of
friable
surfacing
in
multistoried
storied
buildings
and
the
high
proportion
of
damage
to

48
to

.
the
accessibility
of
thermal
system
insulation
is
not
limited
to
employees
who
directly
disturb
it
to
repair
or
replace
the
piping
and
infrastructure
it
covers
.
as
noted
by
a
participant
:
in
industrial
settings
there
are
many
sources
of
fiber
release
including
vibration
(
people

the
data
submitted
to
osha
indicate
that
these
two
materials
have
high
exposure
potential
.
for
example
,
the
potential
of

material
to
become
friable
and
result
in
sizable
exposures
was
shown
by
the
yale

involved

that

data
showing
high
exposure
levels
from
tsi
are
ample
and
are
discussed
in
detail
in
the
preamble
discussion
on
methods
of
compliance
.
the
data
in
this
record
showing
exposures
to
other
kinds
of
asbestos
containing
material
such
as
gaskets
,
wallboard
,
roofing
and
siding
materials
show
that
generally
,
exposures
to
these
products
under
comparable
controls
are
lower
than
those
released
by
the
materials
designated
by
osha
as
`
high
hazard
'
and
for
which
the
presumption
applies
.
the
`
highhazard
high
hazard
'
materials
are
much
more
prevalent
in
buildings
and
facilities
,
disturbances
of
them
are
more
common
.
therefore
osha
believes
that
a
targeted
approach
to
presuming
the
presence
of
high
hazard
previously
installed
asbestos
containing
materials
in
buildings
which
are
likely
to
contain
them
will
provide
equivalent
protection
to
potentially
exposed
employees
than
a
requirement
to
inspect
all
buildings
and
facilities
for
all
asbestos
containing
materials
.
some
building
owners
will
continue
to
conduct
comprehensive
surveys
,
others
,
when
cost
is
an
issue
,
will
rely
on
presumptions
to
protect
employees
from
potential
exposure
