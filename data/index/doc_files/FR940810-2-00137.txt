no

are

in

since

concern
that

.
several
factors
assure
photometric
compliance
with
standard
108
for
the
mercedesbenz
mercedes
benz
unbonded
headlamp
.
first
,
in
the
headlamp
manufacturing
process
,
the
headlamp
is
designed
so
that
the
lens
can
be
clipped
onto
any
housing
reflector
assembly
and
be
assured
of
meeting
the
photometric
performance
requirements
of
standard
108

permits
only
a
positive
and
secure
attachment
.
there
are
no
shims
or
adjustments
that
could
influence
the
lens
mounting
.
second
,
from
a
design
point
of
view
,
the
physical
size
of
the
reflector
and
lens
make
the
headlamp
highly
insensitive
to
minute
positioning
variations
in
mounting
and
or
manufacture
.

.
vehicle
maintenance
all
affected
vehicles
are
within
the
time
constraints
of
the
warranty
period
.
thus
,
within
the
next
12
months
,
[
mercedes
]
will
be
able
to
remedy
the
noncompliance
when
the
subject
vehicles
are
brought
in
for
service
.
[
mercedes
]
will
direct
dealers
to
bond
the
headlamps
of
all
noncomplying
vehicles
brought
to
authorized
dealers
for
service
.

.
conclusion
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
headlamps
comply
with
all
performance
aspects
of
standard
108
,
that
the
replacement
lenses
are
no
longer
available
from
[
mercedes
]
or
its
dealers
,
and
that
the
vehicles
will
be
remedied
shortly
through
routine
warranty
maintenance
,
there
is
no
adverse
impact
on
safety
.
therefore
,
[
mercedes
believes
that
]
nhtsa
should
grant
[
its
]
petition
for
an
exemption
for
an
inconsequential
noncompliance
with
standard
108
.
one
comment
was
received
,
from
volkswagen
of
north
america
,
inc
,
which
supported
granting
the
petition
.
nhtsas
principal
concerns
with
headlamp
compliance
are
photometric
performance
and
durability
.
the
agency
accepts
the
petitioners
representation
that
the
accuracy
of
headlamp
aim
is
not
affected
by
lens
replacement
.
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
has
undertaken
to
bond
the
lenses
on
vehicles
that
come
in
for
warranty
service
addresses
the
agencys
concern
on
durability
.
nhtsa
deems
it
unlikely
that
,
during
the
warranty
period
which
is
early
in
the
life
of
the
headlamp
,
the
reflector
assembly
will
deteriorate
to
a
point
that
it
affects
photometric
performance
because
the
lens
is
clipped
rather
than
bonded
.
although
100
%
of
the
noncompliant
vehicles
may
not
be
returned
for
warranty
work
,
it
is
the
practice
of
most
vehicle
owners
to
have
such
work
done
by
a
factory
authorized
dealer
,
and
nhtsa
deems
it
likely
that
most
cars
will
have
the
noncompliance
corrected
by
the
end
of
the
4year
year
warranty
period
.
the
agency
is
currently
considering
a
petition
from
robert
bosch
gmbh
,
the
manufacturer
of
the
noncompliant
headlamps
,
to
permit
the
use
of
unbonded
lenses
on
replaceable
bulb
headlamps
that
are
equipped
with
onvehicle
on
vehicle
aiming
devices
.
if
nhtsa
were
to
grant
the
petition
and
to
propose
such
an
amendment
,
it
might
be
necessary
to
include
enhanced
durability
requirements
that
would
help
to
ensure
reflector
integrity
and
resistance
to
contaminants
between
the
time
the
lens
is
damaged
and
the
time
it
is
replaced
.
at
this
point
,
the
agency
does
not
know
how
the
unbonded
mercedes
headlamps
would
perform
under
such
enhanced
requirements
that
are
yet
to
be
fully
developed
and
evaluated
.
therefore
,
the
bonding
by
mercedes
of
its
vehicle
headlamps
seems
to
be
a
prudent
course
of
action
under
the
circumstances
.
the
petition
also
covered
replacement
headlamps
and
replacement
lenses
.
nhtsa
understands
that
these
parts
are
intended
to
replace
parts
on
the
headlamps
covered
by
the
petition
,
and
deems
it
likely
that
most
of
the
vehicles
equipped
with
the
replacement
headlamps
or
lenses
will
be
inspected
and
corrected
during
the
warranty
period
as
well
.
in
consideration
of
the
foregoing
,
it
is
hereby
found
that
mercedesbenz
mercedes
benz
of
north
america
,
inc
,
has
met
its
burden
of
persuasion
that
the
noncompliance
herein
described
is
inconsequential
as
it
relates
to
motor
vehicle
safety
and
its
petition
is
granted
.
