several
committee
members
believed
that
in
certain
instances
the
use
of
conventional
air
guns
should
be
allowed
.
for
example
,
if
a
source
is
using
lowvoc
low
voc
coatings
(
less
than
1
lb
voc
lb
solids
)
or
a
control
device
,
transfer
efficiency
is
not
as
critical
.
also
,
some
committee
members
pointed
out
that
limited
use
of
air
guns
for
specialty
operations
would
have
minimal
environmental
impact
as
long
as
more
efficient
application
methods
were
used
for
the
majority
of
finishing
.
the
committee
believed
that
these
were
valid
claims
and
therefore
proposes
that
conventional
air
spray
guns
only
be
used
to
apply
finishing
materials
under
the
following
circumstances
:
1
.
to
apply
finishing
materials
that
have
a
voc
content
no
greater
than
1
kg
voc
kg
solids
(
1
lb
voc
lb
solids
,
as
applied
;
2
.
for
touchup
and
repair
under
the
following
conditions
;
(
a
)
the
touchup
and
repair
occurs
after
completion
of
the
finishing
operation
;
or
(
b
)
the
touchup
and
repair
occurs
after
the
application
of
stain
and
before
the
application
of
any
other
type
of
finishing
material
,
and
the
materials
used
for
touchup
and
repair
are
applied
from
a
container
that
has
a
volume
of
no
more
than
2
gallons
.
3
.
if
spray
is
automated
,
that
is
,
the
spray
gun
is
aimed
and
triggered
automatically
,
not
manually
;
4
.
if
emissions
from
the
finishing
application
station
are
directed
to
a
control
device
;
5
.
the
conventional
air
gun
is
used
to
apply
finishing
materials
and
the
cumulative
total
of
that
finishing
material
is
less
than
5
percent
of
the
total
gallons
of
finishing
material
applied
during
that
semiannual
period
;
or
6
.
the
conventional
air
gun
is
used
to
apply
stain
on
a
part
for
which
it
is
technically
or
economically
infeasible
to
use
any
other
spray
application
technology
.
the
proposed
rule
provides
guidance
on
factors
to
be
considered
in
making
the
determination
of
technical
or
economic
infeasibility
required
for
(
6
.
these
factors
include
:
(
1
)
the
production
speed
is
too
high
or
the
part
shape
is
too
complex
for
one
operator
to
coat
the
part
and
the
application
station
is
not
large
enough
to
accommodate
an
additional
operator
;
or
(
2
)
the
excessively
large
vertical
spray
area
of
the
part
makes
it
difficult
to
avoid
sagging
or
runs
in
the
stain
.
to
demonstrate
technical
or
economic
infeasibility
,
the
facility
must
submit
a
videotape
,
technical
report
,
or
other
documentation
supporting
the
claim
of
economic
or
technical
infeasibility
.
the
agency
specifically
solicits
comments
on
this
approach
including
:
(
1
)
does
the
proposed
rule
provide
sufficient
guidance
for
the
permitting
agency
to
make
a
determination
of
economic
or
technical
infeasibility
;
and
(

)
are
the
options
for
documenting
the
claim
of
economic
or
technical
infeasibility
reasonable
and
sufficient
?
iv

selection
of
finishing
materials
.
as
previously
stated
,
several
committee
members
were
concerned
that
the
emission
limits
proposed
for
the
finishing
operations
did
not
prohibit
the
use
of
those
vhap
of
potential
concern
.
these
are
vhap
that
have
been
classified
as
high
concern
,
unrankable
,
and
nonthreshold
under
the
proposed
rulemaking
pursuant
to
section
112g
.
the
emission
limit
for
finishing
materials
allows
sources
to
continue
using
these
materials
as
long
as
the
overall
hap
limit
does
not
exceed
1
kg
vhap
kg
solids
(
1
lb
vhap
lb
solids
,
as
applied
(
existing
sources
)
or
08
kg
vhap
kg
solids
(
08
lb
vhap
lb
solids
,
as
applied
(
new
sources
.
the
committee
discussed
prohibiting
the
use
of
certain
hap
,
but
ultimately
they
agreed
that
to
determine
which
hap
were
necessary
for
which
finishing
materials
would
be
difficult
because
it
would
depend
on
the
specific
application
and
or
product
.
the
committee
also
discussed
capping
the
emissions
of
certain
hap
.
industry
argued
that
a
cap
could
limit
their
production
by
limiting
their
use
of
some
finishing
materials
.
