medicare
coverage
of
diagnostic
nocturnal
penile
tumescence
testing
(
testing
for
impotence
)
impotence
is
the
inability
to
attain
and
maintain
an
erection
sufficient
to
permit
satisfactory
intercourse
and
is
considered
by
medicare
to
be
the
failure
of
a
body
part
when
the
diagnosis
,
and
frequently
the
treatment
,
require
medical
expertise
.
impotence
can
be
organic
or
psychogenic
in
origin
.
the
focus
of
diagnostic
tests
is
to
determine
the
origin
of
impotence
to
establish
the
appropriate
treatment
.
currently
,
medicare
covers
diagnostic
npt
testing
by
plethysmography
(
for
example
,
mercury
strain
gauges
)
and
other
monitoring
devices
in
a
sleep
disorder
clinic
to
determine
whether
erectile
impotence
is
organic
or
psychogenic
.
although
impotence
is
not
a
sleep
disorder
,
the
nature
of
the
testing
requires
that
it
be
performed
while
the
patient
sleeps
.
in
the
past
,
it
was
believed
that
patients
with
predominantly
psychogenic
impotence
would
regularly
attain
normal
erections
during
rapideyemovement
rapid
eye
movement
(
rem
)
sleep
,
while
patients
with
organic
impotence
would
not
demonstrate
significant
sleepassociated
sleep
associated
normal
erections
.
during
npt
testing
,
mercury
strain
gauges
placed
on
the
shaft
of
the
penis
can
detect
and
measure
changes
in
penile
circumference
during
sleep
.
a
normal
result
of
npt
,
measured
with
strain
gauges
,
is
two
or
more
periods
of
sustained
erections
lasting
more
than
20
minutes
and
associated
with
at
least
a
25mm
increase
in
penile
circumference
.
normal
npt
in
a
person
with
sexual
dysfunction
implies
intact
neurovascular
structures
and
suggests
psychogenic
impotence
.
an
abnormal
recording
,
however
,
is
not
definitive
and
only
suggests
organic
impotence
and
will
require
further
testing
for
a
more
definite
diagnosis
.
in
addition
,
npt
testing
has
a
high
incidence
(
15
to
20
percent
)
of
falsepositive
false
positive
and
,
although
not
as
common
,
falsenegative
false
negative
findings
.
currently
,
diagnostic
npt
testing
in
a
sleep
disorder
clinic
is

as

however
,
we

revising

to
state
that
plethysmography
is
noncovered

the

it

the
