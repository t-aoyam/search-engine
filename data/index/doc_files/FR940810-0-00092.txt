although

supporting

view
that

should
not

to
the

,
the

the

showed
that
by

the

were
not
lower
at

,
approximately
the

amount
of
asbestos
was
removed
as
in

other
operations
and
the
authors
stated
that
the

was
in

good
condition
throughout

further
credence
to
the
hypothesis
that

led

of

levels
.
the
report
concluded
with
a
list
of
recommendations
for
work
practices
for
glove
bag
use
.
osha
believes
that
the
niosh
study
should
be
viewed
as
a
demonstration
of
poor
work
practices
by
untrained
employees
.
the
agency
notes
that
although
the
niosh
study
contains
carefully
presented
and
analyzed
exposure
data
,
the
study
design
was
compromised
by
the
intervention
of
the
investigators
in
instructing
the
workers
.
further
,
since
the
workers
were
untrained
,
and
for
the
most
part
did
not
use
the
glove
bags
correctly
to
attempt
to
isolate
the
disturbances
,
the
study
is
of
limited
utility
in
identifying
problems
of
glove
bag
systems
when
they
are
used
correctly
.
niosh
speculated
that
ignorance
of
proper
glove
bag
procedures
was
common
for
plant
maintenance
personnel
,
asbestos
operations
and
maintenance
personnel
,
and
many
asbestos
removal
contractors
who
use
glove
bags
only
occasionally

.
if
indeed
this
is
so
,
it
suggests
that
short
of
prohibiting
glovebag
glove
bag
removals
entirely
,
restricting
permitted
usage
to
,
for
example
,
maintenance
work
(
smallscale
small
scale
,
shortduration
short
duration
work
)
may
result
in
limiting
permitted
glove
bag
work
to
where
it
is
likely
to
be
performed
incorrectly
.
it
also
suggests
that
,
the
frequency
of
glove
bag
work
,
rather
than
the
size
of
the
removal
project
is
more
relevant
to
its
effectiveness
.
other
participants
echoed
this
caution
,
for
example
,
david
kirby
of
oak
ridge
national
laboratory
testified
that
glove
bag
usage
should
be
conditioned
on
showing
quarterly
frequency
of
glove
bag
usage
