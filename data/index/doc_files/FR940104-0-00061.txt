epa
has
adopted
a
scenariobased
scenario
based
regional
modeling
approach
that
uses
input
parameters
developed
for
regions
of
the
us
.
where
sawmills
are
more
prevalent
.
in
this
approach
,
epa
uses
average
and
highend
high
end
values
for
estimating
model
input
parameters
on
a
regional
basis
because
information
does
not
exist
on
the
actual
means
and
distributions
of
these
parameters
for
the
regions
modeled
.
the
agency
believes
that
this
approach
is
an
appropriate
one
and
,
furthermore
,
that
the
resulting
model
estimates
bracket
or
bound
the
uncertainty
associated
with

parameters
.
two
commenters
questioned
the
use
of
cancer
as
the
endpoint
of
concern
for
2378tcdd
tcdd
.
epa
disagrees
.
the
cancer
endpoint
for
tcdd
was
selected
because
it
is
the
most
sensitive
endpoint
for
which
qualitative
dose
response
data
are
available
.
2378tcdd
tcdd
has
been
demonstrated
to
be
a
potent
carcinogen
in
animals
and
has
been
classified
as
a
b2
(
potential
human
)
carcinogen
.
recently
published
epidemiological
studies
of
occupationally
exposed
individuals
report
significant
increases
in
cancer
mortality
.
2378tcdd
tcdd
also
has
potent
reproductive
and
teratogenic
endpoints
and
enough
data
exist
to
estimate
a
reference
dose
(
rfd
)
based
on
these
alternative
shortterm
short
term
effects
.
(
for
a
detailed
discussion
of
this
information
,
and
for
references
to
studies
supporting
these
conclusions
,
the
reader
is
referred
to
the
background
document
of
the
proposed
rule
)
however
,
if
healthbased
health
based
levels
(
hbls
)
are
calculated
using
the
reproductive
effect
rfd
,
the
exposure
level
is
an
order
of
magnitude
higher
than
the
level
calculated
using
the
carcinogen
slope
factor
(
csf
.
thus
,
if
the
cancer
endpoint
end
point
is
used
as
the
basis
for
calculating
a
permissible
exposure
level
,
it
also
will
be
protective
against
shortterm
short
term
exposures
such
as
those
associated
with
reproductive
effects
.
the
issue
of
2378tcdd
tcdd
toxicity
is
being
reassessed
by
epa
(
outside
the
framework
of
this
rulemaking
)
and
all
endpoints
are
being
considered
.
tcdd
has
been
observed
to
express
a
wide
variety
of
effects
including
teratogenesis
,
reproductive
effects
,
and
suppression
of
the
immune
system
function
in
many
species
.
mechanistic
approaches
to
understanding
and
identifying
toxic
effects
levels
are
also
being
considered
.
until
the
reassessment
process
has
been
completed
,
the
epa
will
continue
to
use
the
current
carcinogenicity
endpoint
csf
value
that
has
been
accepted
as
the
basis
for
the
mcl
.
two
commenters
noted
limitations
associated
with
the
use
of
the

factors
(
tefs
)
methodology
.
they
argued
that
the
tef
methodology
should
not
be
used
to
justify
the
addition
of
appendix
viii
in
the
absence
of
valid
toxicological
studies
that
demonstrate
actual
health
effects
associated
with
exposure
to
these
compounds
.
one
commenter
questioned
the
proposal
to
add
octachlorodibenzopdioxin
octachlorodibenzo
p
dioxin
(
ocdd
)
and
octachlorodibenzofuran
(
ocdf
)
to
40
cfr
part

,
appendix
viii
.
the
commenters
stated
that
neither
compound
has
been
shown
to
produce
toxic
,
carcinogenic
,
mutagenic
or
teratogenic
effects
on
humans
or
other
life
forms
.
the
agency
has
decided
not
to
add
,
at
this
time
,
ocdd
and
ocdf
to
appendix
viii
of
40
cfr
part
261
.
although
the
original
basis
for
including
these
congeners
on
appendix
viii
remains
valid
(
details
of
which
can
be
found
in
the
background
document
supporting
this
final
rulemaking
,
the
agency
is
investigating
further
the

submitted

regarding
the
effects
of
ocdd

ocdf
reported
in
the

associated
with

of

of
chlorinated
dibenzopdioxins
dibenzo
p
dioxins
and
dibenzofurans
and
the
1989

.
ocdd
and
ocdf
are
the
most
prevalent
of
the
pcdd
and
pcdf
congeners
accounting
for
approximately
85
percent
of
the
total
cdd

cdf
present
in
five
of

when
administered

these
findings
have
been
confirmed
by
a
second
subchronic

study
conducted
in

.
ocdd
and
ocdf
have
not
exhibited
toxicity
in
short

studies
;
however
,
acute
exposure
is
not
the
only
concern
of
epa
.
the
agency
is
currently
reevaluating
evaluating
its
original
assessment
of
risks
from

at
this
point
,
the

wishes
to

on

one

questioned
the

the
epa
recognizes
that

not
necessarily
always
be
protective
of

however
