kt
reported
an
average
home
market
packing
labor
expense
for
the
poi
based
on
the
packing
labor
expenses
incurred
during
each
month
of
the
period
.
petitioners
contend
that
the
department
should
use
the
monthly
packing
labor
expenses
in
calculating
kts
home
market
packing
expenses
instead
of
the
poi
average
.
petitioners
assert
that
the
departments
longstanding
policy
is
to
use
data
that
are
as
salesspecific
sales
specific
as
possible
.
according
to
petitioners
,
in
this
case
the
most
specific
data
available
are
the
monthly
costs
.
kt
argues
that
using
monthly
packing
labor
costs
would
distort
kts
per
unit
packing
expenses
.
kt
maintains
that
it
is
appropriate
to
spread
packing
labor
expenses
over
the
sales
quantities
during
the
entire
sixmonth
six
month
poi
because
of
fluctuations
in
monthly
sales
volumes
.
kt
asserts
that
this
methodology
yields
a
more
representative
per
unit
expense
for
the
poi
because
packing
labor
is
a
fixed
cost
.
doc
position
:
we
agree
with
kt
.
normally
,
the
department
prefers
respondents
to
report
transactionspecific
transaction
specific
expenses
under
the
theory
that
individual
prices
are
set
to
cover
individual
(
(
ie
.
,
,
transactionspecific
transaction
specific
)
costs
.
in
this
case
,
however
,
the
costs
are
not
transactionspecific
transaction
specific
.
moreover
,
because
kts
packing
labor
expenses
are
fixed
,
they
do
not
vary
by
sales
volume
.
therefore
,
fluctuations
in
the
monthly
sales
volumes
create
differences
in
the
monthly
average
expense
amounts
.
because
these
fluctuations
in
sales
expenses
are
not
translated
into
changes
in
the
per
unit
prices
,
they
distort
the
margin
calculation
.
we
agree
with
kt
that
using
the
poiaverage
poi
average
minimizes
the
effect
of
these
fluctuations
.
therefore
,
we
find
that
the
poi
average
is
more
representative
of
kts
per
unit
packing
labor
costs
.
accordingly
,
we
have
accepted
this
average
for
purposes
of
the
final
determination
.

that

and
is
the

respondent
adds
that
because
the
bill

is
the

on

the

would
be

however

the
