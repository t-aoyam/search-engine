fhwas
determination
statistical
studies
mentioned
above
support
the
proposition
that
accidentfree
accident
free
performance
coupled
with
low
numbers
of
traffic
violations
over
a
threeyear
three
year
period
is
a
reliable
predictor
of
continued
safe
performance
over
a
similar
period
in
the
future
.
as
a
condition
of
admission
into
the
waiver
program
,
each
applicant
had
to
demonstrate
a
threeyear
three
year
period
of
safe
driving
performance
prior
to
being
admitted
into
the
study
group
.
the
performance
data
obtained
from
the
waived
drivers
since
the
study
began
confirms
the
fhwas
determination
that
the
continued
operation
of
the
waived
group
,
as
provided
for
in
this
notice
,
will
not
diminish
safety
.
the
data
also
show
that
this
class
of
drivers
performed
and
is
performing
more
safely
than
the
pool
of
drivers
from
which
its
replacements
would
have
to
be
drawn
,
that
is
,
the
general
driving
population
.
accordingly
,
the
fhwa
has
determined
that
to
revalidate
waivers
,
as
stated
in
this
notice
,
for
drivers
in
the
class
of
drivers
defined
by
the
study
and
operating
under
the
conditions
of
the
study
is
consistent
with
the
safe
operation
of
cmvs
.
this
evidence
,
examined
in
conjunction
with
the
previously
available
medical
and
scientific
evidence
,
and
detailed
driving
records
provided
prior
to
acceptance
into
the
waiver
program
and
periodically
thereafter
by
each
individual
participating
in
the
waiver
group
,
clearly
indicates
that
the
continued
operation
of
cmvs
by
the
group
of
drivers
currently
participating
in
the
waiver
program
will
not
adversely
affect
cmv
safety
.
the
fhwa
has
also
determined
that
to
conduct
the
waiver
study
program
under
the
conditions
prescribed
herein
is
consistent
with
the
public
interest
of
assuring
the
physical
condition
of
operators
of
cmvs
is
adequate
to
enable
them
to
operate
the
vehicles
safely
and
of
providing
opportunities
for
drivers
with
real
or
perceived
visual
disabilities
to
demonstrate
their
ability
to
drive
safely
and
continue
in
their
chosen
field
of
occupation
.
finally
,
the
fhwa
believes
that
the
information
contained
in
this
notice
provides
a
sufficient
degree
of
empirical
evidence
to
satisfy
the
safety
requirement
mandated
by
both
the
mcsa
and
the
dc
.
circuit
court
.
revalidation
of
waivers
and
request
for
comments
in
view
of
the
above
,
the
agency
is
revalidating
the
vision
waivers
possessed
by
drivers
as
of
09/30/1994
,
for
thirty
days
from
the
date
of
this
notice
.
the
fhwa
is
also
proposing
that
this
evidence
is
sufficient
to
allow
those
drivers
currently
participating
in
the
vision
waiver
study
(
2411
as
of
09/30/1994
)
to
continue
operating
cmvs
with
waivers
,
subject
to
the
same
standards
and
conditions
applicable
to
the
original
waivers
,
for
the
duration
of
the
study
,
which
shall
conclude
not
later
than
03/31/1996
.
by
that
date
,
approximately
93
percent
of
the
drivers
presently
participating
in
the
study
will
have
completed
at
least
three
years
driving
in
the
study
program
.
the
fhwa
is
requesting
comments
on
this
proposal
.
a
short
comment
period
is
necessitated
by
the
precarious
position
in
which
the
drivers
participating
in
the
study
,
as
well
as
the
fhwa
,
are
placed
by
virtue
of
the
courts
decision
.
if
this
determination
is
delayed
,
individuals
who
have
received
a
waiver
from
the
application
of
certain
regulations
will
immediately
be
subject
to
irreparable
harm
in
the
form
of
job
loss
and
financial
hardship
.
moreover
,
if
the
agency
allows
the
waiver
program
to
continue
without
presenting
a
reasoned
analysis
and
justification
,
it
could
be
found
to
be
acting
contrary
to
the
order
of
the
court
.
finally
,
this
additional
period
of
15
days
for
comments
will
allow
for
the
submission
of
persuasive
reasons
why
the
fhwa
should
not
complete
its
study
by
revalidating
waivers
to
the
study
participants
subject
to
the
same
standards
or
conditions
.
public
hearing
on
the
vision
standard
and
waiver
program
due
to
the
strong
public
interest
surrounding
this
matter
,
the
fhwa
will
conduct
a
public
hearing
within
six
months
of
the
date
of
this
notice
of
determination
to
explore
the
remaining
issues
surrounding
the
vision
standard
and
the
vision
waiver
program
.
examples
of
issues
to
be
addressed
at
the
public
hearing
include
:
(
1
)
the
relationship
of
visual
capacity
to
the
commercial
driving
task
;
(

)
identification
of
research
and

in
defining
the
