training
for
hvac
maintenance
workers
and
informing
employees
about
the
indoor
air
quality
standard
.
the
proposed
standard
requires
training
for
all
building
maintenance
workers
involved
in
building
system
operation
and
maintenance
.
standards
of
maintenance
vary
dramatically
in
the
hvac
industry
and
sometimes
are
deficient
where
untrained
personnel
are
designated
to
maintain
very
complex
systems
.
training
programs
for
workers
must
include
at
least
information
on
:
(
1
)
how
to
maintain
adequate
ventilation
of
air
contaminants
generated
during
building
cleaning
and
maintenance
,
and
(

)
how
to
minimize
adverse
effects
on
indoor
air
quality
during
the
use
and
disposal
of
chemicals
and
other
agents
.
the
exact
cost
of
training
will
vary
among
establishments
depending
on
whether
employees
are
trained
inhouse
in
house
or
sent
to
outside
training
programs
or
consultants
.
osha
estimated
the
costs
for
the
trainer
who
must
research
,
prepare
and
direct
the
sessions
.
for
the
time
involved
in
the
training
session
,
a
range
of
costs
for
the
instructor
could
be
developed
.
for
example
,
the
wage
costs
for
the
trainer
could
represent
from
50
percent
of
the
trainee
labor
costs
(
if
there
are
only
two
in
the
class
)
to
5
percent
if
there
are
20
trainees
in
a
class
.
for
the
preparation
time
,
osha
judged
that
the
trainer
will
require
a
special
study
seminar
,
such
as
that
taught
by
the
building
owners
and
managers
