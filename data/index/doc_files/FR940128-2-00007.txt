respondents
argument
that
the
department
used
the
further

cost
totals
on

c1
us
.
sales
tape
at
the
preliminary
determination
is
unavailing
.
at
the
preliminary
determination
,
the
department
used
the
further
manufacturing
totals
from
the
c1
sales
tape
only
because
respondent
did
not
provide
a
means
to
link
the
c1
and
e2
tapes
in
time
for
the
preliminary
determination
.
since
there
was
no
way
to
link
these
tapes
(
until
after
the
preliminary
determination
,
when
we
received
new
tapes
in
response
to
the
departments
request
,
and
since
the
total
product
further
manufacturing
costs
were
the
same
on
both
the
e2
and
c1
databases
,
we
simply
used
the
total
cost
figures
on
the
c1
database
.
this
was
not
the
case
at
the
final
determination
,
where
a
way
to
link
these
tapes
was
available
and
where
we
had
to
adjust
certain
cost
elements
on
the
e2
database
.
on
01/10/1994
,
petitioners
alleged
that
the
department
made
three
clerical
errors
in
the
final
determination
.
first
,
petitioners
alleged
that
the
department
miscalculated
the
test
which
ensures
that
selling
,
general
and
administrative
(
sgampa
)
expenses
are
not
less
than
ten
percent
of
the
cost
of
manufacture
(
com
.
specifically
,
petitioners
stated
that
the
departments
instructions
require
com
to
be
multiplied
by
one
percent
and
not
ten
percent
.
we
agree
that
this
error
is
a
clerical
error
.
in
attempting
to
make
sure
that
sgampa
expenses
were
not
less
than
ten
percent
of
the
com
,
we
mistakenly
multiplied
the
com
by
one
percent
instead
of
ten
percent
.
therefore
,
we
corrected
this
error
by
multiplying
the
com
by
ten
percent
.
secondly
,
petitioners
alleged
that
the
department
failed
to
include
united
states
commissions
in
the
valueadded
value
added
tax
(
vat
)
readjustment
calculation
,
pursuant
to
which
we
made
a
deduction
from
foreign
market
value
for
purchase
price
comparisons
.
after
a
review
of
petitioners
'
allegation
and
the
departments
new
vat
calculation
methodology
,
we
have
determined
that
this
was
a
clerical
error
.
therefore
,
we
have
included
commissions
in
the
vat
readjustment
calculation
.
finally
,
petitioners
alleged
that
the
department
double
counted
home
market
indirect
selling
expenses
when
deducting
this
expense
from
foreign
market
value
during
comparisons
of
constructed
value
to
exporters
sales
price
.
the
department
agrees
that
the
double
deduction
of
indirect
selling
expenses
from
foreign
market
value
during
comparisons
of
constructed
value
to
exporters
sales
price
was
a
clerical
error
.
to
correct
this
error
,
the
department
eliminated
the
separate
variable
for
indirect
selling
expenses
from
the
foreign
unit
price
string
.

further
discussion
of
these
clerical
errors
