to
reflect
these
changes
,
the
agency
is
proposing
to
amend
the
regulations
governing
the
grading
of
shell
eggs
and
the
us
.
standards
,
grades
,
and
weight
classes
for
shell
eggs
in

part

.
proposed
changes
the
proposal
would
redefine
`
quality
assurance
inspector
'
to
exclude
from
this
designation
a
plant
owner
,
manager
,
foreman
,
or
supervisor
and
to
clarify
that
the
quality
assurance
inspector
is
authorized
to
examine
product
.
the
revision
is
necessary
to
eliminate
the
possibility
that
someone
with
a
financial
interest
in
the
product
or
having
managerial
responsibilities
would
be
designated
as
a
quality
assurance
inspector
.
the
revision
also
would
clarify
that
examining
or
sampling
product
is
a
primary
responsibility
required
of
a
quality
assurance
inspector
.
the
proposal
would
also
define
the
term
`
washed
ungraded
eggs
'
to
mean
shell
eggs
which
have
been
washed
but
not
subject
to
any
grading
or
segregation
for
quality
.
this
addition
is
necessary
to
facilitate
the
trading
,
certification
,
and
identification
of
shell
eggs
from
processing
facilities
where
shell
eggs
move
continuously
from
laying
house
to
processing
facilities
without
being
graded
.
such
shell
eggs
cannot
be
classified
as
nest
run
eggs
because
they
have
been
washed
and
are
not
intended
for
consumer
sales
because
they
have
not
been
graded
.
the
proposal
would
update
the
regulations
to
comply
with
current
statutory
requirements
regarding
providing
grading
services
and
licensing
graders
without
discrimination
due
to
age
or
disability
.
the
facilities
and
equipment
which
the
applicant
furnishes
the
grader
would
be
revised
to
include
other
facilities
and
equipment
as
may
otherwise
be
required
.
as
new
equipment
has
been
developed
and
installed
in
official
plants
,
additional
items
have
been
required
to
perform
normal
grading
activities
.
the
proposal
would
specifically
require
the
applicant
to
provide
any
adequate
facilities
and
equipment
necessary
to
perform
grading
activities
as
changes
in
technology
and
production
practices
dictate
.
the
proposal
would
revise
the
regulations
to
comply
with
the
nutrition
labeling
and
education
act
of
1990
,
which
requires
nutrition
labeling
on
most
foods
that
are
regulated
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
.
the
proposal
would
revise
the
existing
method
of
identifying
cartons
to
require
that
each
officially
identified
carton
of
shell
eggs
be
lot
numbered
on
either
the
carton
or
the
consumer
package
.
the
current
regulations
specify
that
the
cartons
shall
be
lot
numbered
on
the
carton
or
the
tape
used
to
seal
the
carton
.
the
shell
egg
industry
does
not
use
tape
to
seal
cartons
in
their
current
production
practices
.
this
revision
would
update
the
regulations
to
reflect
current
production
practices
and
in
addition
provide
flexibility
to
accommodate
future
changes
that
the
industry
may
devise
for
officially
identifying
shell
eggs
.
in
addition
,
the
proposal
would
revise
the
minimum
facility
and
operating
requirements
for
shell
egg
grading
and
packing
plants
by
updating
grading
room
requirements
.
the
current
regulations
describe
handcandling
hand
candling
operations
which
are
outof
out
of
date
because
almost
all
shell
egg
processing
is
done
mechanically
.
regulations
are
needed
which
define
the
grading
room
requirements
of
a
mechanized
shell
egg
processing
operation
.
the
proposed
revision
will
specifically
define
the
requirements
of
a
mechanized
shell
egg
operation
while
providing
the
flexibility
to
approve
the
acceptability
of
all
grading
rooms
.
shell
egg
cleaning
operations
also
would
be
revised
to
require
that
the
temperature
of
the
water
used
to
spray
rinse
shell
eggs
be
at
least
as
warm
as
the
water
used
to
wash
the
shell
eggs
.
the
current
regulations
require
that
washed
shell
eggs
be
spray
rinsed
with
warm
water
.
this
revision
would
specify
that
`
warm
'
means
at
least
the
temperature
of
the
water
used
to
wash
the
shell
eggs
and
would
also
bring
the
regulations
in
line
with
current
washing
and
sanitizing
practices
which
help
reduce
bacterial
contamination
of
shell
eggs
.
if
shell
eggs
are
subjected
to
a
sanitizing
spray
rinse
which
is
colder
than
the
water
used
to
wash
them
,
the
probability
of
bacterial
contamination
increases
because
the
cold
water
causes
the
shell
contents
to
contract
which
allows
contaminants
to
be
drawn
through
the
shell
of
the
egg
.
additionally
,
the
revisions
would
specifically
authorize
the
national
supervisor
to
approve
methods
of
sanitizing
shell
eggs
other
than
the
normal
spray
rinse
method
.
this
revision
will
provide
the
flexibility
to
accommodate
future
changes
in
the
technology
of
sanitizing
shell
eggs
and
to
adapt
to
new
waste
management
requirements
.
the
agency
is
proposing
to
delete
us
.
wholesale
grades
and
weight
classes
for
shell
eggs
.
this
is
necessary
because
wholesale
grades
are
difficult
to
understand
and
are
virtually
unused
.
almost
all
shell
eggs
moving
in
commerce
today
are
sold
on
the
basis
of
the
us
.
consumer
grades
,
us
.
nestrun
nest
run
grades
,
company
approved
specifications
,
or
sold
without
certification
.
the
agency
is
proposing
to
revise
the
existing
standards
for
b
quality
in
us
.
nestrun
nest
run
grades
for
shell
eggs
by
allowing
shell
eggs
with
pronounced
ridges
and
thin
spots
to
be
included
in
the
maximum
percentage
tolerance
permitted
for
b
quality
.
the
standard
for
b
quality
currently
defines
abnormal
in
part
as
exhibiting
pronounced
ridges
and
thin
spots
.
the
proposed
revision
would
provide
uniformity
between
the
b
quality
description
for
us
.
nestrun
nest
run
grades
and
the
standards
for
b
quality
.
