once
the
floor
has
been
determined
for
new
or
existing
sources
for
a
category
or
subcategory
,
the
administrator
must
set
mact
standards
no
less
stringent
.
such
standards
must
then
be
met
by
all
sources
within
the
category
or
subcategory
.
however
,
in
establishing
standards
,
the
administrator
may
distinguish
among
classes
,
types
,
and
sizes
of
sources
within
a
category
or
subcategory
and
establish
a
different
emission
standard
for
each
class
,
provided
all
standards
are
at
least
as
stringent
as
the
mact
floor
.
the
epa
has
determined
that
there
are
less
than
30
major
shipbuilding
sources
.
consequently
,
the
mact
floor
for
existing
categories
or
subcategories
was
calculated
to
be
the
arithmetic
average
(
the
mean

regulatory
approach
and
regulatory
alternatives
the
next
step
in
establishing
standards
is
the
investigation
of
regulatory
alternatives
.
with
mact
standards
,
only
alternatives
at
least
as
stringent
as
the
floor
may
be
considered
.
information
about
the
industry
is
analyzed
to
develop
model
plant
populations
for
projecting
national
impacts
,
including
hap
emission
reduction
levels
,
costs
,
energy
,
and
secondary
impacts
.
several
regulatory
alternative
levels
(
which
may
be
different
levels
of
emissions
control
or
different
levels
of
applicability
or
both
)
are
then
evaluated
to
determine
the
most
appropriate
regulatory
alternative
to
serve
as
the
basis
for
the
standard
.
the
regulatory
alternatives
for
new
versus
existing
sources
may
be
different
,
and
separate
regulatory
decisions
must
be
made
for
new
and
existing
sources
.
for
both
source
types
,
the
selected
alternative
may
be
more
stringent
than
the
mact
floor
.
however
,
the
control
level
selected
as
the
name
maximum
achievable
control
technology
indicates
,
must
be
available
,
ie
,
technically
achievable
.
in
selecting
a
regulatory
alternative
,
the
agency
considers
the
achievable
reduction
in
emissions
of
hap
(
and
possibly
other
pollutants
that
are
cocontrolled
controlled
,
the
cost
and
economic
impacts
,
the
energy
requirements
,
and
other
environmental
impacts
.
the
selected
regulatory
alternative
is
then
translated
into
a
proposed
regulation
.
the
regulation
implementing
the
decision
typically
includes
the
following
sections
:
applicability
,
standards
,
test
methods
,
compliance
demonstration
,
monitoring
,
reporting
,
and
recordkeeping
.
the
preamble
to
the
proposed
regulation
provides
an
explanation
of
the
rationale
for
the
decisions
embodied
in
the
rule
.
the
public
is
invited
to
comment
on
the
proposed
regulation
.
based
on
an
evaluation
of
these
comments
,
the
epa
promulgates
the
final
standard
.
