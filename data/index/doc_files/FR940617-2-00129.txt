orr
first
instituted
a
setaside
set
aside
for
maas
over
10
years
ago
as
an
incentive
to
states
to
work
with
and
fund
maas
.
at
that
time
,
maas
were
emerging
as
important
organizations
in
the
refugee
resettlement
field
.
we
felt
that
states
needed
to
be
encouraged
to
begin
funding
these
organizations
as
service
providers
.
today
,
the
situation
is
quite
different
;
we
believe
that
maas
are
now
in
a
position
to
compete
effectively
for
refugee
social
services
funds
.
many
maas
have
succeeded
in
becoming
highly
qualified
and
experienced
service
agencies
and
,
in
many
states
,
have
been
able
to
obtain
a
much
higher
level
of
refugee
social
service
funding
than
is
available
under
the
maa
setaside
set
aside
.
for
this
reason
,
we
believe
the
maa
setaside
set
aside
has
served
its
purpose
and
should
be
discontinued
at
the
federal
level
.
this
in
no
way
suggests
that
states
should
lower
their
commitment
to
using
maas
to
provide
services
to
refugees
;
to
the
contrary
,
we
expect
and
encourage
states
to
continue
to
use
maas
as
service
providers
at
levels
comparable
to
previous
years
.
in
addition
,
maas
may
compete
for
funding
under
orrs
discretionary
programs
which
are
open
to
nonprofit
organizations
.
we
inadvertently
deleted
the
language
that
has
appeared
in
previous
notices
requiring
states
to
assist
maas
in
seeking
other
public
and
or
private
funds
for
the
provision
of
services
to
refugee
clients
.
we
have
included
similar
language
in
this
notice
which
strongly
encourages
,
but
does
not
require
,
states
to
assist
maas
in
seeking
other
public
and
or
private
funds
for
the
provision
of
services
.
comment
:
two
commenters
requested
clarification
regarding
orrs
expectation
that
states
should
ensure
that
refugee
social
services
are
provided
to
special
populations
such
as
amerasians
and
former
political
prisoners
from
vietnam
.
one
commenter
made
the
point
that
all
refugees
are
special
populations
.
another
commenter
felt
that
while
a
state
can
ensure
that
services
are
made
available
to
special
populations
,
a
state
cannot
ensure
that
services
are
provided
,
since
it
cannot
ensure
that
refugees
will
access
the
services
offered
.
the
commenter
suggested
that
the
language
in
the
notice
be
revised
to
acknowledge
this
distinction
.
response
:
the
phrase
`
such
as
'
is
not
intended
to
suggest
an
inclusive
list
of
special
populations
,
but
simply
to
provide
examples
of
such
special
populations
.
we
agree
that
states
can
only
ensure
that
services
are
made
available
to
refugees
.
the
language
in
the
notice
has
been

comment
:
two
commenters
requested
clarification
regarding
orrs
expectation
that
states
should
ensure
that
a
coherent
plan
of
services
is
developed
for
each
eligible
family
that
addresses
the
familys
needs
from
time
of
arrival
until
attainment
of
economic
independence
.
one
commenter
pointed
out
that
a
plan
of
services
can
only
be
developed
for
individuals
and
families
that
access
services
and
recommended
that
the
language
in
the
notice
be
revised
to
clarify
this
point
.
the
commenter
also
questioned
how
the
definition
of
an
`
eligible
family
'
would
apply
to
recent
arrivals
who
are
single
.
another
commenter
questioned
what
is
meant
by
`
a
coherent
plan
of
services
from
time
of
arrival
until
attainment
of
economic
independence
.
response
:
our
intent
regarding
a
coherent
plan
of
services
is
for
such
a
plan
to
be
developed
for
every
family
that
applies
for
services
or
receives
cash
assistance
.
we
believe
that
a
state
can
ensure
that
this
is
carried
out
by
requiring
its
providers
to
develop
such
plans
.
refugees
who
are
single
individuals
,
without
family
,
should
be
considered
an
eligible
oneperson
one
person
family
unit
.
`
a
coherent
plan
of
services
from
time
of
arrival
until
attainment
of
economic
independence
'
means
the
development
of
a
comprehensive
service
plan
that
includes
the
provision
of
employmentrelated
employment
related
and
other
services
needed
to
help
a
newly
arrived
family

comment
:
three
commenters
commented
on
orrs
expectation
that
services
should
be
provided
in
a
manner
that
is
culturally
and
linguistically
compatible
.
two
of
the
commenters
indicated
that
this
expectation
would
require
the
provision
of
services
through
a
refugeespecific
refugee
specific
system
which
,
they
felt
,
would
be
financially
impractical
.
both
commenters
felt
that
it
would
be
more
costeffective
cost
effective
to
fold
refugee
services
into
the
existing
mainstream
system
.
another
commenter
expressed
support
for
the
provision
of
services
through
a
refugeespecific
refugee
specific
system
.
one
commenter
asked
for
a
clear
definition
of
what
`
culturally
and
linguistically
compatible
'
means
.
response
:
what
orr
means
by
the
provision
of
services
in
a
manner
that
is
culturally
and
linguistically
compatible
is
that
an
agency
providing
refugee
social
services
must
employ
or
contract
with
staff
who
(
1
)
speak
the
native
language
of
and
(
2
)
are
either
from
the
same
ethnic
background
as
,
or
are
culturally
knowledgeable
of
,
the
refugee
populations
the
agency
serves
,
and
must
use
these
staff
in
the
provision
of
services
to
refugee
clients
.
regarding
the
costeffectiveness
cost
effectiveness
of
a
refugeespecific
refugee
specific
service
system
,
we
believe
that
the
investment
of
refugee
program
funds
in
a
refugeespecific
refugee
specific
service
system
,
particularly
in
the
initial
years
after
a
refugees
arrival
in
the
us
,
will
prove
to
be
more
costeffective
cost
effective
in
the
long
run
than
serving
refugees
through
a
mainstream
system
.
the
provision
of
services
through
a
service
provider
system
whose
only
clientele
is
refugees
is
likely
to
result
in
more
tailored
and
comprehensive
services
to
refugees
,
resulting
,
we
believe
,
in
earlier
employment
and
selfsufficiency
self
sufficiency
than
what
would
otherwise
occur
when
refugees
are
served
through
a
mainstream
system
.
refugees
often
tend
to
receive
minimal
services
or
are
the
last
to
be
served
in
mainstream
systems
where
they
are
one
of
many
client
groups
served
.
we
wish
to
emphasize
,
however
,
that
there
is
nothing
to
preclude
,
and
in
fact
we
encourage
,
the
use
of
mainstream
resources
to
augment
the
services
provided
through
a
refugeespecific
refugee
specific
service
system
.
