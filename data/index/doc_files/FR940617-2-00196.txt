may
request
that
the
secretary
determine
whether
such
substance
should
be

add
such
substance
to

,
the
secretary
determined
that
tetrahydrofuran
and
14
butanediol
should
be
added
to
the
list
of
taxable
substances
in
section
4672a3

.
however
,
if
these
substances
are
produced
from
acetylene
derived
from
coal
they
are
not
taxable
substances
.
the
rate
of
tax
prescribed
for
tetrahydrofuran
,
under
section
4671b3
,
is
$
5
28
per
ton
unless
it
is
produced
from
acetylene
derived
from
coal
.
this
is
based
upon
a
conversion
factor
for
acetylene
of
0
40
and
a
conversion
factor
for
methane
of
0
97
.
the
rate
of

tetrahyrofuran
is
derived
from
the
taxable
chemicals
methane
and
acetylene
.
tetrahyrofuran
is
a
liquid
produced
predominantly
by
the
reaction
of
acetylene
(
derived
from
methane
in
natural
gas
)
with
formaldehyde
made
by
air
oxidation
and
dehydrogenation
of
methanol
(
derived
from
methane
in
natural
gas
)
producing
the
intermediate
butynediol
which
is
in
turn
reacted
with
hydrogen
(
derived
from
methane
in
natural
gas
)
to
produce
14
butanediol
.
the
14
butanediol
is
ring
closed
using
an
acid
catalyst
to
produce
tetrahydrofuran
.
the
stoichiometric
material
consumption
formula
for
tetrahyrofuran
is

tetrahyrofuran
has
been
determined
to
be
a
taxable
substance
because
a
review
of
its
stoichiometric
material
consumption
formula
shows
that
,
based
on
the
predominant
method
of
production
,
taxable
chemicals
constitute
587
percent
by
weight
of
the
materials
used
in
its
production
.

14
butanediol
has
been
determined
to
be
a

substance
because

of
its
stoichiometric
