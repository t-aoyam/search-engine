amendment
32
would
establish
a
plan
to
rebuild
stocks
of
the
rockfish
pacific
ocean
perch
(
pop
)
(
(
sebastes
alutus
)
)
in
the
gulf
of
alaska
(
goa
.
pop
is
a
highly
valued
groundfish
.
it
was
heavily
exploited
by
a
foreign
trawl
fleet
from
the
early
1960s
until
the
mid1980s
mid
.
thereafter
,
a
domestic
atsea
at
sea
processing
fleet
harvested
pop
at
a
substantially
lower
rate
.
catches
of
pop
peaked
in
1965
when
an
estimated
350000
metric
tons
(
mt
)
were
harvested
by
the
foreign
fleet
;
catches
declined
sharply
in
the
late
1960s
.
from
19611977
,
annual
pop
landings
averaged
over
40000
mt
;
after
1977
,
landings
averaged
6000
mt
.
in
the
domestic
fishery
,
pop
was
managed
as
part
of
a
larger
slope
rockfish
assemblage
of
about
20
species
until
1991
,
when
pop
was
established
as
a
separate
target
species
category
to
prevent
possible
overfishing
.
as
a
result
of
increased
concern
about
the
status
of
pop
stocks
,
biomass
assessment
methodology
has
been
improved
and
domestic
harvest
levels
have
been
reduced
.
the
1993
total
allowable
catch
(
tac
)
of
2560
mt
was
available
only
as
incidental
catch
in
other
groundfish
fisheries
.
in
recent
years
pop
has
been
managed
as
a
single
species
,
harvest
levels
have
been
reduced
,
and
directed
fisheries
have
been
restricted
or
eliminated
.
in
spite
of
this
conservative
management
in
recent
years
,
pop
biomass
has
increased
only
slightly
and
remains
depressed
from
historic
levels
.
the
current
spawner
biomass
of
about
71000
mt
is
estimated
to
be
1520
percent
of
the
level
observed
during
the
1960s
.
the
council
believes
that
increasing
the
biomass
of
pop
to
a
level
closer
to
historical
amounts
is
necessary
to
achieve
optimum
yield
in
the
pop
fishery
.
factors
other
than
fishing
mortality
contribute
to
the
continued
depressed
state
of
the
pop
resource
.
ecosystem
changes
or
other
biological
factors
may
preclude
rebuilding
success
.
nevertheless
,
the
council
considers
minimizing
pop
mortality
necessary
to
maximize
the
probability
of
rebuilding
success
in
a
realistic
time
period
.
additionally
,
decreasing
pop
mortality
should
minimize
resource
waste
associated
with
low
tacs
that
do
not
fully
accommodate
incidental
catch
needs
of
existing
fisheries
.
