as
stated
in
the
11/19/1992
,
osha
continues
to
believe
that
the
major
advantage
of
such
a
regulatory
approach
is
that
the
materials
and
buildings
facilities
with
the
greatest
risk
potential
would
be
automatically
targeted
for
mandatory
communication
and
control
procedures
,
and
possible
testing
.
focusing
on
highrisk
high
risk
building
facility
situations
avoids
the
dilution
of
resources
and
attention
which
might
result
from
requiring
broader
inspections
.
other
building
facility
areas
and
material
would
not
be
exempt
from
the
standards
control
requirements
;
however
,
they
would
not
be
presumptively
considered
to
contain
asbestos
.
if
a
building
owner
or
employer
has
actual
knowledge
of
the
asbestos
content
of
materials
,
they
must
comply
with
the
protective
provisions
in
the
standard
.
similarly
if
there
is
good
cause
to
know
that
material
is
asbestos
containing
the
employer
and
or
building
owner
is
deemed
to
know
that
fact
.
the
current
enforcement
rules
governing
`
employer
knowledge
'
would
be
applied
in
a
contested
case
to
determine
the
application
of
the
asbestos
standard
to
other
materials
or
building
facility
areas
which
the
employer
claims
he
did
not
know
contained
asbestos
.
osha
believes
that
this
presumptive
approach
allows
building
facility
owners
whose
buildings
facilities
contain
pacm
and
other
employers
of
employees
potentially
exposed
to
pacm
flexibility
to
choose
the
most
costeffective
cost
effective
way
to
protect
employees
.
they
may
treat
the
material
as
if
it
contains
asbestos
and
provide
appropriate
required
training
to
the
custodial
staff
;
test
the
material
and
rebut
the
presumptions
;
or
combine
strategies
.
osha
considered
a
number
of
approaches
to
insure
that
workers
do
not
become
exposed
to
asbestos
unknowingly
.
as
noted
in
the
1992
notice
,
one
option
was
clarifying
in
the
preamble
to
the
final
rule
the
current
enforcement
policy
that
a
prudent
building
facility
owner
or
other
employer
exercising
`
due
diligence
'
is
expected
to
identify
certain
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
materials
in
his
her
building
facility
before
disturbing
them
.
after
reviewing
the
record
,
osha
believes
its
presumption
approach
is
more
protective
.
`
due
diligence
'
is
,
in
part
,
a
legal
defense
,
invoked
by
and
in
order
to
shelter
employers
against
osha
citation
.
thus
in
the
past
,
employers
who
were
wrongly
informed
by
building
owners
about
the
asbestos
content
of
thermal
system
insulation
successfully
argued
in
some
cases
that
they
had
exercised
`
due
diligence
'
osha
believes
that
the
protection
of
employees
must
not
depend
on
the
good
faith
of
their
employers
whose
information
sources
may
be
defective
.
by
requiring
that
tsi
and
troweled
-
and
sprayedon
sprayed
on
surfacing
material
be
handled
as
if
they
contain
asbestos
,
employees
will
be
protected
from
the
consequences
of
their
employers
relying
on
erroneous
information
about
the
most
risky
asbestos
materials
.
of
course
,
`
due
diligence
'
would
also
require
employers
to
investigate
whether
other
building
material
about
which
there
was
information
suggesting
asbestos
content
,
was
in
fact

a

other

may
presume
they
are

asbestos
containing
,
label
and
treat
work
with
them
as
asbestos
work
,
without
testing
the
material
for

content
.
another
option
osha
considered
was
requiring
a
comprehensive
aheratype
ahera
type
(
epas

)
building
facility
inspection
.
ahera
(
