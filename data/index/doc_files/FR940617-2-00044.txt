supplementary
information
:
on
04/22/1994
,
the
committee
for
purchase
from
people
who
are
blind
or
severely
disabled
published
notice
(
59
fr
.
19164
)
of
proposed
addition
to
the
procurement
list
.
comments
were
received
from
the
current
contractor
for
the
applicator
in
response
to
a
request
for
sales
data
.
the
contractor
indicated
that
it
is
near
a
labor
surplus
area
that
is
home
to
most
of
its
workers
and
that
it
is
experiencing
less
demand
than
it
can
supply
.
the
contractor
indicated
that
most
of
its
workers
are
the
sole
support
for
their
families
.
consequently
,
the
contractor
believes
that
addition
of
the
applicator
to
the
procurement
list
would
have
a
severe
adverse
impact
on
the
company
.
the
proportion
of
the
contractors
sales
which
it
would
lose
if
it
were
unable
to
sell
this
applicator
to
the
government
is
very
small
.
it
was
not
the
current
contractor
for
another
item
mentioned
in
its
comments
at
the
time
the
item
was
added
to
the
procurement
list
.
consequently
,
the
loss
of
sales
would
not
constitute
severe
adverse
impact
on
the
company
.
as
the
contractor
admitted
,
it
is
not
located
in
a
labor
surplus
area
even
though
some
of
its
workers
live
in
one
.
the
contractor
also
did
not
state
that
workers
would
be
discharged
if
the
applicator
is
added
to
the
procurement
list
.
because
these
workers
live
near
an
area
which
is
not
considered
a
labor
surplus
area
,
they
may
well
secure
other
employment
if
they
are
discharged
.
people
with
severe
disabilities
,
on
the
other
hand
,
have
unemployment
rates
exceeding
65
%
nationally
.
like
the
contractors
workers
,
people
with
severe
disabilities
are
often
the
sole
support
for
their
families
.
consequently
,
the
committee
believes
that
the
definite
creation
of
jobs
for
people
with
severe
disabilities
by
addition
of
the
applicator
to
the
procurement
list
outweighs
the
possible
loss
of
employment
for
people
who
can
more
easily
find
other
jobs
.
after
consideration
of
the
material
presented
to
it
concerning
capability
of
qualified
nonprofit
agencies
to
provide
the
commodity
,
fair
market
price
,
and
impact
of
the
addition
on
the
current
or
most
recent
contractors
,
the
committee
has
determined
that
the
commodity
listed
below
is
suitable
for
procurement
by
the
federal
government
under
41
usc
.
4648c
and
41
cfr
5124
.
i
certify
that
the
following
action
will
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
.
the
major
factors
considered
for
this
certification
were
:
1
.
the
action
will
not
result
in
any
additional
reporting
,
recordkeeping
or
other
compliance
requirements
for
small
entities
other
than
the
small
organizations
that
will
furnish
the
commodity
to
the
government
.
2
.
the
action
does
not
appear
to
have
a
severe
economic
impact
on
current
contractors
for
the
commodity
.
3
.
the
action
will
result
in
authorizing
small
entities
to
furnish
the
commodity
to
the
government
.
4
.
there
are
no
known
regulatory
alternatives
which
would
accomplish
the
objectives
of
the
javitswagneroday
javits
wagner
oday
act
(
41
usc
.
4648c
)
in
connection
with
the
commodity
proposed
for
addition
to
the
procurement
list
.
accordingly
,
the
following
commodity
is
hereby
added
to
the
procurement
list
:
applicator
,
disposable
6515/00/0595235
this
action
does
not
affect

contracts
awarded
prior
to

date
of

addition
or

contracts
