(

sets
out
four
prohibitions
for
all

prohibiting

added

and

one
prohibiting

expanded
to

to
all
attempts
to

not

as
in
the
1986
standard
,
to
reach
the
pel
.
osha
finds
these
changes
will
help
reduce
employee
exposures
and
are
consistent
with
the
revisions
to
the
standards
.
controls
for
asbestos
jobs
according
to
their
classification
the
next
set
of
requirements
in
the
`
methods
of
compliance
'
beginning
at
paragraphg4
,
are
keyed
to
the
four
classes
of
construction
activities
,
class
i
through
iv
,
relating
to
previously
installed
acm
and
pacm
,
defined
in
paragraph
(

.
the
scheme
is

with
class
i
as
the
most
hazardous

and

iv

class

of
the
`
removal

of

asbestos
containing
tsi
and
surfacing
material
and
of
pacm
,
including
demolition
operations
involving
these

.

consists
of
the
`
removal
'
of
all
other
asbestoscontaining
asbestos

materials
,
including
resilient

presumed
to

class

of
the

of
all
previously
installed

class
iv

consists
of

custodial
work
in
contact
with
previously
installed
acm
and
pacm
,
and
the
cleanup
clean
of
debris
on
construction
sites
.
all
asbestos
work
under
the
construction
and
shipbuilding
standards
is
not
in
the
`
class
system
'
the
installation
of
new
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
products
does
not
carry
a
class
designation
,
and
thus
the
classspecific
class
specific
requirements
do
not
apply
to
that
activity
.
work
covered
by
the
general
industry
standard
is
not
included
in
the
`
class
system
'
as
well
.
osha
also
notes
that
the
differences
in
controls
required
among
classes
is
not
great
.
further
,
the
agency
believes
that
the
risk
overlap
between
adjoining
classes
is
neither
frequent
nor
large
,
and
that
the
standard
allows
the
employer
flexibility
in
most
such
cases
.
the
regulation
requires
jobbyjob
job
by
job
evaluation
of
regulated
projects
,
and
gives
the
competent
person
some
leeway
in
easing
some
requirements
when
it
appears
that
the
project
can
be
done
especially
safely
.
the
following
examples
illustrate
how
operations
involving
potential
asbestos
disturbance
are
to
be
classified
.
if
an
insulated
pipe
is
leaking
,
and
less
than
one
standard
glove
bags
worth
of
tsi
is
`
disturbed
'
(
see
definition
in
paragraph
b
)
in
order
to
repair
the
leak
,
it
is
a
category
iii
job
.
if
the
tsi
is
stripped
from
a
section
of
piping
to
inspect
all
the
piping
in
an
area
for
leaks
,
it
is
a
class
i
job
.
if
the
section
of
piping
required
to
be
stripped
is
less
than
25
feet
,
it
is
still
a
class
i
job
,
but
critical
barriers
may
not
be
required
if
the
initial
exposure
assessment
is
`
negative
'
[
see
(
g4ib
.
if
it
is
not
clear
which
category
the
work
belongs
,
the
employer
should
assume
the
higher
,
more
restrictive
,
category
applies
,
and
should
comply
with
the
listed
work
practices
and
controls
for
that
category
.
osha
believes
that
most
asbestos
work
will
fit
easily
into
the
categories
which
are
defined
.
osha
found
that
the
term
`
smallscale
small
scale
,
shortduration
short
duration
'
insufficient
to
distinguish
lower
risk
asbestos
operations
which
allow
exemptions
from
generally
required
controls
.
a
historical
perspective
is
useful
to
clarify
this
issue
.
in
1986
,
osha
required
that
all
removal
,
renovation
,
and
demolition
operations
,
except
for
`
smallscale
small
scale
,
short
duration
'
operations
,
be
conducted
within
negative
pressure
enclosures
[
29
cfr
1926
58
.
the
scope
of
both
the
requirement
and
the
exemption
was
unclear
.
the
requirement
did
not
explicitly
apply
to
`
maintenance
or
repair
'
operations
,
though
most
of
the
examples
given
were
in
that
category
.
the
examples
cited
in
the
exemption
included
pipe
repair
,
valve
replacement
,
installing
electrical
conduits
,
installing
or
removing
drywall
,
roofing
,
and
other
general
building
maintenance
operations
.
in
addition
,
osha
maintained
that
it
was
not
possible
to
specify
with
precision
the
exact
size
of
a
`
smallscale
small
scale
'
maintenance
job
or
to
pinpoint
the
time
involved
in
a
`
shortduration
short
duration
'
task
.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
osha
had
not
drawn
the
parameters
of
the
exemption
with
enough
specificity
and
that
`
the
exception
as
now
worded
seems
to
erase
the
rule
'
as
noted
above
the
court
remanded
the
issue
to
osha
to
`
clarify
the
exemption
for
`
small
scale
,
short
duration
operations
'
from
the
negativepressure
negative
pressure
enclosure
requirements
.
further
the
court
suggested
that
osha
limit
the
exemption
to
`
work
operations
where
it
is
impractical
to
construct
an
enclosure
because
of
the
configuration
of
the
work
environment
'
stated
by
osha
in
the
preamble
to
the
1986
rule
,
as
the
intended
scope
of
the
exemption
