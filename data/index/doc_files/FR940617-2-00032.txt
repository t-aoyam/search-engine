this

is
a

supersedes
that
document
in
its
entirety
.
this
revision
provides
a
substantial

of
the
basic
phigs
functionality
known
as
plus

,
phigs

phigs

adds
facilities
for
the
specification
of
curved

,
curved
and
facetted
surfaces
,
lighting
and

,
and
adds
a

required
by

.
also
,
each
language

of
phigs
has
been
amended
as
a

of

.
the
specifications
and
amendments
that
comprise
the
complete
phigs
standard
as
a
result
of
this
revision
are
detailed
in
the
specification
section
of
this
document
.
in
addition
this
revision
adds
a
requirement
for
validation
of
phigs
implementations
using
either
fortran
or
c
bindings
.
however
,
validation
is
currently
limited
to
basic
phigs
functionality
,
and
therefore
does
not
include
the
new
functionality
of
phigs

added
by
this

as
a
federal
information

standard
(
fips
.
this
standard
specifies
the
control
and
data
interchange
between
an
application
program
and
its
graphic
support
system
.
it
provides
a
set
of
functions
and
programming
language
bindings
for
the
definition
,
display
and
modification
of
twodimensional
two

(
2d
)
or
threedimensional
three

(
3d
)
graphical
data
.
in
addition
,
these
language
bindings
allow
for
the
definition
,
display
and
modification
of
geometrically
related
objects
,
graphical
data
,
and
the
relationships
between
the
graphical
data
.
the
purpose
of
the
standard
is
to
promote
portability
of
graphics
application
programs
between
different
installations
.
the
standard
is
for
use
by
implementors
as
the
reference
authority
in
developing
graphics
software
systems
;
and
by
other
computer
professionals
who
need
to
know
the
precise
syntactic
and
semantic
