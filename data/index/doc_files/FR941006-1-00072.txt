that

would
not

the
new
provision

sampling

disgorgement
the
commission
has
a
statutory
obligation
to
complete
the
audits
of
publicly
funded
committees
in
a
thorough
and
timely
manner
.
in
the
past
,
the
resources
required
to
conduct
reviews
of
the
contributions
received
by
presidential
committees
contributed
to
the
commissions
difficulty
in
fulfilling
that
obligation
.
beginning
with
the
1992
election
cycle
,
however
,
the
commission
began
to
make
more
extensive
use
of
statistical
sampling
for
audits
of
contributions
received
by
publicly
financed
presidential
primary
election
committees
,
and
to
use
the
sample
results
to
quantify
,
in
whole
or
in
part
,
the
dollar
value
of
any
related
audit
findings
.
while
the
commission
continues
to
conduct
a
limited
nonsample
sample
review
of
contributions
received
by
these
committees
,
most
audit
testing
of
contributions
and
supporting
documentation
is
now
done
on
a
sample
basis
.
the
commission
is
now
proposing
that
new
paragraph
(
f
)
be
added
to
11
cfr
90071
and
90381
to
incorporate
these
procedures
.
the
commission
notes
that
this
approach
would
apply
in
a
general
election
only
to
contributions
raised
due
to
a
deficiency
in
the
presidential
election
campaign
fund
,
or
to
contributions
raised
by
new
or
minor
party
candidates

in

,
probability

,
is
widely
accepted
in

this
plan
is
discussed
in
the
american
institute

guide
entitled
audit
sampling
,
and
is
the

supported
by
the

software
package
idea
,
which
is
marketed
by
the
american

this

technique
has
been
used
by
the
commission
since
1980
to
determine
the
amount
of

'
matching
