,
propiconazole
has
been
the
subject
of
five
peer
reviews
and
one
scientific
advisory
panel
(
sap
)
meeting
.
propiconazole
was
originally
evaluated
by
the
peer
review
committee
on
01/15/1987
,
and
classified
as
a
group

(

recommendation
made
for
the
quantification
of
estimated
potential
human

the
peer
review
committees
decision
was
presented
to
the
fifra
scientific
advisory
panel
on
03/02/1988
.
the
panel
did
not
concur
with
the
committees
overall
assessment
of
the
weightofevidence
weight
of
evidence
on
the
carcinogenicity
of
propiconazole
.
the
panel
recommended
placing
the
chemical
in
group
d
,
indicating
that
the
group
c
classification
was
based
on
minimal
evidence
.
the
panels
determination
that
epas
group
c
classification
was
based
on
minimal
evidence
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
incidence
of
liver
tumors
in
male
mice
only
occurred
when
the
mice
were
given
an
excessive
chemical
dose
.
in
the
second
,
third
,
and
fourth
peer
reviews
that
followed
,
the
peer
review
committee
considered
recommendations
of
the
sap
as
well
as
rebuttals
by
the
registrant
.
its
conclusion
,
however
,
that
propiconazole
should
be
classified
as
a
group
c
carcinogen
with
a
quantification
of
potential
human
risk
remained
unchanged
.
as
part
of
a
fifth
peer
review
,
epa
considered
additional
information
provided
by
the
registrant
in
support
of
the
registrants
argument
that
the
high
dose
was
excessively
toxic
in
the
mouse
carcinogenicity
study
.
it
further
argued
that
the
data
from
the
high
dose
(
2500
ppm
)
should
not
be
included
in
the
evaluation
of
carcinogenic
potential
of
propiconazole
.
in
support
of
these
arguments
,
the
registrant
provided
two
subchronic
oral
toxicity
studies
in
mice
.
cibageigy
ciba
geigy
also
provided
a
reread
of
the
pathology
slides
from
a
mouse
oncogenicity
study
which
it
felt
indicated
sufficient
concurrent
liver
toxicity
at
2500
ppm
to
document
that
this
dose
was
excessive
.
these
findings
were
not
present
in
the
original
pathology
report
.
owing
to
the
inconsistency
in
cibageigys
ciba
geigys
report
and
the
original
report
,
the
agency
requested
that
an
independent
(
third
)
evaluation
of
the
pathology
slides
be
made
to
determine
if
the
pathology
reported
could
be
confirmed
.
the
results
of
this
(
third
)
pathology
evaluation
were
used
in
the
fifth
peer
review
in
place
of
data
resulting
from
the
earlier
evaluations
provided
by
cibageigy

.
in

conducted
with
acceptable

,
no
excessive
numbers
of
tumors
were
found
.
the
peer
review
committee
determined
,
based
on
the
additional
information
submitted
by
cibageigy
ciba
geigy
from
two
90day
day
subchronic
studies
in
mice
that
the
2500ppm

dose
used
in
the
2year
year
chronic
study
exceeded
the
maximum
tolerated

(

)
based
on
the
endpoint
of
hepatic
necrosis
,
and
the
500ppm
ppm
dose
used
in
the
chronic
study
was
inadequate
to
assess
the
carcinogenicity
of
propiconazole
.
based
on
the
third
pathology
evaluation
of
the
chronic
study
,
the
peer
review
committee
agreed
with
cibageigys
ciba
geigys
argument
that
the
study
showed
excessive
toxicity
at
the
2500
ppmdose
ppm
dose
and
concluded
that
the
90day
day
subchronic
studies
are
a
better
measure
of
what
would
be
an
mtd
.
based
upon
these
findings
,
the
peer
review
committee
agreed
that
the
classification
for
propiconazole
should
remain
a
group
c
(
possible
human
)
carcinogen
and
recommended
against
the
previously
used

)
for
risk
assessment
purposes
.
for
the
purpose
of
risk
characterization
the
peer
review
committee
recommended
that
the
reference
dose
(
rfd
)
approach
should
be
used
for
quantification
of
human
risk
.
this
decision
was
based
on
the
disqualification
of
the
high
dose
(
2500
ppm
,
making
the
data
inappropriate
for
the
calculation
of
q
.
.
because
the
middle
dose
(
500
ppm
)
was
not
considered
sufficiently
high
enough
for
assessing
the
carcinogenetic
potential
of
propiconazole
,
epa
has
requested
an
additional
mouse
study
at
intermediate
dose
levels
in
male
mice
only
.
epa
does
not
expect
that
these
data
will
significantly
change
the
above
cancer
assessment
that
propiconazole
poses
a
negligible
cancer
risk
to
humans
.
the

(

an

the

from

the

evaluated

and
the
commodities
which
have
established

using

.
the
livestock
burden
was
calculated
using
anticipated
residues
in
feed
items
multiplied
by
the
expected

contribution
to
the
diet
.
this
dietary
burden
was
then
compared
with

to
determine

the

useful

for
which
the

for
the
reasons
