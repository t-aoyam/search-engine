and
its

should
the
rapid

rule
be
rescinded
,
the
brokered
deposit
and
prompt
corrective
action
regulations
will
be
the
principal
means
by
which
rapid
growth
will
be
regulated
.
for
this
reason
,
in
deciding
whether
to
rescind
the
rapid
growth
rule
,
the
fdic
examined
the
rationale
and
history
behind
all
three
regulations
,
to
see
if
the
fdics
safetyandsoundness
safety
and

concerns
will
be
met
even
if
the
rapid
growth
rule
is
rescinded
.
the
rapid
growth
rule
,
adopted
in
1990
,
replaced
a
regulation
that
called
for
the
reporting
of
fully
insured
brokered
deposits
and
fully
insured
deposits
placed
directly
by
other
depository
institutions
.
in
the
preamble
to
the
proposed
rapid
growth
rule
,
the
fdic
stated
that
its
intention
was
to
broaden
the
prior
regulations
focus
from
brokered
deposits
to
all
kinds
of
rapid
growth
,
including
brokered
deposits
:
since
a
bank
may
obtain
its
funding
from
a
variety
of
sources
in
addition
to
brokered
deposits
,
the
fdic
believes
that
any
effort
to
monitor
and
control
rapid
growth
in
insured
banks
should
not
focus
solely
or
even
principally
on
brokered
deposits
.
instead
,
the
focus
should
be
on
rapid
growth
per
se
as
an
indication
of
the
need
for
close
monitoring
and
supervisory
oversight
.

the
proposed
rapid
growth
rule
stated
that
:
an
insured
bank
may
not
undertake
any
special
funding
plan
or
arrangement
designed
to
increase
its
assets
by
more
than
nine
percent
during
any
consecutive
threemonth
three
month
period
without
first
notifying
the
appropriate
fdic
regional
director
for
supervision
in
writing
at
least
30
days
in
advance
of
the
implementation
of
the
special
funding
plan
or
arrangement
.
for
purposes
of
this
requirement
,
a
special
funding
plan
or
arrangement
is
any
effort
to
rapidly
increase
the
assets
of
the
bank
by
any
means
.
id
.
at
13695
.
the
final
rule
changed
the
nine
percent
to
75
percent
,
making
the
rule
more
stringent
in
that
respect
,
but
it
narrowed
the
scope
of
the
rule
by
making
the
notice
necessary
only
if
there
was
75
percent
growth
resulting
from
one
or
more
of
the
following
activities
:
(
1
)
the
solicitation
and
acceptance
of
fully
insured
deposits
obtained
from
or
through
the
mediation
of
brokers
or
affiliates
(
that
is
,
insured
brokered
deposits
;
(
2
)
the
solicitation
of
fully
insured
deposits
outside
a
banks
normal
trade
area
(
this
category
would
include
insured
brokered
deposits
;
or
(
3
)
secured
borrowings
,
including
repurchase
agreements
.
thus
,
while
it
is
not
the
sole
aim
of
the
rapid
growth
rule
to
curb
the
rapid
growth
that
may
result
from
the
acceptance
of
brokered
deposits
,
controlling
a
banks
acceptance
of
brokered
deposits
is
one
of
the
primary
aims
of
that
rule
.
