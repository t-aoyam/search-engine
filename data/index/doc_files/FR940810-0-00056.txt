there
were
relatively
few
comments
received
on
this
issue
.
some
felt
that
asbestos
in
soil
resulted
in
negligible
exposures
and
that
wetting
to
prevent
fugitive
emissions
during
earth
moving
would
be
sufficient
control
(
eg
,
ex

.
another
participant
said
there
was
a
lack
of
control
technology
and
called
for
further
study
to
determine
the
extent
and
location
of
problems
(

.
the
industrial
hygienists
who
had
raised
the
issue
of
worker
exposure
to
naturally
occurring
asbestos
,
described
the
occurrence
of
asbestos
in
the
soil
of
fairfax
county
,
virginia
(
ex
.
7143
.
they
reported
that
water
misting
during
disturbance
of
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
soils
was
effective
in
controlling
exposures
.
they
recommended
the
use
of
negative
pressure
air
purifying
respirators
,
protective
clothing
and
showers
to
control
exposures
.
osha
finds
that
the
record
indicates
that
certain
construction
sites
in
mostly
welldefined
well
defined
areas
contain
deposits
of
naturally
occurring
asbestos
.
in
such
areas
,
airborne
asbestos
during
earthmoving
activities
may
result
in
significant
exposures
.
in
such
cases
,
wetting
of
the
excavation
site
,
often
required
by
local
authorities
,
should
be
sufficient
to
suppress
measurable
airborne
asbestos
concentrations
.
information
regarding
the
presence
of
asbestos
in
the
vicinity
of
construction
sites
may
be
available
from
state
environmental
agencies
,
the
united
states
geological
survey
,
and
the
bureau
of
mines

in
the
absence
of
information

is
readily
available
showing
asbestos
contamination
of
soil

immediate

osha
sought
information
and
comment
on
how
best
to
provide

protection
to

the

noted
that
although
it
had
considered
these
operations
to
be
regulated
under
the
general
industry
standard
in
the
1986
rulemaking
,
subsequent
considerations
led
osha
to
observe
that
many
shipyard

activities
are
constructionlike
construction

in
nature

in
response

sesac
drafted
alternative

text

it
submitted
to

with
the
recommendation
that
it
be
adopted

additional
comment
and
testimony
on
this
issue
was
submitted
during
the
rulemaking
.
for
example
,
charles
sledge
,
jr
.
of
the
norfolk
naval
shipyard
in
his
testimony
stated
that
he
did
not
feel
that
shipyard
industry
work
meets
the
definition
of
construction
work
defined
in
29
cfr
1910
12
(
ex
.
28
.
although
he
preferred
keeping
shipyard
industry
operations
under
the
general
industry
asbestos
standard
,
he
recommended
that
osha
apply
the
sesacrecommended
sesac
recommended
standard
to
shipyard
activities
rather
than
the
construction
asbestos
standard
.
he
pointed
out
that
most
asbestos
work
in
shipyards
takes
place
in
fixed
locations
and
does
not
have
the
transient
nature
of
true
construction
work
.
mr
.
sledge
also
felt
that
shipyards
have
developed
ways
to
stay
below
the
pel
and
that
any
change
would
result
in
requiring
expensive
alterations
of
facilities
,
and
a
need
for
additional
training
.
