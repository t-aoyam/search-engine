regulatory
amendments
`
basic
and
more
advanced

master
'
implies
that
,
for
chapter

purposes
,
lower
standards
may
be
established
for
all
children
.
the
secretary
believes
it
is
essential
that
chapter
1
participants
as
well
as
other
children
be
taught
challenging
subject
matter
and
assessed
to
determine
whether
that
subject
matter

comment
:
one
commenter
asked
whether
an
lea
could
be
granted
an
exception
to
use
a
local
assessment
system
or
whether
an
exception
could
only
apply
to
a
state
assessment
system
.
the
commenter
believed
the
regulations
to
be
unclear
in
this
area
.
discussion
:
the
secretary
intends
that
an
sea
may
request
an
exception
either
for
a
state
assessment
system
that
supports
statewide
systemic
education
reform
efforts
or
for
an
individual
lea
that
has
a
local
assessment
system
that
supports
its
local
reform
efforts
.

sections

and
201

have
been
revised
to
clarify
that
an
sea
may
request
an
exception
for
an
lea
that
has
an
assessment
system
that
supports
its
local
systemic
education
reform
efforts
and
meets
the
other
standards
in
the
regulations
.
comment
:
one
commenter
asked
whether
,
if
an
exception
is
granted
,
the
alternative
assessment
measures
may
be
used
for
determining
aggregate
performance
under
the
local
annual
review
for
program
improvement
as
well
as
for
local
evaluation
.
discussion
:
if
an
exception
is
granted
,
the
alternative
assessment
measures
may
be
used
for
any
purposes
for
which
they
are
appropriate
.
changes
:
none

comment
:
one
commenter
suggested
that
the
definition
of
desired
outcomes
in
§
2006
be
changed
or
deleted
,
consistent
with
the
intent
of
the
nprm
.
the
commenter
objected
to
that
portion
of
the
definition
linking
desired
outcomes
to
aggregate
performance
and
,
thus
,
to
scores
on
normreferenced
norm
referenced
tests
.
the
commenter
also
contended
that
this
definition
will
frustrate
the
intent
of
these
final
regulations
because
leas
would
still
be
required
to
set
their
desired
outcomes
in
terms
of
scores
on
normreferenced
norm
referenced
tests
.
discussion
:
changing
the
definition
of
`
desired
outcomes
'
in
§
2006
is
outside
the
scope
of
this
rulemaking
.
to
make
the
changes
the
commenter
has
suggested
would
require
the
secretary
to
first
publish
an
additional
nprm
.
the
secretary
does
not
believe
,
however
,
that
this
definition
will
frustrate
the
intent
of
these
final
regulations
.
if
a
state
or
lea
is
granted
an
exception
to
the
current
national
evaluation
standards
,
the
alternative
assessment
may
be
used
for
any
appropriate
purposes
,
including
determining
aggregate
performance
.
thus
,
if
nationally
normed
tests
are
not
part
of
the
alternative
assessment
,
scores
on
those
tests
would
not
be
used
to
determine
aggregate
performance
or
to
define
desired
outcomes
.
changes
:
none
.
