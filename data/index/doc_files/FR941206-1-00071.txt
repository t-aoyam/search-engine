hap
storage
.
materials
containing
hap
are
often
stored
in
containers
that
are
left
open
,
allowing
the
volatile
hap
to
evaporate
and
be
emitted
through
room
ventilation
to
the
atmosphere
.
the
work
practice
work
group
agreed
that
a
straightforward
,
inexpensive
method
of
reducing
emissions
from
hap
storage
would
be
to
cover
all
containers
storing
finishing
,
gluing
,
cleaning
,
and
washoff
materials
when
not
in
use
.
in
addition
to
reducing
hap
emissions
to
the
atmosphere
,
this
work
practice
has
the
added
benefit
of
reducing
worker
exposure
to
volatile
hap
.

hap
transfer
.
in
wood
furniture
finishing
,
gluing
,
and
cleaning
operations
,
solvent
,
finishing
material
,
and
adhesives
are
pumped
from
storage
containers
to
the
spray
gun
through
piping
.
in
wood
furniture
operations
,
leaks
can
occur
in
equipment
used
to
transfer
or
apply
finishing
materials
,
solvents
,
and
adhesives
.
therefore
,
the
work
group
agreed
that
requiring
sources
to
check
this
equipment
for
leaks
was
reasonable
.
to
implement
the
leak
inspection
program
,
sources
will
be
required
to
develop
an
iampm
plan
that
requires
the
inspection
of
each
piece
of
equipment
used
to
transfer
or
apply
finishing
materials
,
solvents
,
and
adhesives
;
a
schedule
for
inspection
;
reporting
of
the
results
of
the
inspection
,
any
repairs
that
were
made
to
the
equipment
,
and
the
timeframe
between
identifying
the
leak
and
performing
repairs
.
the
work
practice
work
group
agreed
upon
the
concept
of
an
iampm
plan
,
but
never
discussed
whether
the
proposed
rule
should
require
a
specific
inspection
frequency
and
,
if
so
,
what
the
frequency
should
be
.
in
establishing
the
regulatory
framework
for
the
negotiated
rule
,
the
agency
decided
that
a
monthly
inspection
frequency
is
appropriate
to
accomplish
the
goal
of
reducing
leaks
from
transfer
and
application
equipment
.
more
frequent
monitoring
was
considered
burdensome
because
smaller
shops
would
not
have
the
personnel
to
perform
the
inspections
.
to
ensure
that
action
would
be
taken
if
leaks
were
detected
,
the
proposed
rule
requires
that
repairs
be
made
within
15
calendar
days
,
with
a
first
attempt
at
repair
made
within
5
calendar
days
.
the
agencys
decision
is
supported
by
previous
regulatory
action
;
the
hazardous
organic
neshap
(
hon
)
and
the
neshap
for
coke
oven
batteries
both
require
this
same
repair
timeframe
.
as
stated
above
,
the
agency
used
the
committees
conceptual
agreement
for
an
iampm
plan
to
address
equipment
leaks
as
a
foundation
for
the
more
specific
provisions
in
the
proposed
rule
.
the
agency
requests
comment
on
the
specific
requirements
of
the
proposed
rule
,
and
data
to
suggest
that
more
or
less
frequent
monitoring
or
shorter
or
longer
repair
times
may
be
appropriate
.
iii
.
finishing
material
application
.
another
aspect
of
wood
furniture
finishing
operations
that
the
committee
evaluated
was
the
type
of
finishing
material
application
equipment
used
.
there
have
been
numerous
studies
comparing
the
transfer
efficiency
of
one
type
of
application
equipment
with
that
of
another
type
.
transfer
efficiency
is
the
ratio
of
the
amount
of
coating
solids
deposited
onto
the
surface
of
the
coated
part
to
the
total
amount
of
coating
solids
used
.
the
higher
the
transfer
efficiency
,
the
less
finishing
material
that
is
used
and
the
less
that
is
lost
as
overspray
(
sprayed
finishing
materials
that
miss
the
piece
.
overspray
eventually
dries
,
releasing
volatile
hap
,
and
becomes
a
solid
waste
source
for
the
facility
.
thus
,
by
increasing
transfer
efficiency
,
both
air
emissions
and
solid
waste
are
reduced
.
the
committee
agreed
that
highly
efficient
transfer
methods
are
desirable
.
traditionally
,
however
,
the
agencys
position
on
transfer
efficiency
has
been
one
that
advocates
the
use
of
more
efficient
transfer
methods
,
but
contends
that
emission
reductions
resulting
from
these
methods
can
not
be
quantified
.
for
the
purposes
of
the
proposed
rule
,
the
committee
reached
a
consensus
that
an
equipment
standard
rather
than
a
standard
that
identified
transfer
efficiencies
for
specific
application
methods
would
be
most
appropriate
.
the
committee
also
agreed
that
data
supporting
one
type
of
application
equipment
over
another
were
conflicting
except
in
one
instance
;
almost
all
data
suggest
that
conventional
air
guns
are
the
least
efficient
transfer
method
.
therefore
,
the
committee
proposed
that
the
rule
prohibit
the
use
of
conventional
air
spray
guns
.
