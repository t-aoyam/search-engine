supplementary
information
:
in
the
federal
register
of
03/30/1994
(

,
epa
issued
a
proposed
rule
that
gave
notice

to
petitions

formed
by

section
408
of
the
federal
food
,
drug
,
and
cosmetic
act
,
21
usc
.
346a
,
it
was
proposed
to
establish
tolerances
for
residues
of
the
herbicide
acetochlor
(
2chloro2methyl6ethyl
chloro
-
-
ethoxymethyl
acetanilide
)
and
its
metabolites
containing
the
ethyl
methyl
aniline
(
ema
)
moiety
and
the
hydroxyethyl
methyl
aniline
(
hema
)
moiety
,
to
be
analyzed
as
acetochlor
,
and
expressed
as
acetochlor
equivalents
,
in
or
on
the
raw
agricultural
commodities
(
racs
)
wheat
grain
at
0
02
ppm
and
sorghum
grain
at
0
02
ppm
.
there
were
no
comments
or
requests
for
referral
to
an
advisory
committee
received
in
response
to
the
proposed
rule
.
the
data
submitted
on
the
proposal
and
other
relevant
material
have
been
evaluated
and
discussed
in
the
proposed
rule
.
based
on
the
data
and
information
considered
,
the
agency
concludes
that
the
tolerances
will
protect
the
public
health
.
therefore
,
the
tolerances
are
established
as
set
forth
below
.
any
person
adversely
affected
by
this
regulation
may
,
within
30
days
after
publication
of
this
document
in
the
federal
register
,
file
written
objections
and
or
request
a
hearing
with
the
hearing
clerk
,
at
the
address
given
above
(

.
a
copy
of
the
objections
and
or
hearing
requests
filed
with
the
hearing
clerk
should
be
submitted
to
the
opp
docket
for
this
rulemaking
.
the
objections
submitted
must
specify
the
provisions
of
the
regulation
deemed
objectionable
and
the
grounds
for
the
objections
(
40
cfr

.
each
objection
must
be
accompanied
by
the
fee
prescribed
by
40
cfr

.
if
a
hearing
is
requested
,
the
objections
must
include
a
statement
of
the
factual
issues
)
on
which
a
hearing
is
requested
,
the
requestors
contentions
on
such
issues
,
and
a
summary
of
any
evidence
relied
upon
by
the
objector
(
40
cfr
178
27
.
a
request
for
a
hearing
will
be
granted
if
the
administrator
determines
that
the
material
submitted
shows
the
following
:
there
is
a
genuine
and
substantial
issue
of
fact
;
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
available
evidence
identified
by
the
requestor
would
,
if
established
,
resolve
one
or
more
of
such
issues
in
favor
of
the
requestor
,
taking
into
account
uncontested
claims
or
facts
to
the
contrary
;
and
resolution
of
the
factual
issues
)
in
the
manner
sought
by
the
requestor
would
be
adequate
to
justify
the
action
requested
(

.
under
executive
order
12866
(
58
fr

,
oct

4
,
1993
,
the
agency
must
determine
whether
the
regulatory
action
is
`
significant
'
and
therefore
subject
to
review
by
the
office
of
management
and
budget
(
omb

and
the
requirements
of
the
executive
order
.
under
section
3f
,
the
order
defines
a
`
significant
regulatory
action
'
as
an
action
that
is
likely
to
result
in
a
rule
(

)
having
an
annual
effect
on
the
economy
of
$
100
million
or
more
,
or
adversely
and
materially
affecting
a
sector
of
the
economy

productivity

competition

the
environment

public
health

or

(

creating
serious
inconsistency

otherwise
interfering

an

taken

materially
altering
the
budgetary

issues
arising

principles

forth
in
this
executive
order

pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
executive
order
,
epa
has
determined
that
this
rule
is
not
`
significant
'

is

not
subject

review

,
the
administrator
has
determined
that
regulations
establishing
new
tolerances
or
raising
tolerance
levels
or
establishing
exemptions
from
tolerance
requirements
do
not
have
a
significant
economic
impact

of

a

to
this
