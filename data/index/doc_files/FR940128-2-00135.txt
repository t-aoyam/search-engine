schaefer
correctly
concedes
that
the
district
courts
remand
order
in
this
case
was
entered
pursuant
to
sentence
four
.
he
argues
,
however
,
that
a
district
court
proceeding
under
that
provision
need
not
enter
a
judgment
at
the
time
of
remand
,
but
may
postpone
it
and
retain
jurisdiction
pending
completion
of
the
administrative
proceedings
.
that
argument
,
however
,
is
inconsistent
with
the
plain
language
of
sentence
four
,
which
authorizes
a
district
court
to
enter
a
judgment
`
with
or
without
'
a
remand
order
,
not
a
remand
order
`
with

without
'
a
judgment
