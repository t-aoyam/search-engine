fsis
wishes
to
receive
comments
on
whether
specific
handling

than

appropriate
for

in

,
in
order
to
avoid
confusion
about
the
parts
or
physical
state
of

that
may
be
processed
into

,
fsis
is
considering
providing
a
definition
of
`
poultry
carcasses
or
parts
of
carcasses
'
the
terms
`
poultry
carcasses
'
or
`
parts

would
apply
to
whole

of

in

the

,

,

,
mature

,
and

of

have
been
removed
and
such
poultry
is
free
from
protruding
pinfeathers
and
vestigial
feathers
and
suitable
for
cooking
without
need
of
further
processing
.
fsis
is
considering
that
adoption
of
the
handling
requirements
discussed
above
would
eliminate
the
need
to
require
that
the
temperature
of

or

in
which
equipment
for

of
raw
poultry
is
operated
be
maintained
at

thus
,
if
the
requirements

considering
are
adopted

fsis
would

tentative
position
:
limitations
on
use
.
fsiss
tentative
position
is
to
establish
and
codify
limitations
with
respect
to
use
of
mdp
in
the
formulation
of
poultry
and
meat
food
products
.
fsis
is
contemplating
imposing
such
restrictions
based
on
the
potential
fluoride
contribution
of
mdp
made
from
fowl
(
ie
,
mature
female
chickens
)
and
the
characteristics
of
mdp
,
including
the
kind
of
poultry
from
which
it
is
made
,
its
consistency
,
and
its
protein
and
fat
contents
.
fsis
believes
that
such
requirements
are
necessary
to
prevent
potential
health
and
safety
problems
,
and
to
maintain
the
quality
and
integrity
of
the
poultry
and
meat
food
product
supply
.
(

)
tentative
position
:
kind
of
product
limitation
.
fsis
is
considering
that
when
a
poultry
product
is
required
to
be
prepared
from
a
particular
kind
or
kinds
of
poultry
(
eg
,
chickens
,
use
of
mdp
of
any
other
kind
(
eg
,
mechanically
deboned
turkey
)
should
not
be
permitted
.
this
provision
would
assure
that
mdp
made
from
a
different
kind
of
poultry
is
not
used
in
a
poultry
product
represented
as
containing
ingredients
from
a
particular
kind
or
kinds
of
poultry
.
the
tentative
definition
and
standard
for
mdp
that
fsis
is
considering
covers
mdp
prepared
from
any
kind
of
poultry
.
fsis
is
not
considering
,
however
,
to
permit
use
of
mdp
as
an
ingredient
in
any
given
poultry
product
regardless
of
the
kind
of
poultry
from
which
it
is
made
.
such
action
would
be
inconsistent
with
existing
regulatory
requirements
and
interpretations
and
could
,
among
other
things
,
result
in
false
or
misleading
labeling
.
for
example
,
the
definition
and
standard
for
(
kind
)
patties
(
9
cfr
381
160
)
requires
that
poultry
product
ingredients
be
`
of
the
kind
indicated
'
(
eg
,
turkey
products
in
turkey
patties
.
fsis
believes
that
in
considering
to
amend
the
poultry
products
inspection
regulations
to
provide
for
the
use
of
mdp
as
a
distinctive
poultry
product
ingredient
,
this
consideration
should
not
abrogate
this
type
of
requirement
(
eg
,
to
permit
use
of
mechanically
deboned
chicken
in
turkey
patties
.
