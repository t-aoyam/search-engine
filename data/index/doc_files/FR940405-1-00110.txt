consequently
,
in
order
to
reflect
the
degree
to
which
establishments
will
provide
separate
smoking
areas
,
osha
developed
some
estimates
based
on
the
characteristics
of
the
stock
of
buildings
and
the
percentage
of
companies
currently
banning
smoking
in
the
workplace
.
osha
has
no
data
on
the
number
of
establishments
currently
permitting
smoking
in
designated
smoking
areas
.
osha
estimated
that
50
percent
of
large
establishments
with
floor
space
greater
than
100000
square
feet
and
with
more
than
three
floors
will
provide
designated
smoking
areas
.
osha
also
assumed
that
50
percent
of
all
eating
and
drinking
places
and
hotels
and
other
lodging
places
may
provide
separate
designated
smoking
areas
.
for
these
establishments
,
osha
then
applied
the
percentage
of
companies
that
will
ban
smoking
based
on
the
rates
provided
from
a
survey
conducted
by
the
administrative
management
society
foundation
(
ams
)
on
current
practices
for
smoking
policies
in
the
workplace
.
according
to
the
survey
,
25
percent
of
the
companies
completely
ban
smoking
on
their
premises
.
however
,
the
percentages
varied
by

as

firms
opting
to
make
available
designated
smoking
areas
are
expected
to
incur
initial

osha
assumed
that
in
many
cases
existing
rooms
or
offices
can
be
converted
into
a
designated

average
cost
estimates
for
retrofitting
the
hvac
system
ranges
from
$
4000
for
a
150
square
feet
room
(
which
could
accommodate
up
to
10
smokers
)
[

to
$

for
1000
square
feet
(
which
could
accommodate
30
to
65
smokers
)
[
ex
.
3643
.
the
hvac
retrofit
represented
in
these
estimates
typically
includes
:
(

)
blocking
off
the
return
air
inlet
from
the
room
,
(

)
providing
a
transfer
air
path
,
and
(
3
)
providing
an
exhaust
fan
and
exhaust
air
pathway
to
the
outside
.
the
exhaust
fan
capacity
would
exceed
air
supplied
to
the
room
in
sufficient
quantity
to
create
a
negative
pressure
in
the
smoking
room
relative
to
surrounding
areas
to
ensure
containment
of
the
contaminant
.
in
order
to
achieve
negative
pressure
some
architectural
modifications
may
be
necessary
to
provide
a
tight
enclosure
.
osha
did
not
estimate
an
additional
cost
for
housekeeping
since
such
activities
would
have
been
performed
prior
to
the
promulgation
of
the
proposed
standard
.

.
the
amount
of
exhaust

from

is
inconsequential
compared
with
the
quantities
of
air
leaving
the
building

therefore
,
osha
did
