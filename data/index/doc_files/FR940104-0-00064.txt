as

,
population
risk
is
lower
than
that
presented
in
the
proposal
for
both
fish
shellfish
consumption
and
the
soil
ingestion
pathway
,
due
to
a
unit
conversion
error
in
expressing
dioxin
concentration
.
the
dioxin
concentrations
in
the
formulation
at
one
of
the
affected
facilities
(
aquasco
,
md
)
were
reported
using
incorrect
units
,
causing
a
1000fold
fold
error
to
be
incorporated
into
the
risk
estimates
for
the
fish
and
shellfish
ingestion
and
soil
ingestion
scenarios
.
when
this
error
was
corrected
,
the
tcddteq
tcdd
teq
levels
used
as
the
source
concentration
for
affected
facilities
(
crosscontamination
cross
contamination
from
past
use
of
chlorophenolic
formulations
)
and
used
in
the
lifetime
individual
risk
estimates
for
the
soil
fish
and
shellfish
ingestion
scenarios
also
were
reduced
1000fold
fold
.
the
incremental
population
risk
was
revised
for
the
groundwater
ground
water
scenario
from
an
original
0
005
value
to
between
0
007
and
0
02
cancer
cases
.
this
range
of
0
007
to
0
02
cancer
cases
was
obtained
because
two
different
modelling
scenarios
were
run
to
generate
the
extremes
of
this
range
.
one
model
run
used
input
parameters
which
would
simulate
decay
for
a
small
production
plant
.
the
input
information
was
obtained
from
a
mass
balance
iteration
which
showed
that
it
would
take
a
small
plant
approximately
6
years
to
decrease
crosscontamination
cross
contamination
levels
to
near
zero
;
likewise
,
the
second
model
used
input
parameters
for
large
facilities
which
predicted
a
two
year
decline
to
near
zero
levels
of
crosscontamination
cross
contamination
.
the
details
of
the
mass
balance
approach
and
the
resulting
change
in
population
risk
can
be
found
in
the
background
document
for
this
final
rule
.
the
agency
believes
that
these
revised
risk
levels
do
not
warrant
a
hazardous
waste
listing
.
based
on
the
above
two
main
factors
(
(
ie
.
(
1
)
chlorophenolic
production
stoppage
and
subsequent
chlorophenolic
use
decline
and
(
2
)
revised
risk
due
to
cross
contamination
,
the
agency
looked
closely
at
any
potential
environmental
benefits
that
may
accrue
from
a
hazardous
waste
listing
.
given
the
market
trend
,
the
agency
cannot
identify
any
tangible
benefits
to
be
gained
from
listing
wastes
generated
from
the
use
of
chlorophenolic
formulations
for
wood
surface
protection
.
environmental
damages
caused
by
previous
use
of
chlorophenolics
have
already
occurred
.
a
listing
of
these
wastes
cannot
mitigate
past
damages
nor
can
it
force
the
cleanup
clean
of
these
damages
.
such
potential
jurisdiction
exists
under
current
programs
.
authority
under
cercla
and
rcra
3007
exists
even
if
a
decision
is
made
not
to
list
as
is
the
case
for
this
final
rule
.
damage
to
the
environment
of
this
magnitude
from
previous
use
of
chlorophenolic
formulations
within
this
industry
are
not
expected
to
occur
in
the
future
unless
use
of
fullstrength
full
strength
chlorophenolics
resumes
.
furthermore
,
sampling
data
collected
at
surface
protection
sites
indicate
that
dioxin
concentrations
in
storage
yards
(
the
largest
area
of
a
plant
)
are
below
1
ppb
.
the
heavier
contamination
that
occurs
in
the
process
area
is
confined
to
a
small
area
and
likely
will
not
migrate
offsite
off
site
to
environmental
receptors
.
therefore
,
the
agency
finds
that
the
risks
posed
by
this
residual
contamination
are
limited
and
that
a
hazardous
waste
listing
would
likely
simply
result
in
these
limited
areas
of
contamination
being
left
in
place
and
not
produce
an
environmental
benefit
.
thus
the
effect
on
past
contamination
does
not
justify
a
hazardous
waste
listing
.
b
.
operating
requirements
for
surface
protection
plants
because
the
agency
is
not
listing
f033
wastes
,
the
operating
standards
for
surface
protection
plants
proposed
in
the
04/27/1993
notice
are
not
applicable
and
,
thus
,
are
not
being
finalized
.
furthermore
,
surface
protection
plants
are
not
required
to
follow
any
specific
waste
management
requirements
regarding
previous
use
of
chlorophenolics
as
a
result
of
this
rule
.

although
this

does
not
list

from

as

,
the
agency
believes
that
certain

'
in

,
epa
proposed
to
add
six
hazardous
constituents
of
concern
found
in
surface
protection
wastes
to
appendix

of
40
cfr
part

.
based
on
the
information
gathered
during
this
listing
investigation
,
the
following
four
are
being
added
to
the
list
:
sodium
pentachlorophenate
,
potassium
pentachlorophenate
,
the
sodium
salt
of
2346tetrachlorophenol
tetrachlorophenol
,
and
the
potassium
salt
of
2346tetrachlorophenol
tetrachlorophenol
.
the
agency
presented
information
in
the
proposed
rule
and
supporting
background
documents
on
the
adverse
effects
of
these
compounds
.
for
those
reasons
,
epa
is
finalizing
the
addition
of
four
of
these
constituents
to
appendix
viii
of

.
the
agency
is
not
at
this
time
finalizing
the
addition
of
ocdd
and
ocdf
to

as
mentioned
before
,
the

of

reported
in
