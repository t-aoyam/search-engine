osha
also
noted
that

the
entire

in

the
respiratory

needs
dictated

the

'
osha
has
concluded
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
highest
level
of
respiratory
protection
must
be
used
.
these
are
class
i
jobs
for
which
a
negative
exposure
assessment
(
ie

will
be
less
than

)
has
not
been
made
.
inexperienced
workers
removing
large
amounts
of
tsi
or

acm
are
at
the
high
end
of
the
risk
spectrum
and
must
have
additional
protection
afforded
by
the
supplied
air
respirator
.
osha
notes
that
joint
epaniosh
epa
niosh
recommendations
would
require
a
supplied
air
respirator
in
even
more
extensive
circumstances
,
ie
,
all
`
abatement
'
work
and
maintenance
and
some
repair
work

the
agencys
decision
balances
the
acknowledge
potential
safety
hazards
of
supplied
air
respirators
with
the
need
for
more
protection
in
the
most
risky
asbestos
jobs
.
the
court
of
appeals
has
agreed
that
such
judgments
are
properly
within
the
discretion
of
the
agency
(

in
situations
where
the
competent
person
makes
a
determination
that
exposures
in
class
i
jobs
will
be
less
than
the
pels
,
the
standard
requires
that
a
halfmask
half
mask
air
purifying
,
nondisposable
disposable
respirator
equipped
with
a
high
efficiency
filter
must
be
used
.
there
are
two
reasons
for
this
requirement
:
exposures
less
than
the
pel
have
been
determined
to
result
in
significant
risk
,
the
record
shows
that
class
i
work
may
result
in
substantial
exposures
even
when
good
conditions
exist
,
and
the
variability
usually
results
in
some
high
exposures
.
however
,
although
all
classes
of
asbestos
work
are
potentially
risky
,
osha
has
used
discretion
,
and
has
limited
the
supplied
air
respirator
provision
to
the
highest
risk
situations
,
class
i
work
where
it
cannot
be
predicted
that
exposures
will
not
exceed
the
pel
.
this
approach
does
not
leave
workers
doing
other
classes
of
work
unprotected

use

be

.
furthermore
,
osha
has
based
this
conclusion
on
the
demonstrated
variability
of
exposures
in
the
construction
industry

their
rationale

as
follows
:
the

because

a
better
