(

alleged
that
the

made
clerical
errors
in

calculations

respondent
argued
that
the

erroneously
applied
best
information
available
(

(

)
and

on
the
basis
that
the
cost
of

manufacturing
data
did
not
include
costs
associated
with

of

.
respondent
contends
that

were
fully
provided

database
under
the
field

,
which
represented
processing
charges
by
outside

or
by

as
the
subcontractor
.
respondent
further
states
that
the
department
accepted
this
submission
,
used
it
for
the
preliminary
determination
,
made
no
request
for
further
information
,
and
appears
to
have
agreed
in
the
final
determination
that
the
appropriate
information
regarding
these
sales
had
been
submitted
.
the
department
does
not
agree
that
this
is
a
clerical
error
.
the
department
required
detailed
cost
information
for
further
manufacturing
to
be
reported
on
the
e2
further
manufacturing
cost
database
.
respondent
failed
to
provide
this
detailed
cost
information
with
respect
to
products
further
manufactured
by
mac
on
the
e2
database
,
even
though
it
indicated
it
had
done
so
on
page

of
the
narrative
portion
of
its

submission
.
respondent
reported
detailed
costs
only
for
products

manufactured
by

.
specifically
,
in
its
clerical
error
allegation
,
respondent
indicated
that
the

manufactured
by

was
included
in
the
`

field
of
the

tape
and
that
the
department
used
this
for
the
preliminary
determination
.
first
,
we
agree
that
the
total
further
manufacturing
costs
for
mac
were
included
on
the
c1
us
.
sales
tape
.
however
,
at
the
final
determination
,
we
made
adjustments
to
certain
elements
of
the
further
manufacturing
costs
.
these
elements
were
only
included
on
the
e2
further
manufacturing
database
.
since
respondent
failed
to
provide
on
the
e2
database
those
cost
elements
for
the
products
further
manufactured
by
mac
,
the
department
could
not
adjust
the
further
manufacturing
costs
of
the
mac
products
.
consequently
,
we
also
could
not
use
the
costs
reported
on
the
c1
us
.
sales
tape
since
this
tape
included
only
total
costs
and
not
the
individual
costs
elements
that
we
needed
to
adjust
.
