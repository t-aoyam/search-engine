the
memorandum
recommending
certification
considered
and
responded
to
all
public
comments
received
on
the
proposed
certification
during
the
60day
day
comment
period
.
these
comments
and
responses
are
set
forth
here
for
reference
:
comment
:
both
of
the
negative
comments
received
centered
on
the
belief
that
,
if
the
weather
forecast
office
(
wfo
)
is
not
located
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
,
services
to
that
area
could
be
degraded
.
related
to
this
point
,
these
commentors
focussed
on
the
distance
of
the
move
and
argued
that
services
would
be
degraded
because
the
forecasters
would
not
be
able
to
`
see
'
the
conditions
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
.
response
:
first
of
all
,
these
comments
ignore
the
fact
that
this
wsfo
is
responsible
for
weather
services
to
all
of
northern
california
,
not
just
the
san
francisco
bay
area
.
the
nws
is
convinced
that
the
relocation
to
monterey
will
enhance
weather
forecasting
for
the
entire
northern
california
service
area
.
the
logical
conclusion
of
this
comment
is
that
each
wfo
must
be
located
in
close
proximity
to
the
population
center
of
its
particular
service
area
.
such
a
result
obviously
is
not
reasonable
.
furthermore
,
there
will
be
no
degradation
of
weather
services
to
the
san
francisco
bay
area
itself
.
the
services
are
dependant
on
a
variety
of
information
which
includes
surface
observations
,
weather
radars
,
upper
air
soundings
,
weather
satellite
data
,
spotter
networks
,
aircraft
reports
,
and
numerical
guidance
from
the
national
meteorological
center
.
the
collection
of
this
data
and
information
is
dependant
on
communications
,
not
the
exact
location
of
that
office
,
and
will
be
equally
available
to
the
monterey
office
as
it
was
in
redwood
city
.
one
commentors
concern
,
that
the
loss
of
personal
contact
between
nws
personnel
and
the
media
and
agencies
might
degrade
the
overall
quality
of
services
,
also
is
unfounded
.
the
commentor
is
correct
that
`
the
nws
depends
heavily
on
the
media
to
get
its
warnings
out
'
however
,
the
primary
means
by
which
nws
warnings
are
disseminated
is
by
telecommunications
systems
such
as
noaa
weather
wire
,
not
by
personal
contacts
.
the
commentor
claims
that
television
reporters
in
the
san
francisco
area
`
regularly
visit
and
report
from
the
office
in
redwood
city
during
weather
emergencies
,
and
that
appearances
on
camera
by
nws
forecasters
add
immediacy
to
developing
weather
stories
and
allow
the
public
to
receive
information
directly
from
the
source
'
there
are
network
television
affiliates
in
the
monterey
area
that
could
provide
on
camera
interviews
with
the
forecasting
staff
from
the
office
in
monterey
.
with
modern
day
telecommunications
,
these
interviews
can
easily
be
broadcast
over
television
stations
located
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
.
contact
with
cooperating
and
user
agencies
such
as
fema
and
emergency
managers
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
will
continue
even
if
the
wsfo
is
relocated
to
monterey
.
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
these
contacts
,
that
are
currently
done
facetoface
face
to
face
,
will
be
less
effective
in
the
future
if
they
are
done
mostly
via
telephone
,
as
is
done
now
for
users
in
the
wsfos
service
area
that
are
outside
the
immediate
san
francisco
bay
area
.
moreover
,
contact
with
cooperators
and
users
will
be
enhanced
by
the
addition
of
a
dedicated
warning
coordination
meteorologist
to
the
staff
at
monterey
.
comment
:
the
two
commentors
opposed
to
the
relocation
also
argued
that
,
if
the
wfo
is
not
located
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
,
services
would
be
degraded
because
of
the
climatological
differences
.
response
:
this
comment
is
related
to
that
above
but
requires
some
additional
elaboration
.
there
are
numerous
climatological
zones
located
in
central
and
northern
california
.
a
primary
goal
of
the
nws
modernization
is
to
enable
each
future
wfo
to
provide
consistent
weather
services
to
its
entire
area
of
responsibility
which
includes
the
numerous
climatological
regimes
.
to
accomplish
this
the
nws
will
employ
advanced
computers
which
will
greatly
improve
the
numerical
guidance
available
to
forecasters
.
advanced
weather
satellites
will
make
higher
resolution
imagery
available
allowing
forecasters
to
see
in
detail
what
is
occurring
over
their
area
of
responsibility
.
the
number
and
frequency
of
surface
observations
will
be
increased
through
the
deployment
of
asos
.
a
national
network
of
wsr88d
wsr
doppler
radars
is
already
halfway
completed
.
this
will
provide
forecasters
in
monterey
the
ability
to
view
the
atmosphere
in
more
detail
than
ever
before
possible
.
not
just
over
the
san
francisco
bay
area
,
but
over
all
of
northern
and
central
california
.
any
attempt
to
compare
services
as
they
exist
today
with
those
that
will
be
available
in
the
future
is
a
disservice
to
all
the
users
of
weather
services
in
northern
and
central
california
.
comment
:
the
two
commentors
opposed
to
the
relocation
believe
that
a
number
of
experienced
forecasters
will
elect
to
retire
instead
of
relocate
and
the
result
will
be
degradation
of
services
.
response
:
clearly
,
the
ability
of
the
nws
to
relocate
an
office
(
or
to
take
a
number
of
other
modernization
actions
)
cannot
be
contingent
upon
the
number
of
employees
that
happen
to
retire
during
the
process
.
planning
for
these
actions
begins
years
in
advance
whereas
the
actual
number
of
employees
who
will
retire
is
not
known
for
certain
until
the
day
the
move
takes
place
.
therefore
,
the
nws
has
to
be
prepared
to
deal
with
whatever
vacancies
occur
in
the
same
way
it
deals
with
vacancies
at
any
office
which
occur
all
the
time
,
when
employees
retire
or
transfer
to
other
jobs
.
in
this
situation
,
even
in
the
worst
case
scenario
,
a
loss
of
7
employees
,
the
potential
for
any
short
term
effects
is
negligible
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
office
will
retain
4
out
of
5
lead
forecasters
;
that
it
has
already
recruited
3
experienced
forecasters
and
has
identified
2
additional
experienced
forecasters
that
could
be
detailed
to
monterey
during
the
transition
;
and
that
the
office
will
be
able
to
field
experienced
personnel
on
each
shift
.
comment
:
three
commentors
stated
that
with
the
new
technologies
the
proposed
relocation
of
the
nws
forecast
office
would
not
degrade
services
that
,
in
fact
,
they
expect
an
enhancement
of
weather
services
.
two
of
the
commentors
stated
that
collocating
with
the
naval
post
graduate
school
would
be
beneficial
to
the
nws
and
create
new
opportunities
for
collaborative
research
activities
.
response
:
the
nws
agrees
.
improved
warning
and
forecast
capabilities
are
expected
to
result
from
this
collocation
.
improved
access
to
fleet
numerical
oceanography
center
data
sources
including
satellite
imagery
from
the
defense
meteorological
satellite
system
as
well
as
global
,
regional
,
and
wave
numerical
forecast
models
will
enable
improved
weather
services
.
comment
:
one
commentor
believed
that
the
relocation
would
be
more
costly
.
response
:
the
issue
of
cost
associated
with
the
office
move
is
not
relevant
to
certification
.
however
,
an
economic
analysis
(
ea
)
was
completed
on
05/20/1992
,
by
the
special
engineering
program
office
which
concluded
that
the
relocation
to
monterey
was
the
most
economical
.
in
07/19/1993
,
the
department
of
commerce
office
of
inspector
general
validated
that
ea
and
determined
the
monterey
location
to
be
the
most
economical
to
the
government
.
