according
to
petitioners
,
the
problems
that
the
department
discovered
during
verification
are
significant
and
pervasive
.

for
the
specific
issues
raised
by
petitioners
)
petitioners
contend
that
,
because
of
the
serious
nature
of
the
deficiencies
in
kts
cost
data
,
the
department
cannot
,
and
should
not
,
develop
an
alternative
basis
for
constructing
kts
production
costs
.
rather
,
petitioners
argue
that
the
department
should
resort
to
total
bia
.
in
selecting
the
bia
rate
,
petitioners
assert
that
the
department
should
use
the
highest
rate
possible
,
which
is
the
highest
margin
contained
in
the
petition
.
kt
argues
that
the
department
is
authorized
to
use
bia
if
a
party
`
refuses
or
is
unable
to
produce
information
requested
in
a
timely
manner
and
in
the
form
required
'
or
if
a
party
`
significantly
impedes
an
investigation
'
kt
asserts
that
,
in
order
for
these
conditions
to
be
satisfied
,
the
department
must
have
requested
the
information
and
the
respondent
must
have
either
failed
to
supply
the
information
or
have
been
unable
to
comply
with
the
request
.
furthermore
,
kt
argues
that
,
even
where
the
department
has
requested
information
,
it
is
not
authorized
to
use
bia
unless
it
has
provided
respondent
with
a
warning
and
an
opportunity
to
correct
any
deficiencies
.
kt
asserts
that
,
since
it
(

)
provided
all
of
the
information
requested
by
the
department
,
(

)
in
no
way
impeded
this
investigation
,
and
(

)
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
correct
perceived
deficiencies
,
there
is
no
basis
for
the
department
to
resort
to
any
form
of
bia
.
kt
claims
that
if
the
department
determines
that
it
is
appropriate
to
use
bia
for
purposes
of
the
final
determination
,
it
should
use
a
nonpunitive
punitive
,
partial
bia
,
to
reallocate
kts
fabrication
costs
.

according
to
kt
,
since
kt
has
fully
cooperated
with
the
department
throughout
this
investigation
,
there
is
no
reason
for
the
department
to
completely
disregard
kts

submission
.
doc
position
:
we
agree
with
kt
.
the
department
has
determined
that
kt
reported
the
majority
of
its
production
cost
with
no
material
problems
.
(
(

dated

because

there

comment

:
kt
contends
that
the
department
should
accept
the
material
costs
reported
in
its
09/13/1993
,
response
.
kt
argues
that
the
department
verified
that
kt
accurately
reported
in
this
response
its
actual
production
quantities
and
actual
material
costs
incurred
during
the
poi
.
according
to
kt
,
since
the
submitted
productspecific
product
specific
material
costs
are
the
result
of
actual
material
expenses
divided
by
actual
production
quantities
,
there
is
no
basis
for
suspecting
that
the
reported
per
unit
material
costs
are
incorrect
.
kt
also
maintains
that
its
calculation
of
steel
coil
costs
on
a
gradebygrade
grade
by
grade
basis
is
appropriate
because
the
cost
of
the
coil
did
not
vary
based
on
gauge
.
additionally
,
kt
maintains
that
,
contrary
to
petitioners
'
assertions
,
productspecific
product
specific
material
costs
reported
in
its
september
13
submission
are
different
from
productspecific
product
specific
material
costs
reported
in
its
october
25
submission
for
a
legitimate
reasonbecause
the
methodologies
used
in
each
submission
were
different
.
finally
,
kt
notes
that
although
the
weightedaverage
weighted
average
material
expenses
decreased
slightly
between
the
september
and
october
responses
,
the
percentage
of
the
five
most
frequently
sold
homemarket
home
market
products
that
were
sold
at
prices
below
the
cost
of
production
remained
exactly
the
same
,
regardless
of
which
responses
material
costs
are
used
.
thus
,
kt
maintains
that
the
difference
between
the
two
submissions
in
material
expenses
does
not
materially
affect
the
margin
calculation
.
according
to
petitioners
,
since
kt
did
not
submit
actual
costs
on
a
productspecific
product
specific
basis
,
acceptance
of
its
cost
data
would
be
improper
and
inconsistent
with
the
departments
normal
practice
.
thus
,
petitioners
contend
that
kts
cost
submission
should
be
rejected
.
