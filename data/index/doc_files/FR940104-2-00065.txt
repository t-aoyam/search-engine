the
licenses
provide
,
among
other
things
,
that
the
facility
is
subject
to
all
the
rules
,
regulations
,
and
orders
of

the
facility
employs
pressurized
water
reactors
(

)
located
at
the
licensees
site
in
louisa
county
,
virginia
.
the
licensee
is
implementing
a
refurbishment
and
restoration
program
for
the
na1amp2
service
water
system
(
sws
.
the
program
is
being
conducted
in
several
stages
.
the
subject
phase

,
stage

is
to
be
conducted
for
a
period
of
time
beginning
01/03/1994
and
ending
10/13/1994
,
and
will
be
performed
during
dual
unit
operating
conditions
.
the
scope
of
stage
4
involves
restoration
of
the
two
24inch
inch
auxiliary
supply
lines
from
lake
anna
to
the
main
sw
headers
.
this
consists
of
approximately
900
linear
feet
of
piping
(
450
feet
per
line
.
each
450foot
foot
line
consists
of
approximately
185
feet
of
direct
buried
piping
,
230
feet
of
concreteencased

piping
and
35
feet
of

.
to
support
the
phase

,
stage
4
sws
restoration
program
,
the
licensee
has
identified
one
temporary
exemption
required
at
this
time
.
the
exemption
is
specified
below

criterion
(
gdc2
gdc
)
requires
that
:
structures
,
systems
,
and
components
important
to
safety
shall
be
designed
to
withstand
the
effects
of
natural
phenomena

,
*
*
*
*
*

without
loss
of
capability
to
perform
their
safety
functions
.
the
licensee
has
requested
the
temporary
exemption
from
gdc2
gdc
because
of
planned
maintenance
which
will
expose
portions
of
the
sws
piping
to
the
potential
effects
of
postulated
missiles
generated
by
natural
phenomena
.
earth
and
concrete
protect
the
piping
systems
from
the
effects
of
severe
weather
events
at
the
na1amp2
site
,
such
as
tornadoes
,
for
conformance
with
the
requirements
of
gdc2
gdc
.
the
excavation
of
the
auxiliary
service
water
lines
will
affect
only
the
missile
shield
protection
aspects
of
gdc2
gdc
,
with
seismic
qualification
being
retained
.
while
producing
a
minimal
increase
in
missile
interaction
risk
,
excavation
of
the
piping
does
not
result
in
total
vulnerability
to
missiles
.
in
the
area
of
the
planned
excavation
,
the
lines
are
substantially
below
grade
and
are
adjacent
to
the
turbine
building
structure
.
this
will
prevent
some
lateral
aspects
of
missile
vulnerability
.
the
licensee
is
providing
contingency
measures
with
compensatory
actions
to
provide
added
assurance
of
safe
operation
of
the
facility
during
the
exemption
period
.
although
the
exemption
is
requested
only
for
missile
protection
,
the
risk
to
the
plant
due
to
construction
mishaps
is
more
significant
than
the
risk
due
to
natural
phenomena
.
therefore
,
the
compensatory
measures
are
geared
toward
preventing
such
mishaps
in
addition
to
minimizing
the
potential
for
missiles
generated
by
severe
weather
.
as
stated
in
the
staffs
safety
evaluation
dated
12/27/1993
,
these
compensatory
actions
include
but
are
not
limited
to
the
following
:
&
bullelectronic
scanning
and
nondestructive
locating
methods
will
be
used
to
accurately
determine
underground
locations
of
piping
,
duct
banks
,
and
other
buried
utilities
prior
to
excavation
.
&
bullmachine
excavation
will
be
limited
to
an
elevation
that
does
not
pose
a
threat
to
the
auxiliary
service
water
(
asw
)
lines
.
the
remaining
excavation
will
be
performed
by
hand
operated
power
and
manual
tools
.
&
bullphysical
barriers
will
be
used
to
keep
vehicles
a
safe
distance
from
the
excavation
site
.
&
bullloose
materials
in
and
around
the
excavation
will
be
limited
to
only
those
absolutely
necessary
for
activities
in
progress
.
&
bulllifting
and
rigging
components
will
be
inspected
and
load
tested
.
lifting
of
equipment
or

materials
over
the
excavation
will
be
performed
with
adequate
precautions
in

with
approved
procedures
.
&
bulldirect

(
using
