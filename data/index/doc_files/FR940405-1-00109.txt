osha
assumed
that
the
labor
costs
for
the
trainer
and
preparation
time
are
approximately
equal
to
25
percent
of
the
trainees
wage
cost
during

session
.
osha
also
assumed
that
50
percent
of
the
workers
will
require
such
training
.
the

:

the
number

is
based
on

occupational

statistics
survey
of

and
includes
all
maintenance
workers
who
perform
work
involving
two

,
or

table

,
presents
oshas
estimate
for
the
number
of
maintenance
workers
needing
training
and
the
associated
costs
.
the
annualized
first
year
cost
is
estimated
at
$
05
million
.
it
was
assumed
that
job
changes
within
establishments
or
buildings
will
require
retraining
.
the
annual
new
hire
cost
is
estimated
at
$
08
million
,
based
upon
industry
turnover
rates
.
thus
osha
estimated
annualized
cost
training
to
be
$
13
million
.
the
proposed
standard
requires
employers
to
inform
all
employees
of
the
contents
of
the
standard
and
its
appendices
.
this
could
be
accomplished
by
posting
the
proposed
standard
at
a
bulletin
board
;
therefore
,
osha
did
not
include
a
cost
for
this
provision
.
(
d
)
compliance
with
related
standards
.
the
proposed
standard
requires
employees
performing
work
on
hvac
systems
to
comply
with
several
existing
osha
standards
and
therefore
any
costs
associated
with
compliance
with
this
provision
have
already
been
considered
.
this
requirement
is
necessary
to
protect
employees
from
exposure
to
indoor
air
pollutants
and
exposure
to
noise
.
this
provision
is
considered
to
have
a
de
minimus
effect
on
all
industries
and
osha
believes
that
establishments
are
in
full
compliance
with
this
requirement
.

.
the
primary
objective
of
the
tobacco
smoke
provision
is
to
eliminate
the
nonsmokers
exposure
to
ets
.
under
the
proposed
rule
,
firms
will
have
the
option
of
either
banning
smoking
of
tobacco
products
or
permitting
smoking
only
in
designated
areas
.
osha
recognizes
that
not
all
establishments
will
make
available
designated
smoking
areas
as
there
may
be
physical
constraints
on
the
option
of
providing
separate
ventilation
.
such
constraints
are
imposed
by
the
buildings
design
,
the
buildings
mechanical
ventilation
systems
capabilities
,
by
costs
involved
in
providing
adequate
ventilation
,
by
the
occupant

of
the

.
in
some
cases
,
establishments
located
in
severe
climate
zones
may
find
it
necessary
to
protect
their
smoking
employees
from
weather
exposure
by
providing
designated
smoking
areas
