.
regulatory
background
the
proposed
rule
represents
the
epas
first
comprehensive
regulation
of
the
wood
furniture
(
surface
coating
)
category
.
no
federal
rules
,
such
as
new
source
performance
standards
(
nsps
,
have
previously
been
promulgated
for
this
industry
.
in
1990
,
the
clean
air
act
was
amended
;
two
titles
of
the
1990
amendments
affect
wood
furniture
manufacturers
,
prompting
regulation
of
this
industry
.
title
iii
of
the
clean
air
act
amendments
of
1990
was
enacted
to
help
reduce
the
increasing
levels
of
nationwide
air
toxics
emissions
.
under
title
iii
,
section
112
of
the
act
was
amended
to
give
the
epa
the
authority
to
establish
national
standards
to
reduce
air
toxics
from
sources
that
emit
such
pollutants
.
section
112b
)
contains
a
list
of
the
hap
that
are
the
specific
air
toxics
to
be
regulated
by
national
emission
standards
for
hazardous
air
pollutants
(
neshap
.
section
112c
)
directs
the
epa
to
use
this
pollutant
list
to
develop
and
publish
a
list
of
source
categories
(
industries
)
for
which
neshap
will
be
developed
.
this
list
of
source
categories
was
published
in
the
federal
register
on
07/16/1992
(
57
fr
31576
)
and
includes
a
category
for
major
sources
entitled
wood
furniture
(
surface
coating
.
therefore
,
the
proposed
standards
regulate
emissions
of
hap
from
new
and
existing
wood
furniture
(
surface
coating
)
operations
located
at
major
sources
.
a
major
source
of
hap
emissions
is
one
that
emits
or
has
the
potential
to
emit
,
considering
controls
,
greater
than
91
megagrams
per
year
(
mg
yr
)
(
10
tons
per
year
[
tons
yr
)
of
any
one
hap
or
227
mg
yr
(
25
tons
yr
)
of
multiple
hap
.
the
control
of
hap
is
to
be
achieved
through
promulgation
of
emission
standards
under
sections
112d
)
and
112f
)
and
design
,
equipment
,
work
practice
,
or
operational
standards
under
section
112h
)
for
categories
of
sources
that
emit
hap
.
the
epa
began
the
wood
furniture
neshap
development
process
(
described
in
section
v
of
this
preamble
)
in
11/19/1990
.
during
the
information
gathering
stage
,
the
epa
surveyed
more
than
850
facilities
in
the
wood
furniture
industry
in
order
to
assess
the
many
differences
in
operations
and
potential
control
techniques
across
the
industry
.
