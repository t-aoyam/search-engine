the
initial
and
continuous
compliance
methods
for
sources
using
control
devices
are
identified
in
§
63
804
)
and
(
f6
)
and
(
g4
)
and
(
g6
)
of
the
proposed
rule
and
are
generally
consistent
with
previous
regulations
developed
by
the
agency
.
therefore
,
the
rationale
for
selection
of
these
requirements
is
not
discussed
in
great
detail
here
.
for
example
,
the
proposed
rule
requires
the
same
type
of
monitoring
parameters
for
a
source
using
a
thermal
incinerator
as
those
required
by
§
63
114
of
the
hon
(
57
fr
62608
.
a
source
must
determine
the
hap
emission
rate
using
epa
reference
method
18
,
and
during
the
test
set
the
minimum
combustion
temperature
that
corresponds
to
compliance
with
the
standards
.
subsequent
operation
at
a
combustion
temperature
lower
than
this
value
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
rule
.
special
compliance
provisions
have
been
included
for
catalytic
incinerators
equipped
with
a
fluidized
bed
and
for
carbon
adsorbers
.
the
compliance
provisions
for
catalytic
incinerators
equipped
with
a
fluidized
bed
are
consistent
with
those
currently
in
use
by
the
only
facility
in
the
source
category
equipped
with
such
a
device
.
these
provisions
have
proven
successful
in
demonstrating
compliance
for
this
facility
,
so
epa
has
agreed
to
adopt
these
provisions
for
this
category
.
however
,
they
should
not
be
adopted
as
compliance
measures
by
other
source
categories
without
a
thorough
evaluation
.
in
this
proposed
rule
,
compliance
monitoring
is
identified
only
for
incinerators
and
carbon
adsorbers
because
other
types
of
control
devices
are
not
likely
to
be
used
for
compliance
.
if
an
alternate
control
device
is
used
by
an
affected
source
,
the
rule
includes
provisions
for
proposing
appropriate
compliance
monitoring
to
the
administrator
.
the
proposed
rule
also
recognizes
that
the
overall
control
efficiency
of
a
control
system
does
not
depend
only
on
the
destruction
efficiency
of
the
device
but
on
the
capture
efficiency
as
well
.
the
capture
efficiency
is
the
ratio
of
the
quantity
of
pollutants
entering
the
control
device
to
the
quantity
of
pollutants
emitted
from
the
emission
source
.
the
overall
control
efficiency
is
the
product
of
the
capture
and
control
efficiency
.
the
proposed
rule
identifies
the
methods
to
be
used
to
determine
the
capture
efficiency
initially
,
and
the
monitoring
required
to
demonstrate
that
this
efficiency
is
continuously
maintained
.
the
provisions
contained
in
the
proposed
rule
are
the
same
as
those
in
the
neshap
for
the
magnetic
tape
industry
(
59
fr
11662
,
which
was
proposed
on
03/11/1994
.
owners
or
operators
of
a
source
to
which
the
capture
efficiency
provisions
apply
are
encouraged
to
review
the
magnetic
tape
preamble
and
rule
to
understand
the
rationale
for
selecting
the
capture
efficiency
provisions
.
as
previously
stated
,
most
affected
sources
are
expected
to
comply
with
the
proposed
rule
by
using
compliant
materials
.
initial
and
ongoing
on
going
compliance
for
these
sources
are
demonstrated
through
reporting
and
recordkeeping
requirements
.
