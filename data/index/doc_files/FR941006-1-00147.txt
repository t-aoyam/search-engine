analysis
of
impacts
fda
has
examined
the
impacts
of
the
proposed
rule
under
executive
order
12866
and
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
(

l

executive
order
12866
directs
agencies
to
assess
all
costs
and
benefits
of
available
regulatory
alternatives
and
,
when
regulation
is
necessary
,
to
select
regulatory
approaches
that
maximize
net
benefits
(
including
potential
economic
,
environmental
,
public
health
and
safety
,
and
other
advantages
;
distributive
impacts
;
and
equity
.
the
agency
believes
that
this
proposed
rule
is
consistent
with
the
regulatory
philosophy
and
principles
identified
in
the
executive
order
.
in
addition
,
the
proposed
rule
is
not
a
significant
regulatory
action
as
defined
by
the
executive
order
and
so
is
not
subject
to
review
under
the
executive
order

description
of
the
industry
there
are
approximately
300
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
that
may
be
affected
by
these
proposed
actions
,
of
which
approximately
onehalf
one
half
contain
30
mg
or
more
iron
per
dosage
unit
.
the
types
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
that
have
been
associated
with
poisonings
of
young
children
are
products
offered
in
solid
oral
dosage
form
as
multivitamin/mineral
vitamin/mineral
supplements
,
products
intended
for
use
as
iron
supplements
,
and
drug
products
.
typically
,
multivitamin/mineral
vitamin/mineral
supplements
provide
less
than
30
mg
of
iron
per
dosage
unit
.
iron
supplements
and
drug
products
typically
contain
30
mg
or
more
iron
per
dosage
unit
.
the
proposed
action
to
require
warning
statements
would
affect
all
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
on
the
other
hand
,
fda
is
proposing
to
require
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
for
products
containing
30
mg
or
more
iron
per
dosage
unit
.
therefore
,
most
multivitamin/mineral
vitamin/mineral
supplements
would
be
subject
to
the
warning
statement
requirements
but
not
to
the
packaging
requirements
.
most
iron
supplements
and
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drug
products
would
be
subject
to
both
proposed
requirements
.
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
may
be
purchased
by
consumers
on
their
own
initiative
as
dietary
supplements
,
or
they
may
be
prescribed
by
physicians
.
the
information
available
to
the
industry
suggests
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
iron
-
containing
products
are
currently
packaged
in
bottles
(
ref
.
33
.
additional
information
suggests
that
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
administered
in
hospitals
are
commonly
packaged
in
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
(
ref
.
34
.
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
is
preferred
by
hospitals
because
with
this
type
of
packaging
,
each
dosage
unit
has
an
identification
and
an
expiration
date
,
and
the
hospital
can
continue
to
use
unitdose
unit
dose
packaged
drugs
rather
than
having
to
discard
a
bottle
opened
for
a
specific
patient
after
that
patient
is
discharged
.
based
on
this
information
,
fda
assumes
that
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
dispensed
in
hospitals
are
currently
packaged
in
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
.
according
to
the
national
center
for
health
statistics
,
of
the
approximately
169
million
persons
of
age
18
or
older
,
197
percent
consume
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
(
ref
.
35
.
if
it
is
assumed
that
each
individual
consumes
one
dosage
unit
per
daythere
are
approximately
12
billion
dosage
units
of
iron
-
containing
products
consumed
annually
in
the
united
states
.
the
agency
does
not
have
complete
information
on
the
number
of
dosage
units
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
that
contain
30
mg
or
more
iron
.
however
,
because
only
pregnant
women
require
30
mg
day
,
fda
assumes
that
the
portion
of
higherdosage
higher
dosage
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
can
be
estimated
by
the
number
of
pregnant
women
in
the
united
states
.
in
1991
,
the
most
recent
year
for
which
data
are
available
,
there
were
41
million
live
births
(
ref
.
36
.
fda
is
assuming
a
onetoone
one
to
one
correspondence
between
the
number
of
live
births
and
the
number
of
pregnancies
in
concluding
that
there
are
about
41
million
pregnant
women
on
any
one
day
in
the
united
states
.
the
number
of
live
births
may
overestimate
the
number
of
pregnant
women
because
multiple
births
by
one
woman
are
ignored
.
also
,
the
number
of
live
births
ignores
pregnancies
not
resulting
in
a
live
birth
,
which
may
result
in
an
underestimate
of
the
number
of
pregnant
women
.
if
it
is
assumed
that
the
number
of
live
births
is
an
estimate
of
the
number
of
dosage
units
of
products
containing
30
mg
or
more
iron
,
then
the
number
of
dosage
units
per
year
can
be
estimated
at
41
million
times
365
days
per
year
or
about
15
billion
.
