federal
assistance
regulations
,
the
proposal
entitled
`
phase
2
plan
for
the
utility
photovoltaic
group
'
submitted
by
upvg
.
doe
recommends
that
the
proposal
for
work
continuation
be
accepted
for
support
without
further
competition
in
accordance
with
§

.
the
project
extension
will
be
performed
in
ten
tasks
,
with
emphasis
toward
outreach
to
educate
utility
and
other
audiences
and
toward
building
a
foundation
for
accelerated
utility
pv
purchase
commitments
.
the
overall
upvg
objective
is
the
establishment
of
an
accelerated
market
for
pv
systems
that
allows
reduced
pv
costs
through
economy
of
scale
.
the
program
is
intended
to
develop
and
disseminate
pv
information
for
utilities
,
prompt
utility
purchases
,
and
develop
a
foundation
for
a
multiyear
year
pv
hardware
initiative
.
the
programmatic
evaluation
[

completed
for
this
proposal
resulted
in
a
recommendation
to
fund
this
grant
application
for
the
following
reasons
:
a
.
overall
merit
and
relevance
to
the
doe
mission
doe
is
actively
pursuing
a
program
towards
solar
energy
conversion
,
with
a
major
program
objective
being
the
costeffective
cost
effective
use
of
photovoltaics
(
pv
)
in
utility
applications
.
the
upvg
activities
directly
support
the
doe
objectives
by
involving
a
large
group
of
member
electric
utilities
in
the
nearterm

implementation
of
largescale

pv
systems
.
the
upvg
represents
an
ideal
and
totally
unique
mechanism
to
encourage
the
use
of
pv
through
doe
financial
support
of
the
large
,
unified
group
of
interested
utilities
.
b
.
anticipated
objectives
and
probability
of
success
in
meeting
them
the
proposed
activities
continue
a
multiyear
year
program
at
upvg
intended
to
result
in
the
achievement
of
pv
acceptance
and
use
by
electric
utilities
.
the
program
involves
several
different
tasks
,
with
an
overall
objective
being
the
installation
of
50
mw
of
new
utility
pv
generation
capacity
within
5
years
.
the
current
upvg
program
includes
ten
overall
tasks
,
each
with
multiple
subtasks
.
the
ten
tasks
include
:
1
.
technology
transfer
and
member
development
.
2
.

.
3

market
for
pv
.
the
successful
implementation
of
this
project
would
