in
conclusion
,
there
are
multiple
pathways
by
which
ets
may
damage
the
heart
.
ets
exposure
has
been
demonstrated
to
both
increase
myocardial
oxygen
demand
and
decrease
myocardial
oxygen
supply
.
if
oxygen
demand
exceeds
supply
for
a
long
enough
period
of
time
,
then
myocardial
cell
injury
or
even
cell
death
can
occur
.
in
addition
,
ets
exposure
may
cause
platelets
to
become
less
sensitive
to
the
anticlotting
clotting
regulatory
substances
in
the
blood
and
therefore
increase
the
tendency
of
the
blood
to
clot
.
an
increased
tendency
for
the
blood
to
clot
may
lead
to
an
increased
susceptibility
to
heart
attacks
.
ets
exposure
may
also
contribute
to
the
chronic
formation
of
arterial
wall
plaques
which
are
implicated
in
the
event
of
an
acute
myocardial
infarction
.
the
two
mechanisms
described
by
which
ets
exposure
may
stimulate
plaque
formation
are
endothelial
cell
injury
and
increased
platelet
activation
.
different
people
will
have
different
abilities
to
deal
with
the
increased
stress
on
the
heart
and
the
increased
tendency
of
the
blood
to
clot
as
a
result
of
ets
exposure
.
for
example
,
a
young
,
otherwise
healthy
individual
may
be
able
to
tolerate
shortterm
short
term
ets
exposure
without
apparent
difficulty
,
although
asymptomatic
arterial
wall
injury
may
occur
which
can
contribute
to
cardiac
injury
in
the
future
.
however
,
an
older
person
with
preexisting
existing
coronary
artery
disease
and
therefore
minimum
cardiac
reserve
may
not
be
able
to
tolerate
shortterm
short
term
ets
exposure
,
due
to
the
increased
stress
on
the
heart

reproductive
effects
data
on
the
reproductive
effects
due
to
the
exposure
of
nonsmoking
pregnant
women
to
ets
has
been
presented
in
many
studies
[

4287
,
4299
.
this
is
important
since
many
nonsmoking
women
continue
to
work
throughout
their
pregnancies
.
pregnant
women
working
in
indoor
environments
without
tobacco
smoking
restrictions
,
as
in
restaurants
,
comprise
one
of
the
most
heavily
etsexposed
ets
exposed
groups
[

low
birthweight
has
also
been
shown
to
be
associated
with
paternal
smoking
,
implying
passive
exposure
to
tobacco
smoke
by
the
nonsmoking
mother
[
exs
.
492
,

.
passive
exposure
to
tobacco
smoke
is
estimated
to
double
the
risk
of
low
birthweight
in
a
fullterm
full
term
baby
[
ex
.
4208
.
nonsmoking
pregnant
women
who
are
exposed
to
ets
have
been
reported
to
deliver
neonates
that
range
24
to
120
grams
lighter
in
weight
than
those
babies
delivered
by
nonexposed
pregnant
women
[
exs

4132
,
4174
,
4208
,

this
relationship
between
passive
smoking
and
low
birthweight
remains
statistically
significant
even
after
accounting
for
mothers
age
,
parity
,
social
class
,
sex
of
baby
,
and
alcohol
consumption
.
this
effect
is
more
apparent
in
neonates
born
to
actively
smoking
women
who
deliver
babies
that
weigh
,
on
average
,
200
grams
less
than
those
of
nonsmoking
women
[

.
the
reduction
in
birthweight
is
clinically
significant
at
the
low
end
of
the
birthweight
distribution
.
these
infants
have
higher
perinatal
mortality
[
ex
.
4239
.
other
reproductive
effects
that
have
been
ascribed
to
maternal
ets
exposure
include
miscarriage
,
an
increase
in
congenital
abnormalities
[
exs

4239
,
4299
,
and
numerous
other
physiological
effects
[
ex

4297
.
it
was
reported
that
these
effects
may
be
part
of
a
general
immunosuppressive
condition
associated
with
the
occurrence
of
low
birthweight
[
ex
.
4299
.
this
effect
may
predispose
the
baby
to
respiratory
tract
infections
.
the
effects
of
environmental
smoke
exposure
on
the
fetus
may
have
longterm
long
term
sequelae
into
childhood
and
adulthood

there
is
limited
evidence
which
suggests
that
growth
retardation
observed
in
the
fetus
is
reflected
in
the
growing
child
as
reductions
in
lung
development
[

this
is
especially
relevant
if
that
child
continues
to
be
exposed
to
ets
throughout
childhood
and
into
adulthood

prenatal
exposure
to
ets
and
exposure
to

experimental
research
on
the
adverse
reproductive
effects
associated
with
ets
exposure
in
animals
is
limited
.
however
,
one
study
[

demonstrated
such
effects
.
sciatic
nerve
tissue
taken
from
the
offspring
of
etsexposed

exposed
female
mice
revealed
definite
toxic
effects
on
the
neonatal

at

blood

were
taken
and
carbon

were

ultrastructural

some

darkened
