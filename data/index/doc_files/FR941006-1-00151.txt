product
reformulationappearance
two
petitions
recommended
product
reformulation
as
a
preventive
measure
.
the
petitions
suggested
that
some
adult
formulations
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
look
and
taste
like
candy
and
thus
are
more
appealing
to
children
.
the
petitions
stated
that
if
the
product
were
less
appealing
to
children
,
the
incidence
of
accidental
ingestion
would
be
reduced
.
the
petition
from
ndma
urged
fda
to
reject
reformulation
for
several
reasons
,
including
a
lack
of
knowledge
about
what
a
pill
looks
like
to
a
very
young
child
,
and
about
why
the
child
is
motivated
to
consume
the
product
.
the
agency
does
not
have
information
to
determine
either
the
costs
or
the
benefits
of
reformulating
the
appearance
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
because
reformulation
costs
are
highly
dependent
on
the
individual
decisions
of
firms
,
they
are
very
difficult
to
estimate
.
also
,
because
there
are
currently
no
objective
measures
of
the
candylike
candy
like
appearance
of

,
the
benefits
are
also

product
reformulationtaste
another
possibility
is
to
add
a
bitter
substance
to
products
containing
iron
which
would
discourage
multiple
ingestions
.
such
substances
have
been
used
in
the
past
on
products
which
discourage
thumbsucking
and
nailbiting
.
it
is
highly
likely
that
such
a
substance
will
not
add
significantly
to
the
cost
of
producing
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
fda
requests
information
on
a
policy
option
that
would
require
altering
the
taste
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
such
information
would
include
the
potential
substances
that
would
make
the
pills

and
data
on
their
safety
and
whether
this
approach
would

in

of

notes
,
however
,
that
such
an
option
may
have
the
unintended
side
effect
of
causing
persons
who
need
