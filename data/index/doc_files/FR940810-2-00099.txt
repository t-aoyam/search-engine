system
exceeds
the
present
verification
methodologys
capability
to
discern
an
individuals
identity
.
unlike
the
photograph
identification
badge
,
hand
geometry
is
nontransferable
.
during
the
initial
access
authorization
or
registration
process
,
hand
measurements
are
recorded
and
the
template
is
stored
for
subsequent
use
in
the
identity
verification
process
required
for
entry
into
the
protected
area
.
authorized
individuals
insert
their
access
authorization
card
into
the
card
reader
and
the
biometrics
system
records
an
image
of
the
hand

.
the
unique

the
newly

are
then
compared
to
the

granted
based

the
degree
to
which
the

template
.
since
both
the
badge
and
hand
geometry
would
be
necessary
for
access
into
the

,
the
proposed

would
provide
for

process
.
potential
loss
of
a
badge
by
an
individual
,
as
a
result
of
taking
the
badge
offsite
,
would
not
enable
an
unauthorized
entry
into
protected
areas
.
the
access
process
will
continue
to
be
under
the
observation
of
security
personnel
.
the
system
of

coupled
with
their
associated
access

cards
will
continue
to
be
used
for
all
individuals
who
are
authorized

to

without

.
badges
will
continue
to
be
displayed
by
all
individuals
while
inside
the

.
addition
of
a

biometrics
system
will
provide
a
significant
contribution
to
effective

of
the
security

at

accordingly
,
the
commission
concludes
that
this
proposed
action
would
result
in
no
significant
radiological
environmental
impact
.
with
regard
to
potential
nonradiological
radiological
impacts
,
the
proposed
change
does
not
affect
nonradiological
radiological
plant
effluents
and
has
no
other
environmental
impact
.
therefore
,
the
commission
concludes
that
there
are
no
significant
nonradiological
radiological
environmental
impacts
associated
with
the
proposed
action
.

,
the

considered
denial
of
the

denial
of

would
result

the
environmental
impacts
of
the

finding
of
no

the

has
determined
not

based

the
