if
the
permitting
authority
and
owner

agree
that
there
are
solutions
,
the
owner

operator
must
develop
a
plan
to
reduce

of
the

the
extent
feasible

the
plan
must
address
the
approach
to

provide

the

uses
a

then
the

of

includes
a
list
of
all
vhap
of

.
if
the
affected
sources
use
of
the
vhap
of

exceeds
the

then
the

procedures
as
those
used

an

occurs
for
those

the
de

rates
for
the

are
based
on
the
principles
involved
and
some
of
the
supporting
data
used
for
the
proposed

and
are
briefly
described
here
.
for
the

)
rulemaking
,
the
basis
for
the
de

levels
is
the
use
of
information
that
is
available
to
determine
(

)
an
exposure
level
which
results
in
a
onepermillion
one
per
million
cancer
risk
level
,
or
(
2
)
an
exposure
level
which
constitutes
an
`
ample
margin
of
safety
'
level
for
noncancer
effects
.
the
risk
management
decisions
to
use
these
two
criteria
to
determine
de

emission
rates
are
fundamental
assumptions
in
the
determination
of
de
minimis
levels
for
the
section
112g
)
rulemaking
.
note
that
the
de
minimis
levels
do
not
take
into
account
any
additive
effects
which
may
result
from
exposure
to
multiple
pollutants
.
for
pollutants
where
insufficient
doseresponse
dose
response
information
is
available
to
determine
the
exposure
level
associated
with
either
a
onepermillion
one
per
million
cancer
risk
or
an
`
ample
margin
of
safety
'
for
noncancer
effects
,
the
proposed
rule
contains
default
values
which
reflect
risk
management
decisions
for
establishing
the
de
minimis
rates
.
an
important
risk
management
decision
for
establishing
de
minimis
levels
under
section
112g
)
was
to
`
cap
'
de
minimis
emission
rates
at
10
tons
per
year
.
for
example
,
if
an
exposure
level
associated
with
a
onepermillion
one
per
million
cancer
risk
results
in
a
de
minimis
level
greater
than
10
tons
,
the
de
minimis
level
,
by
virtue
of
the
cap
,
is
10
tons
.
the
epa
believes
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
support
the
designation
of
a
`
trivial
'
level
of
emissions
of
an
air
pollutant
that
is
considered
`
major
'
by
the
guiding
legislation
.
the
risk
management
process
for
establishing
de
minimis
values
for
the
proposed
rule
for
section
112g
)
gave
consideration
to
the
interim
nature
of
section
112g
)
requirements
.
for
carcinogens
with
available
unit
risk
estimates
,
the
duration
of
exposure
used
to
set
de
minimis
emission
rates
of
such
pollutants
is
the
same
as
the
estimated
period
the
section
112g
)
rulemaking
will
be
in
effect
before
those
provisions
are
augmented
by
the
section
112j
)
provision
.
at
that
time
,
sources
will
be
subject
to
casebycase
case
by
case
mact
determinations
or
the
national
mact
standards
will
have
been
promulgated
for
those
sources
.
because
the
wood
furniture
mact
standard
was
not
intended
to
be
interim
in
nature
,
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
specific
de
minimis
rates
listed
in
section
112g
)
are
not
intended
to
be
used
directly
by
the
wood
furniture
mact
standard
.
consequently
,
the
rates
need
to
be
adjusted
to
take
into
account
a
lifetime
duration
of
exposure
.
this
adjustment
would
affect
the
de
minimis
levels
for
pollutants
identified
as
nonthreshold
for
which
unit
risk
estimates
are
available
.
some
industry
members
of
the
committee
recommended
that
epa
request
comments
on
the
adjustment
of
the
proposed
section
112g
)
de
minimis
values
from
7year
year
exposure
to
70year
year
exposure
values
.
therefore
,
the
epa
is
requesting
comment
on
this
issue
.
