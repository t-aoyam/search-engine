pulmonary

much
of
the
literature
relevant
to
the
association
between
noncancerous
cancerous
health
effects
and
ets
has
focused
on
children
.
because
children
are
undergoing
development
and
maturation
,
they
are
not
physiologically
equivalent
to
adults
exposed
to
the
same
conditions
.
therefore
,
findings
in
studies
conducted
with
respect
to
ets
and
children
may
not
be
directly
applicable
to
adults
.
however
,
a
number
of
studies
have
investigated
the
relationship
between
ets
and
pulmonary
health
effects
in
adults
.
studies
which
are
restricted
to
adults
vary
by
numerous
factors
,
such
as
the
population
studied
,
the
measures
used
to
estimate
exposure
to
ets
,
and
the
physiologic
and
health
outcomes
examined
.
the
studies
also
varied
in
the
consideration
of
potential
confounders
.
a
number
of
studies
have
found
relationships
between
ets
exposure
and
pulmonary
health
effects
.
these
studies
have
:
(

)
used
pulmonary
function
tests
,
which
may
be
more
sensitive
than
methods
used
in
other
studies
,
to
detect
physiological
changes
occurring
in
the
small
airways
of
the
lungs
(
eg
,
forced
midexpiratory
mid
expiratory
flow
rate
(

)
,
and
forced
endexpiratory
end
expiratory
flow
rate
(
fef

)
;
(

)
studied
older
populations
with
a
longer
history
of
exposure
to
ets
;
(

)
stratified
the
level
of
ets
exposure
with
significant
findings
more
likely
to
occur
in
persons
with
higher
exposures
;
and
(

)
more
frequently
found
significant
changes
in
lung
function
in
men
,
although
adverse
pulmonary
effects
to
ets
have
also
been
shown
in
women
