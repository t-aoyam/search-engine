background
on
07/21/1992
,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
issued
its
opinion
in
tenneco
,
upholding
in
substantial
part
order
nos
.
497
and
497a
.
however
,
the
court
found
that
the
commission
did
not
adequately
justify
its
extension
of
the
contemporaneous
disclosure
requirement
of
§
1613f
)
to
gas
sales
and
marketing
information
.
the
court
stated
that
`
on
remand
the
commission
should
reconsider
its
justification
for
applying
[
the
contemporaneous
disclosure
requirement
of
§
1613f
]
to
sales
and
marketing
information
and
ensure
that
the
final
requirement
is
reasonably
tailored
to
meet
the
commissions
goals
of
improving
the
market
and
benefitting
consumers
,
as
well
as
preventing
undue
discrimination
'
in
a
related
matter
,
the
court
stated
that
`
applying
[
the
contemporaneous
disclosure
requirement
of
§
1613f
]
to
releasedgas
released
gas
information
prior
to
the
issuance
of
order
no
.
497a
might
well
be
fundamentally
unfair
'
and
that
the
commission
could
avoid
`
the
expense
of
litigation
over
this
issue
by
announcing
that
it
will
not
retroactively
apply
[
1613f
]
to
released
gas
information
'
further
,
in
its
review
of
ozark
,
the
court
found
that
the
commission
erred
in
finding
order
no
.
497
applicable
to
ozark
,
a
joint
venture
partnership
composed
of
subsidiaries
of
four
natural
gas
pipelines
,
each
of
which
has
a
25
percent
ownership
and
voting
interest
.
the
court
stated
that
the
commission
failed
to
consider
relevant
evidence
regarding
the
ability
of
the
owner
pipelines
with
affiliates
to
control
the
partnership
