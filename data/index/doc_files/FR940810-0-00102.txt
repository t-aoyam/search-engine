the
question
of
whether
a
negative
pressure
enclosure
should
be
required
for
floor
tile
removal
,
was
considered
during
the
rulemaking
.
some
participants
,
including
asbestos
abatement
consultant
,
marshall
marcus
recommended
negative
pressure
enclosures
as
a
matter
of
course
for
asbestos
containing
flooring
removal
(
see
eg
,
tr
.
3796
and
ex
.
737
,
792
.
osha
notes
that
its
final
rule
now
requires
bystander
protection
,
when
excessive
exposure
levels
are
measured
or
expected
.
the
questionable
benefits
to
flooring
removal
employees
of
working
within
a
enclosure
are
discussed
in
the
general
discussion
on
npes
in
this
preamble
.
osha
also
notes
that
some
exposure
data
submitted
concerning
flooring
removal
exposure
levels
,
contained
relatively
high
exposures
for
work
within
enclosures
(
see
eg
,
ex
.
7134a
)
and
that
removing
flooring
using
dry
ice
in
a
negative
pressure
enclosure
can
result
in
toxic
buildups
within
the
enclosure
(
see
tr
.
202
.
therefore
osha
is
not
generally
requiring
flooring
removal
to
be
done
within
npes
.
however
,
where
flooring
material
is
removed
using
`
aggressive
methods
'
higher
fiber
levels
have
been
reported
,
at
least
as
measured
by
tem
(
see
ex
11
,
22
and
918
.
the
agency
concludes
that
the
use
of
aggressive
floor
removal
techniques
in
which
the
material
is
not
removed
intact
,
such
as
mechanical
chipping
of
floor
tile
and
shotblast
shot
blast
removal
of
mastic
,
are
likely
to
result
in
the
release
of
larger
amounts
of
fibers
and
must
be
performed
within
negativepressure
negative
pressure
enclosures
or
the
equivalent
.
epa
has
concluded
similarly
:
removal
of
vat
(
or
other
known
or
assumed
acm
flooring
or
its
adhesive
)
which
involves
sanding
,
grinding
,
mechanical
chipping
,
drilling
,
cutting
or
abrading
the
material
has
a
high
probability
of
rendering
the
material
friable
and
capable
of
releasing
asbestos
fibers
.
therefore
,
removal
projects
which
employ
any
of
these
techniques
(
other
than
smallscaleshortduration
small
scale
short
duration
)
must
be
conducted
as
response
actions
,
including
use
of
a
project
designer
,
accredited
persons
,
and
air
clearance
(

.
in
response
to
concerns
that
the
rfci
work
practices
will
not
be
followed
,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
alternate
to
their
use
is
full
enclosure
of
the
operation
which
is
likely
to
be
considered
more
burdensome
than
the
work
practices
.
transite
removal
removal
of
transite
panels
is
considered
a
class
ii
activity
in
this
revised
standard
.
as
such
,
they
are
required
to
be
removed
using
certain
practices
and
controls
.
these
are
:
the
intact
removal
of
transite
panels
;
the
use
of
wet
methods
followed
by
wrapping
of
the
panels
in
plastic
;
and
the
lowering
of
panels
to
the
ground
without
breakage
.
these
provisions
are
in
essence
the
same
one
proposed
by
osha
in
1990
when
allowing
an
exemption
from
the
npe
requirements
.
the
1990
proposal
presented
the
comments
of
osha
field
personnel
which
suggested
that
removal
of
transite
panels
,
without
regard
to
quantity
,
should
be
exempt
from
the
negativepressure
negative
pressure
enclosure
requirement
as
long
as
the
transite
is
removed
without
cutting
or
otherwise
abrading
the
material
(

this
suggestion

additional
work
practices
such
as

were

in

are

in
