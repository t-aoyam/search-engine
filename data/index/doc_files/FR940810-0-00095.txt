stated
that
he
felt
that
the
device
`
provided
a
safe
and
cost
effective
alternative
to
standard
glove
bag
removal
'
the
last
method
specifically
listed
for
class
i
use
is
designated
the
`
water
spray
'
process
.
in
submissions
to
the
docket
and
in
testimony
at
the
public
hearing
,
representatives
of
hydrous
dust
control
systems
,
inc
.
described
an
alternate
method
of
control
for
use
in
work
on
asbestos
covered
pipes
which
they
called
the
portam
process
.
this
process
relies
on
water
spray
to
provide
a
barrier
between
the
worker
and
the
acm
.
in
written
materials
it
was
described
as
follows
:
engineered
designed
sprays
are
configured
so
as
to
create
a
liquid
barrier
on
every
plane
.
the
spray
is
so
designed
as
to
throw
a
heavy
droplet
of
liquid
giving
it
both
velocity
and
direction
.
on
at
least
one
of
these
planes
*
*
*
*
*
*
the
heavy
water
droplets
are
forced
into
collision
creating
a
very
fine
aerosol
which
is
contained
within
liquid
barriers
.
a
water
containment
device
is
placed
around
the
spray
rails
with
an
open
access
and
double
drain
facility
.
a
vacuum
hose
is
connected
to
the
drain
facility
creating
a
slight
pressure
differential
(
negative
pressure
,
in
the
contained
area
.
when
water
covers
the
drain
area
the
pressure
differential
is
maximized
in
the
drain
hose
pulling
the
waste
and
water
very
rapidly
to
the
remote
interceptor
.
this
movement
creates
a
shock
pulse
which
is
quite
visual
and
is
reflected
at
the
workhead
.
the
sudden
movement
of
air
within
the
work
zone
helps
to
stimulated
the
fine
aerosol
droplets
creating
eddy
current
.
these
eddy
currents

a

data
were
presented
showing
that
use
of
this
system
achieved
consistently
low
exposure
levels
.
however
,
the
complexity
of
the
system
,
and
its
uniqueness
require
,
as
the
manufacturer
recommends
,
additional
training
for
effective
use
.
therefore
osha
is
allowing
this
system
to
be
used
only
by
workers
who
are
trained
in
a
supplemental
40
hour
training
course
in
the
specific
use
of
this
system
,
including
at
least
8
hours
of
which
must
be
handson
hands
on
training
.
although
bctd
stated
that
this
system
possessed
a
high
potential
for
exposure
because
it
is
not
a
sealed
system
,
(
ex

,
at

,
osha
believes
that
the
technology
of
the
water
spray
system
is
sufficiently
proven
by
the
data
submitted
.
