a
notice
of

was
not

for
this

good
cause
exists
for
making
it
effective
in
less

30
days
after

publication
.
publishing
an
nprm
and
delaying
its
effective
date
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
since
immediate
action
is
needed
to
prevent
potential
hazards
to
the
tugs
barbara
richard
foss
and
the
barge
and
other
vessels
that
may
transit
the
area
.
less
than
30
days
notice
was
given
to

by

thus
,
there
was
not
sufficient
time
to
publish
proposed

in
advance
of
the

to
provide
a

large
number
of
vessels
congregating
near
the
tugs

concern
is
justified
due
to
the
limited
maneuverability
of

the
mariners
who

during
their
transit
as
well
as

order

assessment

the

expects
the
economic
impact

be
so
minimal

evaluation

determined
that
the

not

sufficient
federalism
