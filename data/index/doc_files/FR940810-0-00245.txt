asbestos
is
used
by
the
construction
industry
in
such
products
as
shingles
,
floor
tiles
,
asbestos
cement
,
roofing
felts
,

acoustical

uses
include
brakes
,

facings
,
paper
,
paints
,
plastics
,
and
fabrics
.
one
of
the
most
significant
exposures
in
the
workplace
is
the
removal
and
encapsulation
of
asbestos
in
schools
,
public
buildings
,
and
homes
.
many
workers
have
the
potential
to
be
exposed
to
asbestos
during
these
operations
.
about
95
%
of
the
asbestos
in
commercial
use
in
the
united
states
is
chrysotile
.
crocidolite
and
amosite
make
up
most
of
the
remainder
.
anthophyllite
and
tremolite
or
actinolite
are
likely
to
be
encountered
as
contaminants
in
various
industrial
products

method
performanceprecision
and
accuracy
precision
is
dependent
upon
the
total
number
of
fibers
counted
and
the
uniformity
of
the
fiber
distribution
on
the
filter
.
a
general
rule
is
to
count
at
least
20
and
not
more
than
100
fields
.
the
count
is
discontinued
when
100
fibers
are
counted
,
provided
that
20
fields
have
already
been
counted
.
counting
more
than
100
fibers
results
in
only
a
small
gain
in
precision
.
as
the
total
count
drops
below
10
fibers
,
an
accelerated
loss
of
precision
is
noted
.
at
this
time
,
there
is
no
known
method
to
determine
the
absolute
accuracy
of
the
