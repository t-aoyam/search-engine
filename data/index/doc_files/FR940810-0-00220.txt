dispersion
staining
dispersion
microscopy
or
dispersion
staining
is
the
method
of
choice
for
the
identification
of
asbestos
in
bulk
materials
.
becke
line
analysis
is
used
by
some
laboratories
and
yields
the
same
results
as
does
dispersion
staining
for
asbestos
and
can
be
used
in
lieu
of
dispersion
staining
.
dispersion
staining
is
performed
on
the
same
platform
as
the
phasepolar
phase
polar
analysis
with
the
analyzer
and
compensator
removed
.
one
polarizing
element
remains
to
define
the
direction
of
the
light
so
that
the
different
indices
of
refraction
of
the
fibers
may
be
separately
determined
.
dispersion
microscopy
is
a
darkfield
dark
field
technique
when
used
for
asbestos
.
particles
are
imaged
with
scattered
light
.
light
which
is
unscattered
is
blocked
from
reaching
the
eye
either
by
the
back
field
image
mask
in
a
mccrone
objective
or
a
back
field
image
mask
in
the
phase
condenser
.
the
most
convenient
method
is
to
use
the
rotating
phase
condenser
to
move
an
oversized
phase
ring
into
place
.
the
ideal
size
for
this
ring
is
for
the
central
disk
to
be
just
larger
than
the
objective
entry
aperture
as
viewed
in
the
back
focal
plane
.
the
larger
the
disk
,
the
less
scattered
light
reaches
the
eye
.
this
will
have
the
effect
of
diminishing
the
intensity
of
dispersion
color
and
will
shift
the
actual
color
seen
.
the
colors
seen
vary
even
on
microscopes
from
the
same
manufacturer
.
this
is
due
to
the
different
bands
of
wavelength
exclusion
by
different
mask
sizes
.
the
mask
may
either
reside
in
the
condenser
or
in
the
objective
back
focal
plane
.
it
is
imperative
that
the
analyst
determine
by
experimentation
with
asbestos
standards
what
the
appropriate
colors
should
be
for
each
asbestos
type
.
the
colors
depend
also
on
the
temperature
of
the
preparation
and
the
exact
chemistry
of
the
asbestos
.
therefore
,
some
slight
differences
from
the
standards
should
be
allowed
.
this
is
not
a
serious
problem
for
commercial
asbestos
uses
.
this
technique
is
used
for
identification
of
the
indices
of
refraction
for
fibers
by
recognition
of
color
.
there
is
no
direct
numerical
readout
of
the
index
of
refraction
.
correlation
of
color
to
actual
index
of
refraction
is
possible
by
referral
to
published
conversion
tables
.
this
is
not
necessary
for
the
analysis
of
asbestos
.
recognition
of
appropriate
colors
along
with
the
proper
morphology
are
deemed
sufficient
to
identify
the
commercial
asbestos
minerals
.
other
techniques
including
sem
,
tem
,
and
xrd
may
be
required
to
provide
additional
information
in
order
to
identify
other
types
of
asbestos
.
make
a
preparation
in
the
suspected
matching
high
dispersion
oil
,
eg
,
n1
550
for
chrysotile
.
perform
the
preliminary
tests
to
determine
whether
the
fibers
are
birefringent
or
not
.
take
note
of
the
morphological
character
.
wavy
fibers
are
indicative
of
chrysotile
while
long
,
straight
,
thin
,
frayed
fibers
are
indicative
of
amphibole
asbestos
.
this
can
aid
in
the
selection
of
the
appropriate
matching
oil
.
the
microscope
is
set
up
and
the
polarization
direction
is
noted
as
in
section
44
.
align
a
fiber
with
the
polarization
direction
.
note
the
color
.
this
is
the
color
parallel
to
the
polarizer
.
then
rotate
the
fiber
rotating
the
stage
90
&
cir
;
so
that
the
polarization
direction
is
across
the
fiber
.
this
is
the
perpendicular
position
.
again
note
the
color
.
both
colors
must
be
consistent
with
standard
asbestos
minerals
in
the
correct
direction
for
a
positive
identification
of
asbestos
.
if
only
one
of
the
colors
is
correct
while
the
other
is
not
,
the
identification
is
not
positive
.
if
the
colors
in
both
directions
are
bluishwhite
bluish
white
,
the
analyst
has
chosen
a
matching
index
oil
which
is
higher
than
the
correct
matching
oil
,
eg
.
the
analyst
has
used
n1
620
where
chrysotile
is
present
.
the
next
lower
oil
(
section
35
)
should
be
used
to
prepare
another
specimen
.
if
the
color
in
both
directions
is
yellowwhite
yellow
white
to
strawyellowwhite
straw
yellow
white
,
this
indicates
that
the
index
of
the
oil
is
lower
than
the
index
of
the
fiber
,
eg
.
the
preparation
is
in
n1
550
while
anthophyllite
is
present
.
select
the
next
higher
oil
(
section
35
)
and
prepare
another
slide
.
continue
in
this
fashion
until
a
positive
identification
of
all
asbestos
species
present
has
been
made
or
all
possible
asbestos
species
have
been
ruled
out
by
negative
results
in
this
test
.
certain
plant
fibers
can
have
similar
dispersion
colors
as
asbestos
.
take
care
to
note
and
evaluate
the
morphology
of
the
fibers
or
remove
the
plant
fibers
in
pre
-
preparation
.
coating
material
on
the
fibers
such
as
carbonate
or
vinyl
may
destroy
the
dispersion
color
.
usually
,
there
will
be
some
outcropping
of
fiber
which
will
show
the
colors
sufficient
for
identification
.
when
this
is
not
the
case
,
treat
the
sample
as
described
in
section
33
.
and
then
perform
dispersion
staining
.
some
samples
will
yield
to
becke
line
analysis
if
they
are
coated
or
electron
microscopy
can
be
used
for
identification
.
