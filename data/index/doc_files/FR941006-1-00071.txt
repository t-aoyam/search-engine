this

the

preparation

addenda

the
commission
is
proposing
several
ways
to
streamline
and
shorten
the
audit
process
,
discussed
below
.
in
addition
,
comments
are
welcome
on
whether
the
amount
that
a
candidate
may
receive
for
winding
down
costs
should
be
limited
to
no
more
than
a
flat
dollar
amount

or
a
set
percentage
of

a

if
so

what
should
the
amount

percentage
be
?
if
campaigns
receive
a
set
dollar
amount
,
but
do
not
use
the
entire
amount
for
winding
down
costs
,
should
they
be
permitted
to
retain
the
unspent
amount
?
allowing
them
to
keep
the
remainder
would
serve
as
an
incentive
to
complete
the
winding
down
process
promptly
.
however
,
there
are
public
policy
reasons
for
requiring
the
remaining
funds
to
be
returned
to
the
us
.
treasury
.
placing
a
cap
on
winding
down
expenses
would
assist
the
commissions
goal
of
streamlining
,
but
the
amount
chosen
would
have
to
be
sufficient
to
meet
reasonable
expenses
incurred
in
winding
down
the
campaign
.
another
option
would
be
to
establish
a
cutoff
date
after
which
winding
down
expenses
would
not
longer
be
considered
qualified
campaign
expenses
.
other
suggestions
that
would
simplify
and
shorten
the
required
audit
process
are
encouraged
.
the
proposed
rules

not
include
language

proposals

similarly
,
for

new
language
would
be
added
to

finally
,
new
language
in
sections

would
permit
campaign
committees
to
use
federal
funds
to
defray
the
costs

gifts

monetary
bonuses
for
committee
staff
and
consultants
,
as
long
as
the
gifts

except
bonuses
provided
for

the
outset

limited
to

this
approach
is
somewhat
similar
to
a
provision
included

with
regard
to
bonus
arrangements
provided
for

employment

consulting
contracts

comments
are
sought
on
whether
the
amount
of
these
bonuses
should
be
restricted
to
a
fixed
percentage
of
the
compensation
paid
as
provided
by
the
contract
,
or
whether
these
bonuses
should
be
subject
to
the
overall
$
20000
limit
.
such
an
approach
would
be
intended
to
ensure
that
committees
do
not
give
out
sizable
bonuses
simply
because
they
have
surplus
public
funds
at
the
end
of
the
campaign
