the
potential
for
an
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
product
to
release
breathable
fibers
depends
largely
on
its
degree
of
friability
.
friable
means
that
the
material
can
be
crumbled
with
hand
pressure
and
is
therefore
likely
to
emit
fibers
.
the
fibrous
fluffy
sprayedon
sprayed
on
materials
used
for
fireproofing
,
insulation
,
or
sound
proofing
are
considered
to
be
friable
,
and
they
readily
release
airborne
fibers
if
disturbed
.
materials

nonfriable
friable
if

other
aggressive
operations

asbestos

asbestos
can
cause
disabling

disease
and
various
types
of
cancers
if
the
fibers
are
inhaled

ingesting
fibers
from
contaminated

also
result
in
