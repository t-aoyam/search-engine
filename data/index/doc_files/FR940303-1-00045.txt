also
,
fsis
is
considering
a
requirement
that
the
plant
quality
control
program
provide
the
controls
and
information
necessary
to
assure
that
mdp
manufactured
under
such
a
program
meets
any
requirements
established
and
that
it
will
enable
establishment
personnel
and
fsis
to
monitor
it
for
effectiveness
.
fsis
is
focusing
on
methods
that
will
minimize
interlot
lot
variation
by
maintaining
the
uniformity
of
starting
materials
and
controlling
the
handling
and
processing
of
starting
materials
and
resulting
product
.
because
it
appears
that
this
goal
can
be
achieved
effectively
and
efficiently
where
a
program
for
quality
control
incorporates
appropriate
methods
and
monitoring
techniques
and
adheres
to
good
manufacturing
practice
,
fsis
contemplates
requiring
that
an
establishment
conduct
only
limited
analyses
for
protein
quality
and
fat
,
and
for
mdp
represented
as
containing
not
less
than
14
percent
protein
and
not
more
than
25
percent
fat
,
to
confirm
that
production
is
,
in
fact
,
under
control
.
after
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
the
quality
control
program
is
able
to
yield
complying
product
,
confirmatory
analyses
would
be
required
only
periodically
,
as
long
as
the
product
is
in
compliance
.
fsis
anticipates
establishing
basic
parameters
for
the
chemical
analyses
that
must
be
performed
to
verify
compliance
with
the
requirements
,
eg
,
defining
production
lots
and
sampling
schedules
,
and
the
accepted
methodology
for
performing
analyses
.
fsis
wishes
to
receive
comments
on
the
parameters
necessary
for
an
adequate
quality
control
program

already
provide
the
basic
controls
necessary
to
prevent

and
assure
poultry

wholesomeness
.
however
,
because
the
mechanical
deboning
process
presents
greater
opportunities
for
bacterial
growth
than
traditional
poultry
product
processing
,
fsis
is
considering
amending
the
poultry
products
inspection
regulations
to
more
specifically
address
the
requirements
for
the
various
starting
materials
used
for
mdp
and
the
resulting
product
.
although
the
data
reviewed
in
the
1979
health
and
safety
report
indicate
that
mdp
products
generally
are
acceptable
from
a
microbiological
standpoint
,
the
data
also
show
that
where
bacterial
loads
tend
to
be
higher
,
it
can
be
attributed
to
the
starting
material
used
.
this
is
not
surprising
as
common
starting
materials
for
mechanical
deboning
are
products
that
remain
after
the
removal
of
a
substantial
portion
of
skeletal
muscle
or
other
tissue
(
eg
,
skin
)
from
poultry
carcasses
or
parts
of
carcasses
.
as
a
result
,
the
resistance
of
the
exposed
surface
area
to
microbial
penetration
has
been
reduced
and
the
ratio
of
the
surface
area
to
the
volume
of
total
product
which
is
exposed
to
contaminating
influences
has
been
increased
.
higher
microbial
counts
in
mdp
have
been
associated
with
the
time
and
conditions
of
holding
such
starting
materials
.
mechanically
deboned
poultry
itself
also
presents
opportunities
for
excessive
microbiological
growth
because
it
consists
of
small
particles
which
have
a
greater
surface
area
than
most
poultry
products
and
because
during
its
preparation
any
microorganisms
that
are
present
are
distributed
throughout
the
product
.
fsis
believes
that
potential
bacterial
hazards
are
diminished
as
long
as
handling
accords
with
good
manufacturing
practices
.
fsis
is
,
therefore
,
considering
that
processing
and
storage
requirements
are
warranted
for
the
raw
materials
used
to
make
the
product
and
for
the
product
itself
.
