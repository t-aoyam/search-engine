it
is
not
intended
to
have

this
rule
would
not
preempt

an
irreconcilable
conflict

the
ams
administrator
has
determined
that
this
proposed
rule
,
if
promulgated
,
will
not
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
,
as
defined
by
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
(
5

background
periodically
the
poultry
division
of
ams
reviews
its
existing
regulations
.
as
a
result
of
a
review
,
it
was
determined
that
several
revisions
were
necessary
to
make
the
shell
egg
standards
and
regulations
for
grading
shell
eggs
more
useful
and
efficient
.
the
grading
of
shell
eggs
by
the
ams
is
a
voluntary
program
,
provided
under
the
agricultural
marketing
act
of
1946
,
as
amended
(

.
1621
et

)

basis
.
the
grading
program
is
designed
to
assist
orderly
marketing
of
shell
eggs
.
therefore
,
the
standards
must
keep
abreast
of
new
technology
and
advancements
in
production
and
marketing
practices
.
