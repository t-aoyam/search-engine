the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
contend
that
order
no
.
497d
is
inconsistent
with
order
no
.
636
.
they
assert
that
the
commission
has
unequivocally
found
in
order
no
.
636
that
sales
services
are
competitive
and
has
set
in
motion
a
restructuring
of
the
pipeline
industry
that
is
intended
to
result
in
competition
for
sales
on
an
even
basis
by
producers
,
pipelines
,
and
marketers
.
the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
submit
that
order
no
.
497d
is
at
odds
with
order
no
.
636
in
its
assumption
(
which
is
unsupported
by
record
evidence
)
that
pipelines
possess
sales
and
marketing
information
which
flows
from
the
pipelines
'
anticompetitive
market
power
.
they
state
that
,
as
the
commission
documented
in
order
no
.
636
,
most
pipeline
industry
market
power
has
already
been
eliminated
,
and
some
individual
companies
have
completed
the
transition
to
competitiveness
by
unbundling
.
they
further
state
that
to
remove
the
last
vestiges
of
pipeline
market
power
,
as
the
commission
sees
it
in
order
no
.
636
,
an
industrywide
industry
wide
unbundling
is
to
be
in
place
by
the
start
of
the
199394
heating
season
.
the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
assert
that
in
light
of
unbundling
under
order
no
.
636
,
it
is
inexplicable
how
the
commission
could
see
a
need
to
repromulgate
promulgate
standard
(
f
)
with
regard
to
sales
and
marketing
information
.
they
state
that
when
order
no
.
497
was
issued
,
prior
to
unbundling
,
the
commissions
intent
was
to
prevent
preferential
treatment
of
an
affiliated
marketer
by
an
interstate
pipeline
in
the
provision
of
transportation
services
.
the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
state
that
,
as
recognized
by
the
commission
,
pipelines
have
no
monopoly
power
over
sales
.
they
assert
that
it
is
only
a
pipelines
transportation
function
which
even
arguably
puts
it
in
a
position
of
being
able
to
favor
its
own
marketing
affiliates
.
consequently
,
they
argue
that
the
standards
of
conduct
under
order
no
.
497
should
only
apply
to
pipeline
transportation
information
.
the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
contend
that
the
new
contemporaneous
disclosure
requirement
in
order
no
.
497d
imposes
unnecessary
and
unreasonable
burdens
upon
pipelines
.
they
state
that
,
as
chair
moler
noted
in
her
dissent
to
order
no
.
497d
,
the
standards
of
conduct
under
order
no
.
497
already
preclude
pipelines
from
disclosing
to
marketing
affiliates
any
information
obtained
from
nonaffiliated
affiliated
shippers
,
or
otherwise
giving
any
advantages
or
preferences
to
their
marketing
affiliates
in
the
provision
of
transportation
service
.
the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
assert
that
these
requirements
effectively
prevent
pipelines
from
using
any
remaining
market
power
they
have
over
transportation
services
to
benefit
their
marketing
affiliates
,
and
make
the
order
no
.
497d
disclosure
requirements
unnecessary
.
the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
do
not
believe
that
in
light
of
all
of
the
current
competition
in
the
natural
gas
industry
,
pipelines
have
significant
market
power
over
transportation
service
.
however
,
to
the
extent
there
is
any
remaining
market
power
over
transportation
service
,
the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
argue
that
the
order
no
.
497
standards
of
conduct
adequately
address
this
issue
without
a
need
for
the
contemporaneous
disclosure
requirement
for
sales
and
marketing
information
.
they
submit
that
the
commissions
imposition
of
the
order
no
.
497d
contemporaneous
disclosure
requirement
only
serves
to
benefit
pipeline
competitors
,
and
imposes
unnecessary
burdens
on
pipelines
.
the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
argue
that
the
commission
cites
no
evidence
to
support
its
critical
conclusion
that
the
sales
and
marketing
information
that
a
pipeline
derives
from
its
ongoing
relationship
with
its
customers
is
a
product
of
either
past
or
present
anticompetitive
market
power
.
they
assert
that
the
commissions
error
on
this
point
is
exacerbated
by
its
lack
of
jurisdiction
to
regulate
the
disclosure
of
sales
or
marketing
information
at
all
.
the
pipelines
and
joint
parties
state
,
as
the
court
noted
,
because
the
commission
is
authorized
to
regulate
only
those
practices
that
are
unduly
discriminatory
or
preferential
,
the
commission
appears
to
lack
the
authority
to
prevent
pipelines
from
preferring
their
affiliates
with
exclusive
access
to
sales
or
marketing
information
unless
that
sort
of
preference
is
undue
.
the
pipelines
and
joint
parties
contend
that
the
commission
cannot
resolve
questions
about
the
very
existence
of
its
authority
based
on
nothing
more
than
its
sense
that
the
informational
advantages
that
a
gas
marketer
derives
from
an
affiliated
pipeline
result
from
anticompetitive
market
power
rather
than
the
economic
efficiencies
of
vertical
integration
.
the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
submit
that
the
contemporaneous
disclosure
requirement
also
exceeds
the
commissions
lawful
authority
because
the
commission
is
only
empowered
to
act
with
respect
to
any
transportation
or
sale
of
natural
gas
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
.
they
state
that
the
contemporaneous
disclosure
requirement
apparently
applies
to
the
sharing
of
information
regardless
of
whether
a
jurisdictional
service
is
being
performed
.
the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
assert
that
there
is
plainly
no
lawful
basis
for
the
commission
to
extend
its
regulation
to
nonjurisdictional
jurisdictional
services
.
the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
argue
that
even
assuming
that
the
pipeline
generates
certain
sales
and
marketing
information
that
is
not
publicly
available
,
mere
sharing
of
this
information
with
an
affiliate
does
not
translate
into
a
transportation
advantage
for
an
affiliate
,
ie
,
even
if
the
pipeline
informs
an
affiliate
of
a
potential
sales
market
,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
pipeline
can
automatically
provide
the
affiliate
with
the
transportation
capacity
necessary
to
complete
the
deal
.
indeed
,
they
assert
that
the
affording
of
such
a
preference
is
precluded
under
§
1613c
)
which
states
that
a
pipeline
may
not
give
its
marketing
affiliate
preference
over
nonaffiliated
customers
in
matters
relating
to
part
284
transportation
,
including
,
but
not
limited
to
,
scheduling
,
balancing
,
transportation
,
storage
,
or
curtailment
priority
.
the
pipelines
and
the
joint
parties
contend
that
all
the
commissions
contemporaneous
disclosure
requirement
does
is
to
limit
the
flow
of
information
in
the
market
in
a
manner
which
hinders
competition
and
serves
no
legitimate
purpose
.
