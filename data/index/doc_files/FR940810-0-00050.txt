definition
:
the
court
asked
that
osha
clarify
the
exemption
for
`
small
scale
,
short
duration
operations
'
from
the
negativepressure
negative
pressure
enclosure
(
npe
)
requirements
of
the
construction
standard
.
the
negative
pressure
enclosure
requirements
are
a
substantial
set
of
requirements
.
they
include
creating
a
system
of
regulated
areas
with
a
sealed
work
area
under
negative
pressure
,
decontamination
facilities
and
procedures
,
clean
room
facilities
and
procedures
and
shower
facilities
,
and
other
practices
to
reduce
worker
exposure
and
spread
of
contamination
outside
the
work
area
.
in
that
standard
,
npes
were
required
for
all
removal
,
demolition
and
renovation
work
except
for
small
scale
short
duration
operations
.
the
court
suggested
,
based
on
its
view
of
the
agencys
earlier
intent
,
that
osha
limit
the
exemption
to
work
operations
where
it
is
impractical
to
construct
an
enclosure
because
of
the
configuration
of
the
work
environment
.
in
an
earlier
response
to
the
remand
order
,
published
in
the
federal
register
(

,
osha
declined
to

the
regulatory
text
on
the
smallscale

,
short

issue
,
without
conducting

the
agency
explained
`
that
explicitly
limiting
the
exemption
to
situations
where
negative

enclosures
are
impractical
might
not
reduce
employee
risk
from

exposure
'
(

osha
stated
that
in
the
supplemental
rulemaking
,
it
intended
`
to

the
effectiveness
and

of

and
to

under
what

systems
may
be
used
'
(

at

.
osha
also
noted
that
the
smallscale
small
scale
,
short
duration
issue
is
related
to
the
scope
of
the
`
competent
person
'
requirement
,
which
the
1986
standard
lifted
for
operations
which
conformed
to
the
exception
,
and
thus
combined
consideration
of
both
issues
would
be
appropriate
.
accordingly
,
in
july
l990
,
osha
proposed
related
changes
in
both
provisions
`
small
scale
,
short
duration
'
operations
would
be
redefined
in
terms
of
general
criteria
,
as
well
as
the
1986
approach
of
listing
specific
examples
.
however
,
the
underlying
premise
remained
the
same
as
in
the
1986
standard
:
ie
.
exemptions
to
the
negativepressure
negative
pressure
enclosure
requirement
for
removal
,
renovation
and
demolition
projects
and
limited
to
jobs
which
conformed
to
specified
criteria
.
`
competent
'
persons
,
according
to
the
1990
proposal
,
were
to
be
required
as
supervisors
on
all
asbestosrelated
asbestos
related
construction
worksites
,
instead
of
as
in
the
1986
standard
,
that
required
competent
persons
only
for
non
`
smallscale
small

training
for
competent
persons
,
would
vary
,
however
,
depending
on
the
kind
of
asbestos
-
related
job
needing
supervision
.
the
final
provisions
resolving
these
issues
,
are
different
from
the
proposal
.
four
classes
of
increasingly
hazardous
types
of
construction
activity
are
matched
with
increasingly
stringent
control
requirements
.
class
i
asbestos
work
means
activities
involving
the
removal
of
asbestos
containing
material
(
acm
)
and
presumed
asbestos
containing
material
(
pacm
)
which
is
`
high
risk
'
class
ii
asbestos
work
means
activities
involving
the
removal
of
acm
and
pacm
which
is
not
`
high
risk
'
class
iii
asbestos
work
means
activities
involving
repair
and
maintenance
where
acm
and
pacm
is
disturbed
.
class
iv
asbestos
work
means
maintenance
and
custodial
activities
during
which
employees
contact
acm
and
pacm
and
activities
to
clean
up
waste
and
debris
containing
acm
and
pacm
.
each
class
includes
work
with
similar
exposure
levels
and
with
similar
exposure
risks
.
each
has
a
prescribed
set
of
controls
and
work
practices
.
basically
only
class
i
work
,
highrisk
high
risk
activities
,
require
negativepressure
negative
pressure
enclosures
.
the
standard
allows
other
designated
proven
control
systems
in
limited
circumstances
and
provides
for
yettobedeveloped
yet
to
be
developed
systems
if
certain
backstop
provisions
are
met
.
as
indicated
in
its
earlier
responses
to
the
court
,
and
its
public
notices
of
proposed
rulemaking
,
osha
has
evaluated
available
control
technologies
and
has
concluded
that
the
use
of
negativepressure
negative
pressure
control
enclosures
should
be
regulated
in
terms
of
when
they
are
required
rather
than
when
they
are
not
.
in
a
major
departure
from
the
language
of
both
the
1986
standard
and
the
proposal
,
osha
is
deleting
the
term
`
small
scale
,
short
duration
'
from
the
regulatory
text
.
instead
,
the
agency
is
distinguishing
high
-
from
lowerrisk
lower
risk
operations
through
the
use
of
the
classification
system
described
above
.
work
that
was
exempted
from
the
negative
pressure
enclosure
requirements
in
the
existing
standard
because
it
was
of
`
smallscale
small
scale
,
shortduration
short
duration
'
are
considered
to
be
class
ii
and
class
iii
work
in
this
amendment
.
the
agency
finds
that
the
term
`
smallscale
small
scale
,
short
term
'
is
too
limiting
,
is
confusing
,
and
cannot
be
defined
with
sufficient
precision
to
serve
the
purpose
of
distinguishing
high
risk

asbestos

activity
from
