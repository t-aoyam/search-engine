is
stored
on

5
under
conditions
set
forth
in
the
07/19/1992
settlement
agreement
between
doe
and
the
state
of
nevada
.
a
consent
agreement
signed
by
doe
and
the
nevada
division
of
environmental
protection
in
1994
allows
storage
at
area
5
of
mixed
waste
generated
during
characterization
activities
.
through
1994
there
have
been
1054
nuclear
tests
conducted
by
the
united
states
,
928
of
which
were
conducted
on
the
nevada
test
site
.
defense
research
and
weapons
test
verification
activities
were
conducted
at
other
test
locations
in
nevada
.
nuclear
devices
were
detonated
underground
at
the
project
shoal
area
and
the
central
nevada
test
area
.
from
1957
to
1963
,
many
safety
tests
using
special
nuclear
materials
and
chemical
explosives
were
conducted
at
sites
on
the
nevada
test
site
,
nellis
air
force
range
,
and
tonopah
test
range
to
test
the
safety
of
nuclear
weapons
in
accident
situations
.
these
tests
have
resulted
in
the
release
of
radioactive
materials
and
surface
contamination
over
large
areas
.
the
yucca
mountain
site
is
located
on
the
southwestern
boundary
of
the
nevada
test
site
.
in
the
1987
amendments
to
the
nuclear
waste
policy
act
(
nwpa
,
congress
directed
doe
to
characterize
the
yucca
mountain
site
for
possible
development
of
a
geologic
repository
for
disposal
of
spent
nuclear
fuel
and
high
level
nuclear
waste
.
prior
to
passage
of
the
1987
amendments
,
doe
had
prepared
an
environmental
assessment
(
ea
)
which
included
an
analysis
of
the
effects
of
site
characterization
activities
at
yucca
mountain
(
doe/rw0073
,
05/19/1986
.
if
doe
ultimately
recommends
approval
of
the
yucca
mountain
site
to
the
president
,
that
recommendation
must
be
accompanied
by
an
eis
prepared
under
the
specific
provisions
of
the
nwpa
.
all
activities
regarding
the
characterization
of
the
yucca
mountain
site
,
and
any
eventual
construction
and
operation
of
a
repository
,
including
environmental
review
,
are
regulated
by
the
process
prescribed
in
the
nwpa
.
therefore
,
the

eis
will
address
ongoing
yucca

site
characterization
activities
only
as
they
relate
to
the
cumulative
impacts
of
activities
on
the

preliminary

alternatives
the
proposed

is
to
develop

for

the

needs
a

plan
that
would
allow

to
continue

in
a
way
that
minimizes
or
avoids
environmental
impacts
.
a
preliminary
set
of
resource
management
alternatives
for
evaluation
in
the
eis
has
been
identified
below
.
the
final
set
of
alternatives
and
issues
to
be
considered
in

will
reflect
consideration
of
the
public
input
received
during

scoping
period
.
no

under
the
no

alternative
,
existing

site
and
at
offsite
off

test
locations
within
the

.
offsite
off

activities
would
be
consistent
with
the
applicable
land

plans
of
the
controlling

.
this
alternative
includes
the
potential
to
resume
underground
nuclear
testing
and
conducting
other
nuclear
weapon
related
experiments
at
the
nevada
test
site
.

and
in

continuing

expanded

under
this

,
maximum

would
be
made
of
the
nevada
test
site
in
support
of
national
programs
of
both
a
defense
and
nondefense
defense
nature
.
national
defense
activities
could
include
a
resumption
of
underground
nuclear
testing
with
the
required
support
activities
;
conducting
other
nuclear

related
experiments
;
the
construction

;
tritium

;
plutonium
storage

;
nuclear

storage
and
disassembly
and
similar
activities
that
could
be
best
conducted
at
a
remote

.
the
site
could
also
be
used
for
various
exercises
and
technology
development
aimed
at
countering
nuclear
terrorism
or
proliferation
activities
.
nondefense
non
defense
programs
could
include
the
study
of
alternative
energy
sources
including
the
construction
and
operation
of
various
solar
energy
facilities
that
would
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
the
technologies
;
expanded
use
of
the
liquefied

facility
;
and
increased
use
of
the

as
an
environmental
research
