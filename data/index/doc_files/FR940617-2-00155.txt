with
reference
to
the
policy
statement
issued
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
on
11/03/1993
,
i
am
writing
to
request
exemptions
from
rules
10b6
,
1067
and
10b8
under
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
for
french
issuers
to
the
extent
set
forth
in
part

i
.
offerings
by
french
companies
the
structure
of
an
offering
of
equity
securities
in
a
french
company
varies
depending
on
whether
it
is
a
primary
or
a
secondary
offering
.
a
.
primary
offerings
french
law
grants
shareholders
of
a
french
company
preemptive
emptive
rights
to
subscribe
for
shares
issued
by
such
company
.
french
law
also
authorizes
shareholders
,
voting
at
a
shareholders
meeting
,
to
renounce
such
preemptive
emptive
rights
.
in
practice
,
in
the
case
of
a
renunciation
of
such
preemptive
emptive
rights
,
most
offerings
are
conducted
so
as
to
grant
current
shareholders
a
priority
right
to
purchase
new
shares
before
the
general
public
during
a
period
of
5
to
10
days
.

offerings
with
preemptive
pre
emptive
rights
offerings
with
preemptive
emptive
rights
permit
the
current
shareholders
to
participate
in
the
capital
increase
pro
rata
or
to
sell
their
preemptive
emptive
rights
,
which
are
securities
separable
from
the
shares
,
on
the
market
.
the
existence
of
a
negotiable
preemptive
emptive
right
permits
detachment
of
the
offering
price
from
the
stock
market
price
,
because
the
shareholders
who
do
not
want
to
participate
in
an
offering
can
,
by
selling
their
rights
on
the
market
,
be
compensated
for
the
dilution
which
could
result
from
an
offering
price
which
is
significantly
less
than
the
market
price
and
or
than
their
share
in
the
net
assets
.
the
discount
from
the
stock
market
price
is
generally
10
%
to
20
.
the
technique
of
an
offering
with
preemptive
emptive
rights
is
principally
used
for
offerings
of
shares
rather
than
for
those
of
`
composite
securities
,
such
as
bonds
with
warrants
or
bonds
convertible
into
shares
,
for
reasons
of
valuation
and
quotation
on
the
appropriate
stock
market
.
