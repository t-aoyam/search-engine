however
,
the
commission
has
at
times
encountered
incidents
involving
the
mismanagement
or
negligent
handling
of
public
funds
that
do
not
fall
into
either
of
these
categories
.
the
proposed
rules
therefore
seek
to
clarify
how
such
negligence
and
mismanagement
is
handled
in
the
audit
process
.
the
commission
is
seeking
comment
on
whether
,
as
a
precondition
for
the
receipt
of
public
funds
,
the
candidate
should
agree
to
meet
certain
standards
in
handling
public
monies
as
well
as
in
overseeing
the
use
of
and
accounting
for
public
funds
.
such
standards
would
be
specified
at
11
cfr
90031b
)
and
90331b
.
if
this
approach
is
taken
,
the
commission
welcomes
comment
on
what
standards
)
would
be
appropriate
.
the
proposed
rules
would
amend
11
cfr
90044b
)
and
90344b
,
to
clarify
that
the
cost
of
items
that
are
lost
or
misplaced
due
to
negligence
of
a
campaign
committee
will
be
considered
a
nonqualified
qualified
expense
for
purposes
of
these
rules
.
however
,
the
commission
recognizes
that
there
are
varying
degrees
of
negligence
in
this
area
,
and
that
certain
factors
should
be
considered
prior
to
any
determination
that
a
repayment
is
required
.
for
example
,
these
factors
could
include
,
but
would
not
be
listed
to
,
whether
the
committee
demonstrates
that
it
made
careful
efforts
to
safeguard
the
missing
equipment
;
the
type
of
equipment
involved
;
the
number
of
items
that
were
lost
;
and
the
value
of
the
lost
equipment
as
a
percentage
of
the
total
value
of
the
equipment
leased
or
owned
by
the
committee
.
on
this
latter
point
,
the
commission
notes
that
a
lost
item
,
such
as
a
newlyacquired
newly
acquired
vehicle
,
may
involve
a
major
investment
of
taxpayer
funds
,
irrespective
of
the
fact
that
its
cost
is
only
a
small
percentage
of
the
total
amount
of
equipment
leased
or
owned
by
the
campaign
committee
.
the
commission
welcomes
comments
on
other
factors
that
should
be
considered
in
making
this
determination
.
another
approach
would
be
to
limit
the
dollar
amount
of
lost
property
that
could
be
considered
a
qualified
campaign
expense
.
if
a
committee
lost
goods
worth
more
than
the
specified
amount
,
any
amount
over
that
figure
would
be
a
nonqualified
qualified
campaign
expense
.
this
would
have
the
advantage
of
not
requiring
the
commission
to
get
involved
in
what
could
become
a
substantial
number
of
negligence
determinations
,
while
recognizing
that
some
loss
is
inevitable
in
large
,
lengthy
campaigns
.
the
commission
welcomes
comments
on
this
approach
as
well
as
on
what
reimbursement
limit
should
be
specified
,
if
this
were
to
be
adopted
.
the
commission
is
also
seeking
comments
on
how
lost
or
stolen
uninsured
items
should
be
reflected
on
statements
of
net
outstanding
campaign
obligations
[
noco
.
if
an
item
is
lost
through
negligence
,
the
question
is
whether
it
should
continue
to
be
treated
as
an
asset
for
purposes
of
the
noco
statement
to
avoid
increasing
the
committees
entitlement
.
comments
are
welcome
on
how
this
should
be
done
