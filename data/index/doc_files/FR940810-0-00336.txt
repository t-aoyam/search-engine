two
commenters
suggested
that
,
if
an
exception
is
granted
,
there
would
be
no
comparative
data
on
student
achievement
as
there
now
are
with
pre
-
and
postnormreferenced
norm
referenced
test
scores
.
discussion
:
it
is
true
that
comparative
data
on
individual
children
would
not
be
required
under
an
exception
just
as
it
is
not
required
under
the
statute
.
however
,
regardless
of
whether
a
state
assessment
system
includes
comparative
data
,
nothing
would
prevent
an
lea
from
augmenting
the
state
assessment
system
to
obtain
comparative
data
if
the
lea
believes
the
data
would
be
useful
.
changes

none

comment
:
several
commenters
suggested
that
the
basic
technical
standards
contained
in
§
200
81
of
the
chapter
1
regulations
be
maintained
.
discussion
:
the
chapter
1
statute
does
not
mandate
that
specific
technical
standards
be
prescribed
.
moreover
,
exceptions
granted
under
these
regulations
would
govern
a
limited
period
from
the
present
until
the
reauthorization
of
chapter
1
takes
effect
.
the
secretary
does
not
want
to
prescribe
technical
standards
for
this
limited
period
that
may
run
counter
to
standards
that
may
be
required
under
reauthorization
.
in
addition
,
these
regulations
come
at
a
time
when
the
testing
community
,
in
general
,
is
grappling
with
new
forms
of
assessments
that
better
measure
what
children
should
know
and
be
able
to
do
and
redefining
what
technical
standards
best
meet
the
needs
of
those
assessments
.
the
technical
standards
in
§
200
81
of
the
current
regulations
are
often
construed
as
prohibiting
assessments
other
than
those
that
are
nationally
normed
or
those
that
are
modeled
after
these
tests
.
the
secretary
is
very
concerned
,
however
,
that
state
assessment
systems
being
developed
to
support
systemic
education
reform
efforts
are
of
high
quality
and
useful
and
that
exceptions
under
these
regulations
only
would
be
granted
where
evaluation
results
under
chapter
1
and
the
mep
provide
meaningful
indicators
about
the
progress
under
chapter
1
and
mep
.
the
secretary
,
therefore
,
is
requiring
under
these
regulations
the
following
basic
technical
standards
for
the
assessment
system
:
(
1
)
that
the
system
yields
consistent
results
and
(
2
)
that
those
results
accurately
reflect
what
the
assessment
system
was
designed
to
measure
.
the
secretary
has
determined
that
to
impose
any
additional
technical
standards
on
new
assessment
measures
for
the
chapter
1
and
mep
programs
is
not
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
results
of
evaluations
of
these
programs
are
sufficiently
meaningful
and
useful
.
the
secretary
is
confident
that
the
other
requirements
of
these
regulations
ensure
that
a
state
would
not
implement
a
new
assessment
system
and
make
educational
judgments
based
on
results
from
that
system
until
the
state
has
determined
that
the
assessment
accurately
measures
what
children
are
expected
to
know
and
be
able
to
do
.
changes
:
as
noted
above
,
§
200
90
)
and
201
57
)
have
been
revised
to
require
that
an
assessment
system
for
which
an
exception
has
been
requested
must
yield
consistent
results
that
accurately
reflect
what
the
assessment
system
was
designed
to
measure
and
may
not
impair
the
seas
or
leas
ability
to
account
for
results
under
chapter
1
or
the
mep
.
comment
:
one
commenter
asked
whether
the
feeder
pattern
concept
would
be
acceptable
in
leas
with
schools
that
do
not
contain
a
grade
in
which
the
state
administers
an
assessment
.
for
example
,
if
a
state
assessment
consists
of
a
test
in
third
grade
,
the
commenter
asked
whether
it
would
be
permissible
for
schools
with
only
grades
k2
to
be
considered
part
of
a
k6
grade
span
.
another
commenter
suggested
adding
clarifying
language
that
information
be
available
from
at
least
one
grade
`
in
each
chapter
1
school
'
discussion
:
the
proposed
regulations
stated
that
a
state
assessment
system
must
provide
information
about
the
yearly
performance
of
each
chapter
1
school
and
that
this
information
must
be
from
at
least
one
grade
level
.
it
was
the
secretarys
assumption
that
,
to
meet
this
requirement
,
a
states
assessment
system
would
have
to
provide
information
from
at
least
one
grade
level
in
each
chapter
1
school
.
to
clarify
this
assumption
,
however
,
the
regulations
have
been
revised
accordingly
.

that

clearer
