supplementary
information
:
background
the
new
england
fishery
management
council
(
council
)
submitted
amendment
5
to
nmfs
on
09/27/1993
.
one
of
its
principal
objectives
was
to
reduce
the
bycatch
of
harbor
porpoise
in
the
gulf
of
maine
sink
gillnet
fishery
by
the
end
of
year
4
of
implementation
of
the
amendment
to
a
level
not
to
exceed
2
percent
of
the
population
,
based
on
the
best
estimates
of
abundance
and
bycatch
.
the
council
was
requested
by
nmfs
in
10/19/1992
to
take
action
to
reduce
the
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
within
the
context
of
amendment
5
.
the
council
agreed
to
develop
fishery
management
measures
that
would
address
the
issue
on
the
basis
that
the
sink
gillnet
fishery
was
subject
to
regulation
under
the
fmp
,
there
were
no
existing
regulatory
mechanisms
to
reduce
porpoise
takes
,
and
the
current
level
of
bycatch
in
the
fishery
was
not
sustainable
.
additionally
,
on
01/07/1993
,
nmfs
published
a
proposed
rule
(
58
fr
3108
)
to
list
the
gulf
of
maine
population
of
harbor
porpoise
as
threatened
under
the
endangered
species
act
(
esa
,
due
primarily
to
the
level
of
incidental
takes
in
the
sink
gillnet
fishery
and
the
lack
of
an
adequate
regulatory
mechanism
to
accomplish
bycatch
reductions
.
as
nmfs
noted
in
the
rule
,
the
marine
mammal
exemption
program
contained
in
the
1988
amendments
to
the
marine
mammal
protection
act
(
mmpa
)
did
not
set
bycatch
limits
.
the
council
subsequently
adopted
the
goal
of
achieving
reductions
in
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
,
so
that
the
actual
amount
of
harbor
porpoise
caught
as
bycatch
in
the
sink
gillnet
fishery
would
not
exceed
2
percent
of
the
estimates
of
the
harbor
porpoise
population
,
in
part
to
avoid
the
pending
esa
listing
.
this
objective
was
based
on
a
recruitment
rate
for
harbor
porpoise
that
is
about
4
percent
per
year
,
and
a
conservative
fisheries
bycatch
level
that
should
not
exceed
50
percent
of
the
recruitment
rate
for
marine
mammals
.
the
1991/1992
pooled
harbor
porpoise
population
abundance
estimate
is
47200
.
using
the
lower
bound
of
the
95percent
percent
confidence
interval
for
that
estimate
,
39500
,
the
1990
,
1991
,
and
1992
ratios
of
bycatch
to
average
population
abundance
were
approximately
6
percent
,
43
percent
and
22
percent
,
respectively
.
a
2percent
percent
goal
allocated
solely
to
the
gulf
of
maine
sink
gillnet
fishery
did
not
take
into
account
the
unknown
level
of
harbor
porpoise
takes
in
the
midatlantic
mid
atlantic
region
and
in
adjacent
canadian
waters
.
because
the
1992
abundance
and
bycatch
information
was
not
available
until
06/19/1993
,
however
,
development
of
effective
measures
based
on
the
best
scientific
information
lagged
behind
the
formulation
of
the
overall
amendment
5
package
.
the
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
mitigation
measure
implemented
by
the
final
rule
for
the
amendment
required
the
removal
of
all
sink
gillnets
from
the
water
during
4day
day
blocks
of
time
each
month
in
year
1
after
implementation
of
amendment
5
.
years
2
and
3
of
amendment
5
called
for
8day
day
blocks
each
month
.
year
4
required
12day
day
blocks
and
year
5
required
16day
day
blocks
.
the
council
supported
,
and
nmfs
approved
,
the
use
of
blocks
of
time
as
an
interim
measure
on
the
assumption
that
appropriate
time
and
area
management
measures
would
be
developed
as
soon
as
possible
.
the
rationale
for
the
interim
measure
was
based
largely
on
the
lack
of
information
concerning
the
sink
gillnet
fishery
.
by
`
masking
'
periods
of
time
monthly
,
during
which
all
sink
gillnets
must
be
removed
from
the
water
,
the
time
during
which
harbor
porpoise
would
be
exposed
to
that
gear
would
be
reduced
.
in
a
simulation
analyzing
the
effect
of
closing
the
gulf
of
maine
sink
gillnet
fishery
for
4
consecutive
random
days
per
month
,
approximately
85
percent
of
the
fish
would
not
be
landed
and
93
percent
of
the
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
would
be
avoided
.
the
effect
of
choosing
random
days
,
however
,
produced
very
different
values
of
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
for
the
different
trials
.
