we
are
amending

accreditation
of

to
add
a

we
have

supplementary
information
:
background
the
regulations
in
9
cfr
parts
160
,
161
,
and
162
pertain
to
the
animal
and
plant
health
inspection
services
(
aphis
)
veterinary
accreditation
program
.
through
this
program
,
aphis
authorizes
veterinarians
in
private
practice
to
perform
certain
official
services
and
duties
on
behalf
of
aphis
veterinary
services
officials
.
these
responsibilities
include
such
activities
as
examining
livestock
for
clinical
signs
of
disease
,
vaccinating
animals
for
brucellosis
,
drawing
and
shipping
blood
for
testing
,
and
preparing
health
certificates
required
for
domestic
or
international
movement
.
section
1613
(
hereafter
referred
to
as
the
regulations
)
sets
forth
the
standards
for
accredited
veterinarian
duties
.
the
regulations
cover
several
requirements
and
prohibitions
regarding
the
preparation
of
official
forms
,
certificates
,
records
and
reports
.
the
regulations
use
the
term
`
sign
'
as
used
in
the
regulations
,
`
sign
'
means
that
an
accredited
veterinarian
signs
a
document
,
in
his
or
her
own
hand
.
however
,
`
sign
'
is
not
defined
in
the
regulations
.
this
has
led
to
some
confusion
concerning
the
signature
requirements
.
therefore
,
to
clarify
the
regulations
,
we
published
in
the
federal
register
on
03/18/1994
(
58
fr
1286312864
,
docket
no
.
930331
,
a
proposal
to
amend
the
regulations
to
add
a
definition
of
`
sign
'
we
solicited
comments
concerning
our
proposal
for
a
60day
day
comment
period
ending
05/17/1994
.
we
received
two
comments
by
that
date
.
they
were
from
a
state
department
of
agriculture
and
from
a
veterinary
medical
association
.
one
commenter
supported
the
proposed
rule
.
the
other
commenter
objected
to
the
proposed
rule
,
saying
it
is
the
prerogative
of
business
owners
,
including
veterinarians
,
to
authorize
other
individuals
to
sign
documents
using
the
business
owners
name
.
we
are
not
making
any
changes
in
the
rule
based
on
this
comment
.
a
business
owners
right
to
authorize
others
to
sign
documents
is
not
unlimited
.
accredited
veterinarians
are
authorized
by
the
federal
government
to
perform
certain
functions
on
behalf
of
the
federal
government
.
these
include
signing
documents
.
veterinarians
are
accredited
only
if
they
meet
certain
standards
.
other
persons
,
to
whom
veterinarians
might
delegate
their
responsibilities
under
the
accreditation
program
,
might
not
meet
the
federal
governments
accreditation
standards
.
this
could
lead
to
foreign
animal
health
officials
losing
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
the
veterinary
accreditation
program
.
this
,
in
turn
,
could
result
in
the
loss
of
export
markets
for
us
.
livestock
.
therefore
,
based
on
the
rationale
set
forth
in
the
proposed
rule
and
in
this
document
,
we
are
adopting
the
provisions
of
the
proposal
as
a
final
rule
without
change
.
executive
order
12866
and
regulatory
flexibility
act
this
final
rule
has
been
reviewed
under
executive
order
12866
.
the
rule
has
been
determined
to
be
not
significant
for
purposes
of
executive
order
12866
,
and
,
therefore
,
has
not
been
reviewed
by
the
office
of
management
and
budget
.
this
final
rule
will
merely
clarify
that
accredited
veterinarians
must
sign
official
documents
in
their
own
hand
.
we
do
not
anticipate
that
this
final
rule
will
have
any
economic
effect
whatsoever
.
under
these
circumstances
,
the
administrator
of
the
animal
and
plant
health
inspection
service
has
determined
that
this
action
will
not
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
.
