section

is
amended
to
delete
the
agency
reporting
requirement
and
to
add
a
requirement
that
agencies
that
do
public
service
monitoring
provide
an
oral
notice
or
beep
tone
at
the
beginning
of
a
call
.
this
section
currently
prohibits
agencies
listeningin
listening
in
to
or
recording
telephone
conversations
,
on
a
gsaprovided
gsa
provided
telephone
system
,
any
telephone

acquired
under
a
delegation
of
gsa
procurement
authority
,
or
any
telecommunications
system
approved
in
accordance
with
the
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act
of
1949
,
as
amended
,
except
under
certain
circumstances
.
agencies
that
listenin
listen
in
or
record
conversations
for
public
safety
,
public
service
monitoring
or
to
assist
individuals
with
disabilities
must
notify
gsa
in
writing
at
least
30
days
before
the
operational
date
.
this
notification
provision
is
being
removed
because
it
places
an
unnecessary
burden
on
agencies
.
gsa
does
not
have
any
affirmative
enforcement
or
other
function
with
regard
to
listeningin
listening
in
that
would
make
this
reporting
requirement
necessary
.
such
responsibilities
rest
solely
with
the
reporting
agency
.
accordingly
,
in
line
with
placing
authority
and
responsibility
at
the
appropriate
level
,
this
reporting
requirement
will
be
removed
as
will
the
provision
that
gsa
will
periodically
review
agency
listeningin
listening
in
activities
.
section
201603
paragraph
(
d4ii
)
requires
that
agencies
that
perform
public
service
monitoring
provide
for
continuous
positive
action
to
inform
the
public
of
that
monitoring
.
some
agencies
have
interpreted
this
to
mean
that
including
a
statement
in
agency
publications
that
calls
to
the
agency
may
be
monitored
meets
this
requirements
.
after
careful
review
,
gsa
has
determined
that
since
all
callers
may
not
see
such
publications
,
additional
notification
is
required
.
accordingly
,
we
propose
adding
a
provision
that
requires
agencies
to
provide
an
upfront
announcement
or
beep
tone
at
the
beginning
of
a
call
to
advise
callers
of
potential
monitoring
.
since
such
an
announcement
may
increase
communications
costs
,
we
request
that
agencies
provide
us
detailed
information
about
any
negative
impact
implementation
of
this
provision
may
have
on
them
.
we
will
carefully
review
this
information
before
reaching
a
decision
on
whether
to
include
this
provision
in
the
final
rule
.
(

section
20121
604
,
requires
agencies
to
forward
to
gsa
copies
of
each
order
for
toll
free
telephone
service
.
documentation
submitted
is
to
include
estimates
of
monthly
costs
and
usage
,
and
cite
the
relevant
statute
,
executive
order
,
or
other
regulation
directing
the
toll
free
service
.
this
provision
is
being
removed
because
the
use
of
tollfree
toll
free
telephone
services
are
sufficiently
routine
that
close
supervision
by
gsa
is
no
longer
needed
.
removal
of
this
provision
reduces
costly
and
burdensome
overregulation
regulation
and
places
authority
and
responsibility
with
the
agency
.
(

section

is
revised
to
expand
the
scope
of
the
subpart
.
currently
,
this

requires
agencies
to
review
the
use
of
equipment
that
is
already
outdated
and
to
determine
if
continued
use
is
economical
.
this
provision
is
revised
also
to
expand
the
scope
of
the
review
to
include
equipment
that
may
be
obsolescent
.
this
change
is
made
to
encourage
agencies
to
ensure
that
their
fip
equipment
always
remains
economical
and
efficient
.
guidelines
are
provided
to
assist
agencies
in
identifying
obsolescent
equipment
.
agencies
are
encouraged
to
replace
their
obsolescent
equipment
if
the
cost
of
continued
use
exceeds
the
cost
of
acquiring
and
operating
newer
technology
.
