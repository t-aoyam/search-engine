kt
disagrees
,
claiming
that
the
cost
verification
report
clearly
indicates
that
kt
accurately
reported
all
direct
labor
and
factory
overhead
expenses
incurred
during
the
poi
.
thus
,
kt
contends
that
petitioners
'
claim
that
the
department
was
unable
to
verify
kts
fabrication
costs
should
be
dismissed
out
of
hand
.
kt
states
that
it
allocated
fabrication
costs
between
industrial
and
ornamental
pipe
production
based
on
the
actual
staffing
for
factory
laborers
,
the
actual
usage
of
production
equipment
,
the
companys
actual
production
experience
and
,
for
variable
overhead
expenses
,
budgeted
usage
rates
.
according
to
kt
,
the
difference
between
fabrication
expenses
per
kilogram
for
industrial
and
ornamental
pipe
reflects
the
fact
that
kt
produces
more
industrial
pipe
than
ornamental
pipe
.
additionally
,
kt
claims
that
the
department
should
accept
its
submission
methodology
of
allocating
fabrication
costs
on
the
basis
of
weight
for
three
reasons
.
first
,
the
methodology
conforms
with
the
way
in
which
kt
calculates
the
cost
of
goods
sold
in
the
normal
course
of
business
,
and
there
is
no
evidence
on
the
record
that
allocating
fabrication
expenses
on
the
basis
of
weight
is
in
fact
distortive
.
second
,
during
the
poi
,
kt
did
not
track
the
information
needed
to
allocate
fabrication
costs
on
the
basis
of
machine
time
.
third
,
the
department
has
accepted
weightbased
weight
based
allocations
of
these
costs
in
past
cases
involving
stainless
steel
pipe
.
accordingly
,
kt
argues
that
the
department
should
accept
its
allocation
of
fabrication
expenses
for
purposes
of
the
final
determination
.
doc
position
:
at
verification
,
we
determined
that
kt
accurately
reported
its
aggregate
fabrication
costs
during
the
poi
.
therefore
,
we
disagree
with
petitioners
that
kts
fabrication
costs
should
be
dismissed
for
purposes
of
the
final
determination
.
in
cases
where
machinery
or
processes
were
dedicated
to
the
production
of
specific
product
types
(
(
eg
,
wssp
,
kt
assigned
costs
directly
to
these
products
without
allocation
.
for
example
,
kt
assigned
depreciation
expenses
on
machinery
dedicated
to
the
production
of
wssp
directly
to
wssp
.
only
in
cases
where
kt
incurred
fabrication
costs
common
to
the
production
of
both
subject
and
nonsubject
subject
merchandise
did
kt
allocate
these
costs
.
we
recognize
that
kts
basis
for
the
allocation
of
these
costs
to
the
subject
merchandise
used
budgeted
estimates
which
kt
was
unable
to
reconcile
to
its
actual
production
experience
during
the
poi
.
however
,
we
found
at
verification
that
kt
did
not
maintain
the
level
of
detailed
records
in
its
normal
accounting
system
that
permitted
such
a
reconciliation
.
moreover
,
the
department
determined
that
these
estimates
are
reasonable
based
on
visual
inspection
of
the
production
process
and
analysis
of
kts
documentation
.
contrary
to
petitioners
'
assertions
,
during
the
poi
kt
did
not
maintain
its
records
at
a
sufficient
level
of
detail
to
perform
a
more
productspecific
product
specific
allocation
(
eg
,
records
of
machine
time
,
etc
.
accordingly
,
we
find
that
kts
allocation
methodology
is
reasonable
,
in
light
of
the
specific
circumstances
of
this
case
.
thus
,
we
have
accepted
the
use
of
kts
methodology
in
this
case
for
purposes
of
the
final
determination
.

:
petitioners
argue
that
kt
calculated
its
production
costs
on
the
basis
of
theoretical
production
weights
that
overstate
the
weight
of
finished
production
,
thus
artificially
lowering
its
submitted
per
unit
production
costs
.
therefore
,
petitioners
contend
that
the
cost
data
in
kts
09/13/1993
,
submission
is
unusable
and
should
be
rejected
by
the
department
.
kt
contends
that
the
use
of
theoretical
weights
does
not
affect
the
accuracy
of
its
submitted
production
costs
.
according
to
kt
,
since
kt
used
the
same
conversion
factor
for
its
calculation
to
convert
(
1
)
pipe
production
stated
in
feet
to
production
stated
in
kilograms
,
and
(
2
)
production
cost
per
kilogram
to
a
production
cost
per
foot
,
the
conversion
factors
are
uniformly
over
-
or
understated
under
stated
by
the
same
amount
.
doc
position
:
we
agree
with
kt
.
kts
calculation
of
theoretical
production
weights
overstates
the
actual
weight
of
production
during
the
poi
.
however
,
as
information
on
the
record
indicates
,
this
same
theoretical
production
weight
was
used
to
convert
the
production
costs
from
a
per
kilogram
cost
to
a
per
foot
cost
.
thus
,
the
effect
of
overstating
the
weight
of
production
is
offset
by
the
use
of
the
same
formula
in
converting
the
per
kilogram
cost
back
to
a
per
foot
cost
.
accordingly
,
no
adjustment
is
deemed
necessary
.

kt
contends
that
it
properly
reported
all
expenses
associated
with
management
and
financial
services
provided
to
kt
by
its
parent
as
part
of
its
submitted
gampa
.
kt
states
that
fees
for
these
services
are
charged
directly
to
kt
and
are
reflected
in
the
management
fee
amount
kts
parent
company
received
from
its
subsidiaries
in
fy
1993
.
according
to
kt
,
because
all
management
fees
that
are
properly
allocable
to
kt
are
already
charged
directly
to
the
company
,
there
is
no
basis
for
charging
any
additional
amount
to
kt
.
petitioners
contend
that
kt
understated
its
submitted
gampa
by
not
including
a
portion
of
its
parent
companys
expenses
incurred
during
1992
.
petitioners
argue
that
,
since
kts
parent
is
principally
an
investment
holding
company
,
all
gampa
incurred
by
the
parent
directly
relate
to
its
investment
holdings
.
petitioners
maintain
that
kts
claim
that
all
management
fees
and
financial
services
provided
by
its
parent
company
to
kt
are
accounted
for
in
its
submission
is
unverified
and
unsupported
.
according
to
petitioners
,
the
department
has
no
way
of
knowing
if
kts
management
fees
were
correctly
calculated
and
reported
.
additionally
,
petitioners
claim
that
the
department
should
increase
kts
submitted
gampa
by
the
omitted
amortization
of
preoperating
operating
expenses
as
noted
at
verification
.
