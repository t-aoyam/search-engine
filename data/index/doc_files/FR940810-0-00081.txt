however
,
a
wide
variety
of
power
tools
have
been
fitted
with
local
exhaust
systems
that
work
very
well
,
including
those
used
on
tools
for
asbestos
work
.
the
1972

required
the
use
of
local
exhaust
ventilation
on
all
handoperated
hand

tools
which

the

affirmed
the
requirement
for
ventilation
for
tools
(

.
we
again
reaffirm
it
here
.
to
the
extent
feasible
,
tools
used
for
working
with
acm
must
be
equipped
with
local
exhaust
ventilation

other
basic
controls
the
other
basic
controls
in
(

,
required
for
all
operations
under
the
standard
are
intended
to
reduce
exposure
caused
by
resuspension
of
asbestos
fibers
which
have
settled
.
the
first
is
the
requirement
in
(
g1i
)
to
use
vacuum
cleaners
equipped
with
hepa
filters
or
other
methods
to
collect
debris
and
visible
dust
containing
acm
or
pacm
before
the
material
dries
,
which
prevents
the
resuspension
of
fibers
.
this
requirement
complements
the
prohibition
in
(
g2iii
,
which
prohibits
dry
cleanup
clean
,
including
sweeping
and
shoveling
,
of
dust
and
debris
containing
acm
or
pacm
.
although
`
wet
'
sweeping
is
not
prohibited
,
it
is
not
preferred
,
and
may
not
be
used
to
`
collect
'
visible
dust
and
debris
.
nor
may
dry
acm
or
pacmcontaining
pacm
containing
dust
or
debris
be
collected
by
means
other
than
vacuuming
with
a
hepa
filtered
vacuum
.
there
was
substantial
record
support
for
these
requirements
.
as
noted
above
these
procedures
apply
to
all
asbestos
operations
.
in
removal
operations
,
the
requirement
to
use
wet
methods
in
the
removal
[
g1ii
]
will
help
assure
that
resulting
debris
and
dust
can
be
collected
before
they
dry
out
or
are
vacuumed
up
using
vacuums
equipped
with
hepa
filters
(
g1i
.
even
if
operations
are
conducted
within
negative
pressure
enclosures
,
debris
and
dust
should
not
remain
uncollected
for
the
entire
work
shift
,
because
the
resuspension
of
asbestos
fibers
from
these
sources
creates
additional
new
exposures
for
employees
.
if
the
work
is
performed
within
glove
bags
,
leaks
in
the
bags
may
create
dust
and
debris
.
fallen
debris
can
be
spread
to
parts
of
the
building
and
thereby
create
widespread
contamination
.
if
the
collection
bags
or
devices
required
by
other
provisions
fail
or
fall
short
,
prompt
collection
of
the
dust
and
debris
will
limit
the
exposure
to
workers
from
such
failure
.
if
the
negative
pressure
within
the
enclosure
lapses
,
prompt
collection
of
dust
and
debris
will
protect
employees
outside
the
enclosure
from
resuspended
fibers
.
for
these
reasons
,
osha
believes
that
careful
treatment
of
asbestos
waste
and
visible
dust
must
be
followed
in
all
construction
and
shipyard
industry
operations
which
expose
employees
to
asbestos
.
osha
notes
that
for
demolition
and
renovation
work
which
is
covered
under

,
all
acm
must
be
kept
wet
until
sealed
in
a

tight

which
includes
an
appropriate

osha
is
extending
this
requirement
to
all
jobs

now
requires
that
all

applies
to
situations

it
is

that

and
thus
additional

in

these

listed
as

they
are
now

because
of
their
proven

to
reduce

in

these

is
more
appropriate
