covered
by
the
earlier
standards

yet
the
coverage
was
incomplete

the

and
housekeeping
activities
were
also
included
in
the

standard
to
be

they
were

precautionary

to

addressed
in

osha
believes
that
the
switch
from
the
regulated
`
housekeeping
'
activities
to
the
class
iv
definition
is
clearer
and
reduces
loopholes
.
the
custodial
activities
covered
in
either
event
can
clearly
create
asbestos
dust
and
expose
custodial
employees
to
that
dust
.
data
in
the
record
show
that
custodial
activities
can
produce
not
insignificant
asbestos
exposure
levels
.
therefore
,
the
work
practices
required
to
reduce
that
dust
are
clearly
necessary
to
reduce
significant
risk
to
custodial
workers
.
by
establishing
a
class
iv
,
osha
is
rejecting
various
recommendations
that
some
activities
,
potentially
involving
asbestos
disturbance
,
would
result
in
de
minimis
risk
,
and
as
such
should
not
be
regulated

asbestos

there
was
overwhelming
support
for

for

which
would
be
consistent
with

.
the

communication
standard

require
labelling
of
materials
which
contain
more
than

as

osha
agrees
that
a
cutoff
of

is
appropriate
for
asbestos
containing

materials
and
has
included
this
value
in

is
the
term
used
in
the
regulatory

to

the
use
of

to

.
it
is
defined
as

'
oshas
intent
is
to
allow
data
reflecting
past
exposures
to
be
used
to
predict
current
exposures
only
when
the
conditions
of
the
earlier
job
were
not
more
protective
,
ie
,
employees
were
not

competent

osha
has
amended
the
definition
of
`
competent
person
'
in
the
construction
standard
and
included
it
in
the
shipyard
employment
standard
as
a
`
qualified

the
definition
is
based
on
the
definition
of

corrective
measures
to
eliminate
them
'
but
adds
a
specific
training
qualification
.
the

require
a

meets

requirements

subpart

.
osha
believes
that
specific
training
is
needed
so
a
`
competent
person
'
will
have
adequate
knowledge
to
perform
the
competent
persons
responsibilities
for
class
i
and
ii
work

a

training
as
developed
by

further
discussion
of
these
issues
is
found

in

document

the
revised
definition
deletes
from
the
definition
a
list
of
duties
to
be
performed
by
the
competent
person
.
duties
are
more
appropriately
set
out
in
other
regulatory
paragraphs
which
are
prescriptive
,
rather
than
in
the
`
definition
'
section
.
in
response
to
the
courts
remand
,
osha
has
also
expanded
the
scope
of
the
competent
personss
duties
so
that
a
competent
person
must
supervise
all
asbestos
activities
under
the
construction
standard
.
as
noted
,
these
requirements
are
set
forth
in
other
regulatory
paragraphs
which
govern
conditions
of
work
in
covered
activities
.
the
shipyard
employment
standard
does
not
use
the
term
`
competent
person
'
because
that
term
has
a
unique
definition
under
part
1915
.
osha
has
accepted
secsacs
recommendation
that
the
term
`
qualified
person
'
should
be
used
to
designate
a
person
with
the
same
duties
under
the
shipyard
employment
standard
