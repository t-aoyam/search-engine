(

,
fda
proposed
to
not

the
agency
tentatively
concluded
that
the
available
evidence
did
not
establish
that
the
standard
that
fda
had
proposed
for
health
claims
for
dietary
supplements
under
section

)
of
the

was
met
,
that
is
,
that
there
was
not
significant
scientific
agreement

based

available
scientific

that
the

is
valid

b
.
the
public
health
service
recommendations
in
09/19/1992
,
the
public
health
service
(
phs
)
issued
a
recommendation
that
all
women
of
childbearing
age
in
the
united
states
who
are
capable
of
becoming
pregnant
should
consume
04
milligram
(
mg
)
of
folic
acid
day
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
their
risk
of
having
a
pregnancy
affected
with
spina
bifida
or
other
ntds
.
the
recommendation
was
based
on
data
suggesting
that
folic
acid
,
when
given
at
a
high
dose
(
4
mg
,
can
reduce
the
risk
of
recurrence
of
ntds
and
on
a
synthesis
of
information
from
studies
that
used
multivitamins
containing
folic
acid
at
dose
levels
from
0
to
1000
micrograms
day
.
the
phs
recommendation
identified
approaches
and
identified
outstanding
issues
,
including
the
appropriate
intake
of
folate
,
the
potential
role
of
other
nutrients
in
reduction
of
risk
of

,
safety
concerns

the
dietary

act

in

this

imposed
a
moratorium
on
fdas
implementation
of
the
1990
amendments
with
respect
to
dietary
supplements
until
12/15/1993

the

directed
fda
to
issue
proposed
rules
to
implement
the
1990
amendments
with
respect
to

supplements
by
06/15/1993

did
not
meet

published
a

rule
to
not
authorize

however
,
the

reaffirmed
its
support
of
the
phs
recommendation
that
all
women
of
childbearing

in
the

who
are
capable

should

of

daily
to
reduce
their
risk
of
having
a
pregnancy
affected
with
spina

or
other
ntds
.
the
agency
noted
,
however
,
that
unresolved
questions
about
the
safe
use
of
folate
remained
.
the
agency
concluded
that
it
could
not
authorize
a
health
claim
until
these
questions
were
resolved
.
because
of
the

,
fda
took
no

(

relationship
between
folate
and

_

)
definition
.
.
neural
tube
defects
are
serious
birth
defects
of
the
brain
or
spinal
cord
that
can
result
in
infant
mortality
or
serious
disability
.
the
birth
defects
anencephaly
and
spina
bifida
are
the
most
common
forms
of
neural
tube
defects
and
account
for
about
90
percent
of
these
defects
.
these
defects
result
from
failure
of
closure
of
the
covering
of
the
brain
or
spinal
cord
during
early
embryonic
development
.
because
the
neural
tube
forms
and
closes
during
early
pregnancy
,
the
defect
may
occur
before
a
woman
realizes
that
she
is
pregnant
.
(

)
relationship
.
.
the
available
data
show
that
diets
adequate
in
folate
may
reduce
the
risk
of
neural
tube
defects
.
the
strongest
evidence
for
this
relationship
comes
from
an
intervention
study
by
the
medical
research
council
of
the
united
kingdom
that
showed
that
women
at
risk
of
recurrence
of
a
neural
tube
defect
pregnancy
who
consumed
a
supplement
containing
4
milligrams
(
mg
)
(
4000
micrograms
(
mug
)
folic
acid
daily
had
a
reduced
risk
of
having
a
child
with
a
neural
tube
defect
.
(
products
that
contain
this
level
of
folic
acid
are
drugs
)
in
addition
,
based
on
its
review
of
a
hungarian
intervention
trial
that
used
a
multivitamin
and
multimineral
preparation
containing
800
&
mug
(
08
mg
)
of
folic
acid
,
and
its
review
of
the
observational
studies
that
reported
use
of
multivitamins
containing
0
to
1000
&
mug
of
folic
acid
,
the
food
and
drug
administration
concluded
that
most
of
these
studies
had
results
consistent
with
the
conclusion
that
folate
,
at
levels
attainable
in
usual
diets
,
may
reduce
the
risk
of
neural
tube
defects
.

public

concern

.
neural
tube
defects
occur
in
approximately
06
of
1000
live
births
in
the
united
states
(
ie
,
about
2500
cases
among
4
million
live
births
annually
.
neural
tube
defects
are
believed
to
be
caused
by
many
factors
.
the
single
greatest
risk
factor
for
a
neural
tube
defectaffected
defect
affected
pregnancy
is
a
personal
or
family
history
of
a
pregnancy
affected
with
a
such
a
defect
.
however
,
about
90
percent
of
infants
with
a
neural
tube
defect
are
born
to
women
who
do
not
have
a
family
history
of
these
defects
.
the
available
evidence
shows
that
diets
adequate
in
folate
may
reduce
the
risk
of
neural

defects

not

effective
date

for
fortified
foods
,
this
regulation
is
effective
on
the
date
the
food
additive
regulation
on
the
use
of
folic
acid
that
was
proposed
on
10/14/1993
,
becomes
effective
.
the
1990
amendments
state
that
fda
is
to
promptly
publish
notice
of
the
new
status
of
the
proposed
regulations
in
the
federal
register
.
.
this
notice
is
issued
in
response
to
that
requirement
.
the
agency
emphasizes
,
however
,
that
this
regulation
is
deemed
to
be
a
final
regulation
only
with
respect
to
dietary
supplements
.
the
agency
notes
that
this
document
is
part
of
a
separate
rulemaking
contemplated
by
congress
if
the
final
regulation
was
not
issued
by
12/31/1993
.
this
rulemaking
bears
a
separate
docket
number
from
the
one
assigned
to
the
october
14
,
1993
rulemaking
to
distinguish
it
from
that
rulemaking
,
which
is
ongoing
.
the
agency
intends
to
continue
its
rulemaking
with
respect
to
folic
acid
and
neural
tube
defects
and
to
issue
a
final
rule
as
quickly
as
possible
.
in
this
regard
,
fda
recognizes
that
clarification
with
respect
to
the
legal
status
of
claims
about
folic
acid
and
ntds
on
foods
in
conventional
food
form
is
appropriate
.
fda
advises
that
,
given
the
phs
recommendation
and
the
results
of
fdas
preliminary
review
of
the
evidence
on
this
claim
,
at
this
time
it
has
no
intention
of
taking
action
against
foods
in
conventional
food
form
that
are
naturally
high
in
folate
that
bear
a
claim
on
this
nutrientdisease
nutrient
disease
relationship
,
so
long
as
the
claim
fully
complies
with
the
provisions
of
the
regulation
that
has
become
final
for
dietary
supplements
by
operation
of
law
.
however
,
for
foods
fortified
with
folic
acid
,
the
agency
has
more
significant
concerns
.
as
explained
in
the
health
claim
proposal
on
folic
acid
and
ntds
(
58
fr
53254
at
53288
)
and
the
proposal
to
amend
the
food
additive
regulation
on
folic
acid
that
published
in
the
federal
register
on
10/14/1993
(
58
fr
53312
,
there
appears
to
be
a
rather
narrow
range
of
safe
use
of
folic
acid
in
food
.
based
on
this
tentative
view
,
fda
would
be
very
concerned
,
at
least
until
it
reached
a
final
determination
in
those
proceedings
,
if
manufacturers
began
adding
folic
acid
to
their
products
,
or
increasing
the
amount
of
folic
acid
in
their
products
,
to
qualify
for
a
claim
.
therefore
,
fda
strongly
discourages
the
use
of
a
health
claim
about
folic
acid
and
ntds
on
any
such
fortified
products
pending
the
issuance
of
a
final
rule
on
this
nutrientdisease
nutrient
disease
relationship
.
as
stated
above
,
fda
intends
to
issue
a
final
rule
in
the
proceeding
on
a
health
claim
on
folic
acid
and
ntds
that
it
began
on
10/14/1993
,
in
the
near
future
.
fda
is
in
the
process
of
evaluating
the
comments
that
it
has
received
in
that
proceeding
,
including
the
results
of
an
advisory
committee
meeting
held
on
october
14
and
15
.
fda
will
attempt
to
resolve
the
issues
in
that
ongoing
proceeding
as
soon
as
possible
.
