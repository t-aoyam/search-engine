emission
limits
for
finishing
operations
.
there
are
four
methods
of
complying
with
the
finishing
material
emission
limits
in
the
proposed
rule
as
outlined
in
tables
3
and
5
.
these
include
an
averaging
approach
,
the
use
of
specific
compliant
materials
,
the
use
of
a
control
device
,
or
some
combination
of
compliant
materials
and
a
control
device
.
there
are
also
special
compliance
provisions
for
sources
using
a
compliant
coatings
approach
that
apply
coatings
using
continuous
coaters
.
an
owner
or
operator
that
chooses
the
averaging
approach
can
demonstrate
initial
compliance
by
recording
the
hap
and
solids
content
,
as
reported
on
the
certified
product
data
sheet
(
cpds
,
for
each
finishing
material
and
solvent
used
by
the
facility
in
finishing
operations
and
the
quantity
of
each
solvent
and
finishing
material
that
is
used
.
a
cpds
is
documentation
furnished
by
coating
suppliers
or
an
outside
laboratory
that
provides
the
hap
and
solids
content
of
the
finishing
material
(
or
adhesives
or
solvent
,
as
determined
using
the
epa
methods
311
and
24
,
respectively
.
the
epa
method
311
,
which
is
used
to
determine
the
hap
content
of
a
coating
or
solvent
,
is
being
proposed
with
this
rule
.
currently
,
the
method
is
only
applicable
for
volatile
haps
.
a
modified
version
of
the
test
method
is
being
developed
for
determining
the
hap
content
of
coatings
in
which
the
hap
is
used
as
a
reactive
diluent
or
the
hap
is
formed
and
emitted
during
the
curing
process
.
after
it
is
completed
,
the
modified
version
of
the
method
should
be
used
for
these
coatings
.
the
owner
or
operator
must
then
calculate
the
average
kg
vhap
kg
solids
(
lb
vhap
lb
solids
)
for
all
finishing
materials
,
as
applied
,
used
at
the
facility
using
equation
1
of
§
63
804
)
of
the
proposed
rule
.
initial
compliance
is
demonstrated
if
,
over
the
first
month
after
the
compliance
date
,
e
(
the
average
emission
limitation
achieved
by
the
emission
points
participating
in
the
averaging
approach
)
is
less
than
or
equal
to
1
kg
vhap
kg
solids
(
1
lb
vhap
lb
solids
)
for
existing
sources
or
08
kg
vhap
kg
solids
(
08
lb
vhap
lb
solids
)
for
new
sources
.
continuous
compliance
is
demonstrated
by
performing
the
same
averaging
calculation
over
each
and
every
subsequent
monthly
period
.
a
violation
of
the
monthly
average
would
be
considered
a
violation
for
each
operating
day
of
the
month
,
unless
the
affected
source
can
demonstrate
that
the
violation
of
the
monthly
average
can
be
attributed
to
a
particular
day
or
days
during
the
month
.
an
owner
or
operator
that
uses
compliant
finishing
materials
can
demonstrate
initial
and
ongoing
on
going
compliance
with
the
limits
for
affected
stains
,
washcoats
,
sealers
,
topcoats
,
basecoats
,
and
enamels
by
recording
the
hap
and
solids
content
,
as
reported
in
the
cpds
,
for
each
affected
stain
,
washcoat
,
sealer
,
topcoat
,
basecoat
,
and
enamel
used
by
the
facility
.
the
owner
or
operator
must
then
calculate
the
kg
vhap
kg
solids
(
lb
vhap
lb
solids
,
as
applied
,
for
each
of
these
materials
.
