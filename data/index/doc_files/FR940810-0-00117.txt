they
further
recommended
,
based
on
the
recent
developments
in
technology
that
the
use
of
test
chambers
,
and
the
requirement
for
use
of
aerosols
be
deleted
.
they
also
offered
an
additional
definition
:
`
challenge
agent
'
means
the
air
contaminant
,
or
parameter
,
which
is
measured
for
comparison
inside
and
outside
of
the
respirator
facepiece
'
these
are
reasonable
suggestions
,
but
as
they
have
general
application
outside
shipyards
,
osha
indicated
this
in
its
notice
of
february
5
,
1990
in
its
partial
response
to
the
court
.
the
agency
is
`
still
planning
to
revise
and
update
its
general
respiratory
standard
,
and
believes
that
continuing
to
enforce
the
current
asbestos
respirator
requirements
during
this
interim
period
will
not
expose
employees
to
unnecessary
risk

therefore
,
osha
will
not
delete
the
qualitative
fit
test
from
the
asbestos
standards
,
but
will
consider
the
issue
in
the
context
of
the
general
respiratory
standard

requirement

be

of
a

when
the

chooses

.
they
felt
that
the
employer
should
be
allowed
to
provide
an
airline

or

.
they
reasoned
that
most
employers
already
will
have
airline
respirators
in
stock
and
will
not
need
to
purchase
or
maintain
any
other
type
of
respirator
.
in
evaluating
similar
comments
in
the
rulemaking
for
the
1986
revised
asbestos
rule
,
osha
stated
:
osha
agrees
that
positivepressure
positive

suppliedair
supplied
air
respirators
provide
a
greater
level
of
protection
than
do
halfmask

respirators
.
osha
believes
that
employers
should
have
the
flexibility
to
use
any
of
the
available
respirators
that
provide
sufficient
protection
to
reduce
the
exposures
to
levels
below
the
pel
.
furthermore
,
the
safety
problems
associated
with
the
use
of
suppliedair
supplied
air
respirators
cannot
be
ignored
.
osha
believes
that
respirators
should
be
selected
that
both
provide
adequate
protection
from
exposure
to
airborne
asbestos
fibers
and
minimize
the
risk
of
accident
and
injury
potentially
caused
by
the
use
of
cumbersome

after
that
rulemaking
,
bctd
challenged
oshas
refusal
to
make
air
supplied
respirators
mandatory
.
the
court
accepted
oshas
explanationthat

supplied

respirators
had
hazards
of
its
own
,
and
stated
`
this
sort
of
judgment

(
is
)
within
oshas
discretion
in
the
absence
of
evidence
supporting
the
view
that
the
incremental
asbestos
safety
gains
plainly
exceed
the
incremental
nonasbestos
asbestos
hazards
'
(

at

.
osha
reiterated
these
reasons
in
its
01/28/1990
response
to
the
courts
remand
.
as
discussed
above
,
osha
has
determined
on
this
record
that
supplied
air
respirators
are
required
for
class
i
work
where
a
negative
exposure
assessment
is
not
forthcoming
,
but
not
for
other
class
i
work
.
therefore
,
shipyard
employees
doing
the
most
hazardous
work
must
wear
this
most
protective
respirator
as
well
