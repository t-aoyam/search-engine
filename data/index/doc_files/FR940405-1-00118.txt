provisions
which
address

believed
to

paragraph
(
d1
)
proposes
to
require
that
employers
operate
and
maintain
the
hvac
system
to
provide
at
least
the
minimum
outside
air
ventilation
rate
.
available
evidence
in
the
literature
supports
this
requirement
.
the
literature
which
supports
the
case
for
ventilation
with
outside
air
falls
into
two
categories
.
one
category
includes
case
studies
which
are
generated
when
iaq
complaints
require
onsite
on
site
responses
and
the
investigators
report
their
findings
through
iaq
forums
sponsored
by
professional
organizations
like
the
american
society
of
heating
,
refrigerating
and
airconditioning
air
conditioning
engineers
,
inc
.
and
the
american
industrial
hygiene
association
.
these
studies
report
that
the
lack
of
outside
ventilation
air
resulting
from
operational
or
maintenance
deficiencies
as
one
of
the
causes
of
iaq
complaints
.
many
of
the
studies
include
abatement
recommendations
to
ventilate
with
outside
air
as
feasible
per
the
original
design
intent
.
the
second
category
includes
research
projects
which
also
support
the
case
for
ventilating
buildings
with
at
least
the
recommended
minimum
of
outside
air
.
research
in
the
areas
of
ventilation
efficiency
,
tracer
gas
analysis
,
dilution
removal
of
internally
generated
contaminants
,
and
environmental
perceptions
mostly
support
this
contention
.
all
three
major
building
codes
in
the
united
states
which
are
used
in
the
design
of
new
and
retrofitted
facilities
mandate
minimum
outside
air
ventilation
rates
in
mechanicallyventilated
mechanically
ventilated
buildings
.
these
three
code
bodies
include
the
building
officials
and
code
administrators

,

(

the
international
conference
of

officials

(

per
section
102
of
the
1991
uniform
building
code
as
promulgated
by
the
icbo
,
the
purpose
of
the
building
code
is
`
to
offer
minimum
standards
to
safeguard
life
or
limb
,
health
,
property
and
public
welfare
by
regulating
and
controlling
the
design
,
construction
,
quality
of
materials
,
use
and
occupancy
*
*
*
*
*
.
clearly
,
there
is
a
significant
commitment
of
resources
by
these
code
bodies
to
offer
design
guidance
through
the
building
codes
to
designers
to
insure
that
a
facility
is
capable
of
delivering
a
minimum
amount
of
outside
air
to
its
'
occupants
.
this
concept
is
supported
by
the
efforts
of
plan
reviewers
and
building
inspectors
in
local
governmental
jurisdictions
throughout
the
united
states
who
ensure
that
facilities
are
constructed
per
the
building
codes
.
considering
the
upfront
front
efforts
of
these
code
officials
,
designers
,
and
construction
teams
,
it
is
reasonable
from
a
standpoint
of
continuity
,
to
require
that
buildings
be
operated
and
maintained
to
the
same
design
intent
.
this
provision
is
not
meant
to
require
rebuilding
or
retrofitting
hvac
systems
in
response
to
minor
work
.
for
example
,
such
steps
would
not
be
required
for
any
renovation
work
that
does
not
modify
the
buildings
configuration
or
the
conditions
that
would
be
affected
by
the
building
code
applicable
at
the
time
the
system
was
installed
or
last
modified
.
