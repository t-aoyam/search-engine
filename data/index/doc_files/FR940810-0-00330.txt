supplementary
information
:
on
03/10/1994
,
the
secretary
published
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
(
nprm
)
in
the
federal
register
(
59
fr
1144446
,
that
proposed
conditions
for
granting
exceptions
to
the
national
evaluation
standards
in
subpart
h
of
part
200
and
in
subpart
e
of
part
201
to
enable
states
that
are
implementing
new
assessment
systems
that
support
statewide
education
reform
to
use
those
assessmentsunder
less
prescriptive
national
standardsto
measure
the
effectiveness
of
their
chapter
1
and
mep
programs
.
under
the
nprm
,
the
secretary
could
have
approved
a
states
request
for
an
exception
to
the
generally
applicable
chapter
1
national
evaluation
standards
if
the
state
had
an
assessment
system
that
had
been
developed
to
support
the
states
education
reform
efforts
,
the
assessment
system
provided
information
about
the
yearly
performance
of
each
chapter
1
school
and
could
be
aggregated
for
the
lea
as
a
whole
,
and
that
information
was
from
at
least
one
grade
level
in
each
school
,
and
measured
student
achievement
in
basic
and
more
advanced
skills
and
challenging
subject
matter
.
the
same
standards
were
proposed
to
apply
to
the
mep
,
except
that
the
assessment
system
would
have
to
provide
a
statewide
estimate
of
the
yearly
performance
of
migratory
children
in
the
state
,
rather
than
information
on
individual
schools
.
the
nprm
also
proposed
to
permit
states
to
request
exceptions
for
particular
leas
and
operating
agencies
that
,
absent
state
systems
,
have
local
assessment
systems
in
place
that
support
their
education
reform
efforts
and
meet
these
same
standards
.
these
final
regulations
make
the
following
changes
to
the
nprm
.
most
significantly
,
§
200
90
)
and
201
57
)
have
been
revised
to
require
that
,
in
addition
to
the
conditions
in
the
nprm
,
a
state
assessment
system
for
which
an
exception
is
being
requested
(
1
)
must
yield
consistent
results
that
accurately
reflect
what
the
assessment
system
was
designed
to
measure
;
and
(
2
)
does
not
impair
an
seas
or
leas
ability
to
account
for
results
under
chapter
1
or
the
mep
.
the
secretary
has
added
these
standards
to
ensure
that
state
assessment
systems
being
developed
to
support
systemic
education
reform
efforts
are
of
high
quality
and
that
exceptions
under
these
regulations
would
only
be
granted
if
evaluation
results
provide
meaningful
indicators
about
the
effectiveness
of
chapter
1
and
mep
programs
.
in
addition
,
§
200
90
)
has
been
revised
to
make
clear
that
a
state
assessment
system
must
provide
information
from
at
least
one
grade
level
in
each
chapter
1
school
.
sections
200
90
)
and
201
57
)
have
also
been
revised
to
clarify
that
an
sea
may
seek
an
exception
for
leas
or
operating
agencies
that
have
assessment
systems
linked
to
local
reform
efforts
that
meet
the
same
standards
that
apply
to
state
assessment
systems
.
finally
,
§
200
80
)
has
been
revised
to
correct
an
erroneous
crossreference
cross
reference
.
these
regulations
support
the
efforts
of
those
states
that
will
be
voluntarily
implementing
reform
plans
under
the
goals
2000
:
educate
america
act
(
goals
2000
.
section
306c
)
of
goals
2000
requires
the
reform
plans
to
include
a
description
of
the
process
states
will
use
to
develop
state
assessments
aligned
with
the
states
content
standards
and
that
the
assessments
be
for
all
students
,
including
students
with
diverse
learning
needs
.
these
regulations
will
allow
states
that
have
assessment
systems
tied
to
statewide
education
reform
,
developed
under
goals
2000
or
another
reform
effort
,
to
avoid
duplication
by
using
their
statewide
assessments
for
chapter
1
and
mep
purposes
if
they
meet
less
prescriptive
national
standards
contained
in
these
regulations
.
