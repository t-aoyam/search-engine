fsis
believes
that
,
if
the
statistical
evidence
indicates
that
a
production
lot
is
not
in
compliance
with
the
calcium
requirement
,
the
lot
must
be
labeled
as
mss
)
and
meet
the
requirements
for
mss
)
in

cfr

.
in
this
situation
,
fsis
believes
that
the
process
is
out
of
control
,
and
there
is
the
likelihood
that
too
much
calcium
has
been
incorporated
in
the
recovered
meat
,
and
,
therefore
,
it
should
be
identified
as
mss
.
fsis
is
proposing
that
at
least
one
pound
of
product
be
sampled
each
week
during
production
of
a
lot
for
conformance
with
protein
quality
criteria
.
once
three
consecutive
results
from
3
production
lots
are
in
compliance
with
the
criteria
on
protein
quality
(
ie
,
a
protein
digestibilitycorrected
digestibility
corrected
amino
acid
score
or
essential
amino
acid
content
,
sampling
of
production
lots
can
be
reduced
to
a
monthly
basis
.
after
6
months
,
sampling
of
production
lots
can
be
reduced
to
a
quarterly
basis
.

this
sampling
schedule
ensures
the
statistical
representation
of
the
production
lots
is
achieved
in
regard
to
measuring
protein
quality
.

subsequently
,
if
samples
are
out
of
compliance
,
sampling
each
week
would
be
repeated
until
the
results
are
in
compliance
.
a
major
concern
of
fsis
is
the
assurance
that
consumers
receive
the
quality
of
meat
they
expect
in
terms
of
the
value
of
protein
needed
to
sustain
good
nutrition
.
therefore
,
fsis
is
proposing
that
product
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
recovery
systems
that
does
not
meet
the
requirements
of
the
criteria
for
protein
quality
must
be
identified
as
`

or

handling
requirements
.
fsis
is
proposing
to
specify
requirements
for
the
handling
of
material
that
is
to
be
processed
into
meat
derived
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
recovery
systems
and
for
handling
such
product
.
fsis
is
proposing
that
the
handling
of
such
material
comply
with
the
same
provisions
as
are
currently
prescribed
in
9
cfr
318
18
for
handling
material
for
mechanical
processing
.
fsis
believes
that
potential
bacterial
hazards
are
diminished
as
long
as
handling
accords
with
good
manufacturing
practices
.
because
meat
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
meat
recovery
systems
consists
of
particulates
of
muscle
tissue
having
more
surface
area
than
whole
muscle
cuts
,
there
is
a
greater
potential
for
bacterial
hazards
.
fsis
has
,
therefore
,
concluded
that
processing
and
storage
requirements
are
warranted
for
the
raw
materials
used
to
make
the
product
and
for
the
product
itself
.
fsis
is
proposing
to
adopt
the
handling
requirements
prescribed
in
9
cfr
318
18
.
these
requirements
would
provide
that
material
to
be
processed
into
meat
derived
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
meat
recovery
systems
be
processed
within
1
hour
from
the
time
it
is
cut
or
separated
from
livestock
carcasses
or
