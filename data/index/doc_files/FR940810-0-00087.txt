further
the
1990
proposal
specifically
focused
on
whether
work
within
walkin
walk
in
enclosures
was
the
optimum
method
to
protect
asbestos
workers
.
it
is
widely
accepted
that
employees
who
disturb
asbestos
,
and
who
contact
deteriorated
asbestos
during
their
work
are
most
at
risk

in
its
earlier
response
to
the
courts
remand
,
osha
noted
that
the
`
record
of
the
1986
standard
contains
no
data
concerning
whether
employees
working
within
the
negative
pressure
enclosures
also
benefit
from
reduced
exposure
,
whether
working
inside
enclosures
may
introduce
other
potential
work
hazards
such
as
heat
stress
.
further
rulemaking
is
necessary
to
develop
this
information

in
the
proposal
,
osha
reiterated
this
statement
and
again
raised
this
issue
(

.
the
rulemaking
record
reflected
this
twopart
two
part
inquiry
.
data
and
comment
were
submitted
concerning
the
effectiveness
of
npes
in
protecting
employees
within
the
enclosure
,
and
their
effectiveness
in
protecting
`
bystander
'
employees
and
adjacent
areas
from
asbestos
contamination
.
the
record
presents
a
mixed
case
on
both
issues
.
first
,
very
limited
data
were
submitted
showing
that
employees
working
within
the
enclosures
experienced
reduced
asbestos
levels
because
of
the
enclosures
themselves
,
or
the
ventilation
provided
by
negative
air
machines
,
in
spite
of
claims
that
the
enclosures
and
ventilation
produce
such
results
.
in
fact
claims
were
made
that
in
comparing
work
within
enclosures
to
work
without
enclosures
,
`
enclosures
consistently
came
out
higher
in
terms
of
what
the
person
inside
the
enclosure
is
exposed
to
'
(
exxon

.
however
,
the
record
contains
some
data
which
show
that
properly
designed
and
installed
npes
may
limit
the
spread
of
asbestos
contamination
to
adjacent
areas
and
employees
.
however
,
the
record
also
demonstrates
that
other
systems
,
properly
installed
and
performed
by
trained
employees
will
also
limit
the
spread
of
asbestos
contamination
.
these
are
discussed
in
depth
below
.
based
on
this
record
and
on
the
agencys
experience
and
expertise
,
osha
has
concluded
that
although
negative
pressure
enclosure
systems
are
effective
in
many
circumstances
in
protecting
workers
both
within
and
outside
the
enclosure
,
other
systems
are
equally
effective
in
designated
circumstances
.
additionally
,
the
demonstration
in
this
rulemaking
that
other
systems
can
be
effective
,
supports
regulatory
provisions
which
do
not
stifle
continued
development
and
refinement
of
control
strategies
for
asbestos
work
.

effectiveness
of
npes
in
protecting
employees
working
within
the
enclosure
as
noted
above
,
little
data
were
submitted
showing
that
employees
working
within
the
enclosure
have
reduced
exposures
because
of
the
enclosure
itself
,
or
other
components
of
the
npe
system
.
although
much
data
was
alluded
to
during
the
hearing
,
eg
,
`

however
,
none
of
these
data
was
submitted
to
the
record
.
also
,
niosh
testified
during
the
rulemaking
hearing
,
`
we
are
not
aware
of
any
studies
evaluating
their
(
negative

)
effectiveness
or
delineating
important
parameters
such
as
minimum

or
maximum

(

bctd
noted
a
study
in
which
`
two
mit
researchers
estimated
`
that
total
exposures
using
the
hepa
negative
pressure
system
might
be
about
fourfold
four
fold
less
than
they
would
be
without
the
system
'
(
ex

at

.
osha
notes
that
this
estimate
was
derived
from
`
assumptions
'
of
the
study
team
,
and
was
unsupported
by
exposure
data
.
further
,
the
baseline
exposure
model
was
based
on
a
much
earlier
study
of
activities
cleaning
up
contamination
in
a
building
.
during
this
rulemaking
hearing
,
the
author
of
that
study
described
it
as
`
extremely
unique
,

*
*
*
not
representative
of
buildings
in
the
united
states
'
(

.
osha
therefore
regards
the
mit
exposure
reduction
estimate
as
unsupported
and
too
speculative
to
serve
as
a
basis
for
regulatory
decision
making
.
exposure
data
submitted
to
this
rulemaking
record
which
reflected
personal
samples
within
negative
pressure
enclosures
do
not
support
the
view
that
working
within
such
enclosures
by
itself
will
ensure
reduced
employee
exposure
.
in
fact
,
data
were
submitted
which
showed
that
employees
working
within
negative
pressure
enclosures
under
some
circumstances
were
exposed
to
excessive
levels
of
asbestos
(
see
below
.
osha
recognizes
that
a
showing
of
elevated
levels
from
any
one
project
or
series
of
projects
does
not
indict
the
control
method
as
the
cause
of
such
elevations
.
however
,
numerous
submissions
from
various
sources
which
show
elevated
exposure
levels
with
no
indication
of
improper
system
installation
indicates
that
in
operation
,
the
use
of
negative
pressure
enclosure
systems
does
not
assure
effective
exposure
reduction
to
the
employees
performing
the
work
.
