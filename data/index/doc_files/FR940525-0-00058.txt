there
is
a
band
outside
the
midcoast
mid
coast
closure
area
that
encompasses
jeffreys
ledge
and
is
described
relative
to
the
mid

area
as

to
the
shore
.
according
to
the
sea
sampling
data
base
,
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
in
this
band
has
been
relatively
high
during
the
last
3
years
.
concerns
focus
on
whether
a
displacement
of
more
fishing
effort
into
this
region
might
account
for
a
kill
rate
as
high
as
or
potentially
higher
than
in
previous
years
.
under
provisions
of
this
final
rule
,
the
band
will
remain
open
,
but
the
council
recommended
mandatory
observer
coverage
for
vessels
fishing
in
the
area
if
funds
are
available
.

open
areas
:
areas
shown
on
figure

to

,
but
not
enclosed
by
the
boundary
lines
described
above
,
would
not
be
subject
to
closure
at
this
time
.
the
council
program
calls
for
a
20percent
percent
reduction
in
the
gulf
of
maine
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
in
year
1
of
implementation
of
amendment
5
.
to
ensure
continued
efforts
to
reduce
the
bycatch
,
amendment
5
states
that
a
harbor
porpoise
review
team
(
hprt
,
appointed
by
the
council
,
will
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
the
councils
mitigation
measures
annually
by
september
15
of
each
year
and
,
if
necessary
,
recommend
changes
to
ensure
that
the
bycatch
reduction
goals
are
met
.
future
management
measures
will
be
designed
to
achieve
a
60percent
percent
reduction
in
the
bycatch
of
harbor
porpoise
from
current
levels
over
a
3year
year
period
.
based
on
a
bycatch
of
1300
animals
(
a
figure
that
constitutes
a
rough
average
of
the
bycatch
estimates
over
the
last
2
years
,
the
bycatch
in
years
1
,
2
,
and
3
would
be
reduced
to
1040
,
780
,
and
520
animals
,
respectively
.
such
a
reduction
schedule
might
surpass
the
goal
of
reducing
the
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
to
a
level
not
to
exceed
2
percent
of
the
estimates
of
population
abundance
and
bycatch
(
39500
and
approximately
1300
,
respectively
.
the
use
of
the
lower
bound
of
the
95percent
percent
confidence
interval
for
the
abundance
estimate
,
39500
,
adds
a
level
of
conservatism
that
in
part
addresses
the
problem
of
the
confidence
intervals
surrounding
the
bycatch
estimates
.
as
previously
discussed
,
the
entire
2
percent
bycatch
cannot
be
allocated
solely
to
the
gulf
of
maine
sink
gillnet
fleet
.
a
specific
target
for
year
4
will
be
established
by
the
hprt
after
consideration
of
previous
targets
not
met
in
any
given
year
or
because
of
possible
increased
bycatch
reductions
required
by
the
1994
amendments
to
the
marine
mammal
protection
act
.
for
example
,
if
the
20
percent
target
is
missed
in
any
of
the
first
three
years
,
the
fourth
year
allows
the
flexibility
to
add
that
portion
of
the
target
reductions
not
achieved
in
any
of
the
first
three
years
to
be
deferred
until
the
next
year
or
until
year
four
of
the
program
.
the
year4
year
target
,
however
,
cannot
exceed
20
percent
of
the
total
reduction
required
over
the
entire
4year
year
period
.

,
for
the
purpose

plan
.
for

,
the
