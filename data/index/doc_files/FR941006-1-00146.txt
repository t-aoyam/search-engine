review
of
consumer
education
issues
in
citizen
petitions
two
of
the
three
petitions
submitted
discussed
the
benefits
of
educational
efforts
for
the
public
and
health
professionals
,
focusing
on
the
prevention
of
accidental
pediatric
iron
poisoning
.
the
aapcc
petition
and
the
ndma
petition
advocated
educational
efforts
and
outlined
specific
actions
as
described
herein
.
a
.
the
aapcc
petition
.
the
aapcc
petition
called
for
the
initiation
of
an
fda
educational
campaign
for
four
different
segments
of
the
population
.
the
four
target
segments
are
:
(
1
)
parents
,
babysitters
,
daycare
providers
,
and
other
consumers
;
(
2
)
pediatricians
;
(
3
)
obstetricians
;
and
(
4
)
other
health
professionals
such
as
physicians
,
others
who
can
prescribe
iron
,
and
pharmacists
.
the
petition
suggested
that
pediatricians
discuss
the
dangers
of
an
iron
overdose
with
parents
at
the
6month
month
checkup
,
and
that
obstetricians
inform
mothers
at
the
final
postpartum
checkup
.
b
.
the
ndma
petition
.
in
the
fall
of
1993
,
ndma
in
cooperation
with
cpsc
,
developed
and
launched
a
national
consumer
education
campaign
to
be
carried
out
in
conjunction
with
the
voluntary
labeling
and
packaging
measures
(
described
above
in
section
id
.
of
this
document
)
that
were
undertaken
by
the
members
of
ndma
and
nnfa
.
the
purpose
of
the
campaign
,
as
stated
in
the
petition
,
is
to
inform
adults
about
how
to
protect
children
from
accidental
iron
poisoning
.
the
three
major
themes
of
the
educational
campaign
mirror
some
of
the
messages
in
ndmas
and
nnfas
voluntary
warning
statements
for
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
and
are
as
follows
:
(
1
)
adult
awareness
of
the
dangers
to
children
if
iron
is
accidentally
swallowed
in
excess
,
(

)
reclose
the
childresistant
child
resistant
package
after
every
use
,
and
,
(
3
)
keep
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
out
of
the
reach
of
children
.
ndma
and
cpsc
began
the
educational
campaign
by
distributing
video
and
print
news
releases
,
radio
news
releases
in
english
and
spanish
,
and
public
service
announcements
emphasizing
the
threepronged
three
pronged
message
.
the
public
service
announcements
are
also
being
sent
to
consumer
,
health
,
and
womens
magazines
.

agency
response
fda
agrees
with
the
petitioners
that
the
public
needs
to
be
informed
of
the
dangers
of
pediatric
iron
poisoning
through
public
education
efforts
.
such
efforts
can
be
one
important
element
in
combating
a
cause
of
injury
and
deaths
that
has
affected
thousands
of
children
over
the
last
approximately
10
years
.
thus
,
fda
commends
ndma
and
cpsc
for
their
joint
efforts
in
developing
and
distributing
a
national
educational
campaign
targeting
accidental
iron
poisoning
,
to
coincide
with
the
voluntary
packaging
and
labeling
measures
for
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
that
have
been
undertaken
by
the
members
of
ndma
and
nnfa
.
fda
believes
that
the
themes
of
this
campaign
are
appropriate
and
are
responsive
to
a
fundamental
need
that
exists
for
more
awareness
among
adults
of
the
dangers
of
pediatric
iron
poisoning
and
of
the
means
to
prevent
these
poisonings
.
because
of
the
seriousness
of
the
problem
,
ie
,
accidental
iron
ingestion
is
the
leading
cause
of
poisoning
deaths
among
children
,
fda
intends
to
contribute
to
educating
the
public
.
accordingly
,
fda
is
developing
materials
for
a
public
information
campaign
that
would
address
aapccs
request
and
complement
ndma
and
cpscs
educational
efforts
by
emphasizing
the
same
awareness
and
prevention
elements
as
the
ndma
cpsc
campaign
,
as
follows
:
(
1
)
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
can
seriously
injure
or
even
kill
young
children
who
accidentally
swallow
them
.
(

)
reclose
the
childresistant
child
resistant
package
completely
and
every
time
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
are
opened
.
(

)
keep
all
containers
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
out
of
reach
of
children
all
the
time
.
fdas
campaign
will
also
address
steps
that
should
be
taken
by
adults
if
an
accidental
ingestion
of
iron
occurs
:
(

)
when
children
accidentally
ingest
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
,
the
attending
person
should
quickly
call
a
poison
control
center
and
follow
their
instructions
,
or
take
the
child
to
an
emergency
room
.
(

)
although
the
first
symptoms
,
vomiting
and
diarrhea
,
may
occur
within
30
minutes
,
and
these
symptoms
may
be
followed
by
an
appearance
of
recovery
,
the
child
may
still
be
in
danger
.
therefore
,
immediate
professional
consultation
is
critical
.
the
fda
materials
will
include
print
pieces
available
for
distribution
to
different

this
message
.
the

message
in
a
simple
and
concise
manner
for
use
in
the
home
by
