based
on
information
in
the
record
and
in
oshas
inspection
files
,
osha
observes
that
many
construction
employers
currently
apply
these
controls
in
varied
combinations
and
at
varied
levels
of
utilization
.
osha
estimated
that
for
construction
employers
,
rates
of
current
compliance
range
from
roughly
20
percent
to
80
percent
,
depending
on
the
control
requirement
and
construction
activity
.
therefore
,
osha
believes
all
controls
are
technologically
feasible
for
the
appropriate
construction
activities
.
in
conclusion
,
therefore
,
osha
projects
that
the
final
revisions
to
the
asbestos
construction
standard
will
be
technologically
feasible
because
all
of
the
provisions
,
including
the
lowered

can
be
met
using
existing
engineering
controls

respiratory

.
historically
,
exposure
to
asbestos
in
shipyards
took
place
during
shipbuilding
and
ship
repair
.
at
present
,
the
majority
of
asbestos
activity
aboard
maritime
vessels
involves
repair
and
maintenance
of
machinery
and
plumbing
with
asbestos
insulation
.
in
this
final
rulemaking
,
the
revised
asbestos
standard
for

,

,
applies
most
of

,
to
