this
represents
a
significant
change
from
past
practices
.
when
pipelines
were
the
primary
merchants
in
the
interstate
marketplace
,
merchant
services
were
provided
under
longterm
long
term
contracts
on
an
`
on
demand
'
basis
.
while
the
pipelines
had
all
of
the
industrys
information
available
to
them
,
and
operational
control
over
all
of
the
functions
,
this
information
was
aggregated
over
both
time
(
monthly
)
and
markets
.
increasingly
,
todays
merchant
services
focus
on
individual
customers
and
are
adjustable
on
a
daily
or
even
hourly
basis
.
the
information
needed
to
drive
the
oldstyle
old
style
merchant
services
is
neither
compatible
with
nor
sufficient
to
meet
the
demands
of
todays
marketplace
.
second
,
all
future
sales
of
gas
will
take
place
at
pipeline
receipt
or
pooling
points
.
this
requires
that
the
pipeline
,
acting
as
a
merchant
,
and
the
pipelines
marketing
affiliates
must
sell
gas
at
the
same
point
on
the
system
as
other
gas
sellers
.
this
places
all
other
natural
gas
sellers
on
a
level
playing
field
with
marketing
affiliates
and
the
pipeline
as
a
merchant
.
and
because
the
commission
has
mandated
that
pipelines
allow
all
shippers
flexible
receipt
,
pooling
,
and
delivery
point
authority
,
all
shippers
should
have
equal
access
to
available
capacity
throughout
the
system
.
the
designation
of
pooling
points
,
the
pipelines
point
of
sale
for
merchant
services
,
and
the
terms
and
conditions
governing
flexible
point
authority
are
all
subject
to
negotiations
among
the
pipeline
and
the
parties
in
individual
restructuring
proceedingsnot
subject
to
the
pipelines
sole
discretion
to
decide
.
the
result
of
negotiations
over
these
significant
operating
terms
and
conditions
must
ultimately
be
filed
by
the
pipelines
as
part
of
their
ferc
tariffs
and
apply
equitably
to
all
shippers
whether
they
purchase
from
the
pipeline
or
anyone
else
.
third
,
pipelines
are
encouraged
in
the
order
no
.
636
restructuring
process
to
minimize
transition
costs
by
assigningon
a

supply
contracts
to
their
former
sales
customers
.
pipelines
are
also
allowed
100
percent
recovery
of
transition
costs
.
these
transition
provisions
are
designed
to
fairly
distribute
the
burden
of
the
historic
legacy
of
uncompetitive
pipeline
purchase
arrangements
.
coupled
with
removal
of
burdensome
regulatory
pricing
structures
,
pipeline
merchant
function
operating
units
should
be
left
in
a
position
to
compete
fairly
with
other
merchants
without
being
saddled
with
the
costs
of
uncompetitive
purchase
contracts
.
fourth
,
order
no
.
636
requires
pipelines
to
establish
and
maintain
ebbs
and
requires
that
ebb
personnel
function
independently
of
the
gas
marketing
personnel
to
the
maximum
extent
practicable
.
identification
of
some
of
the
data
to
be
maintained
on
the
ebb
is
the
subject
of
negotiation
between
the
pipeline
and
the
parties
to
the
restructuring
proceedings
.
however
,
other
data
are
required
by
order
no
.
636
to
be
on
the
ebb
at
all
times
,
eg
,
length
of
release
,
rate
,
quantity
,
criteria
for
bid
evaluation
(
which
criteria
was
determined
during
the
restructuring
proceeding
)
and
the
pipeline
must
identify
all
capacity
on
its
system
which
is
available
directly
from
the
pipeline
.
implementation
of
these
ebbs
will
give
all
shippers
and
potential
shippers
instant
access
to
the
most
current
information
about
the
availability
of
pipeline
capacity
.
finally
,
order
no
.
636
creates
a
capacity
releasing
program
.
under
this
program
,
firm
shippers
of
the
pipeline
are
allowed
to
resell
their
capacity
,
in
whole
or
in
part
,
and
under
terms
and
conditions
they
choose
,
to
the
highest
bidding
replacement
shipper
.
releasing
shippers
are
also
allowed
to
include
specific
provisions
for
the
recall
of
released
capacity
,
eg
,
when
temperatures
drop
below
a
preset
set
minimum
level
.
releases
may
be
either
permanent
or
temporary
,
firm
or
interruptible
.
coupled
with
flexible
receipt
and
delivery
point
authority
,
the
capacity
release
program
will
allow
existing
firm
shippers
to
sell
their
capacity
in
the
pipeline
to
others
.
this
will
create
competition
for
capacity
against
the
pipeline
itself
.
although
the
pipeline
would
continue
to
operate
the
system
,
it
would
no
longer
be
in
sole
control
over
who
has
access
to
capacity
.
again
,
the
pipelines
and
their
shippers
are
expected
to
work
together
in
implementing
the
order
no
.
636
restructuring
process
to
decide
how
the
pipeline
will
operate
in
the
new
unbundled
world
.
with
respect
to
northwests
request
,
the
commission
clarifies
that
it
will
not
apply
standard
(
f
)
to
any
conduct
regarding
sales
or
marketing
information
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
order
no
.
