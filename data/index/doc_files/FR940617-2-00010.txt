scope

the
merchandise

this

is
silicomanganese
.
silicomanganese
,
which
is
sometimes
called
ferrosilicon
manganese
,
is
a
ferroalloy
composed
principally
of
manganese
,
silicon
,
and
iron
,
and
normally
containing
much
smaller
proportions
of
minor
elements
,
such
as
carbon
,
phosphorous
and
sulfur
.
silicomanganese
generally
contains
by
weight
not
less
than
4
%
iron
,
more
than
30
%
manganese
,
more
than
8
%
silicon
and
not
more
than
3
%
phosphorous
.
all
compositions
,
forms
and
sizes
of
silicomanganese
are
included
within
the
scope
of
this
investigation
,
including
silicomanganese
slag
,
fines

briquettes

silicomanganese
is
used
primarily
in
steel
production
as
a
source
of
both
silicon
and
manganese
.
this
investigation
covers
all
silicomanganese

regardless
of
its
