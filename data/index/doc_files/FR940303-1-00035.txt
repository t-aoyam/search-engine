background
introduction
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
are
characteristically
finely
comminuted
(
ie
,
finely
ground
)
in
form
and
result
from
the
mechanical
separation
and
removal
of
most
of
the
bone
from
attached
skeletal
muscle
and
other
tissue
of
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
.
the
products
are
prepared
from
various
materials
,
including
necks
,
backs
,
and
whole
carcasses
.
these
starting
materials
may
be
raw
or
cooked
,
may
contain
varying
amounts
of
muscle
and
or
skin
,
and
may
contain
kidneys
,
except
when
product
is
made
from
mature
chickens
or
mature
turkeys
.
kidneys
of
mature
chickens
or
turkeys
may
not
be
used
as
human
food

the
technology
to
mechanically
separate
and
remove
most
of
the
bone
from
attached
skeletal
muscle
and
other
tissue
of
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
began
in
the
late
1950s
or
early
1960s
.
the
departments
initial
reaction
was
to
consider
the
resulting
product
adulterated
because
of
the
amount
of
bone
present
and
the
physical
size
of
the
bone
particles
.
by
the
mid1960s
mid
,
the
industry
had
modified
and
improved
the
equipment
used
to
produce
poultry
product
by
mechanical
deboning
such
that
product
contained
less
than
11/2
percent
bone
solids
with
an
extremely
small
bone
particle
size
.
this
prompted
the
department
to
reevaluate
its
position
.
widespread
commercial
production
of
products
containing
mechanically
deboned
poultry
began
in
the
early
1970s
.
by
1975
,
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
was
being
used
as
an
ingredient
in
poultry
and
meat
food
products
such
as
franks
,
bologna
,
salami
,
and
rolls
.
today
,
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
are
used
in
a
wide
variety
of
poultry
products
,
including
cooked
poultry
sausages
(
such
as
chicken
frankfurters
,
turkey
salami
,
and
turkey
bologna
,
poultry
patties
and
nuggets
(
such
as
chicken
patties
and
nuggets
,
and
poultry
baby
foods
.
the
level
at
which
it
is
used
has
depended
in
part
on
technological
capabilities
and
has
reached
100
percent
of
the
poultry
product
portion
of
a
number
of
cooked
poultry
sausage
products
.
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
means
is
also
used
at
up
to
49
percent
of
the
formulations
of
certain
meat
food
products
,
eg
,
beef
and
turkey
chili
,
provided
that
it
is
identified
in
the
product
name
as
`
turkey
'
`
chicken
'
etc
,
and
used
in
meat
food
products
including
cooked
sausages
,
such
as
frankfurters
and
bologna
,
at
a
level
of
up
to
15
percent
of
the
total

over
the
years
,
the
poultry
and

in
1976
,
the
department
initiated
an
analytical
program
to
obtain
data
on
a
number
of
nutrients
and
substances
of
potential
health
concern
in
poultry

data
were
also
gathered
from

literature

industry
,
other
government
agencies

scientists
.
details
of
the
analytical
program
and
a
resulting
evaluation
were
published
in
a

report
entitled
