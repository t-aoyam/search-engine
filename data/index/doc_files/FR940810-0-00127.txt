during

rulemaking

participants
raised
various
issues
concerning
notification

several
participants
wanted
accessibility
to
be
a
consideration
in
the
approach

that

be

most
agreed
that
pacm

acm
within
areas
such
as
mechanical
rooms

boiler
rooms
should
be
labeled

for
example
,
mr

olson
of
dow
chemical
company
supported
the
posting
of
areas
where
those
who
may
be
exposed
will
see
it
before
working
there
(

a
representative
from
the
department
of
defense
felt
that
general
posting
in
public
areas
would
alarm
building
occupants
and
over
time
,
lead
to
reduced
credibility
and
effectiveness

this
was
echoed
in
the
comments

who
felt
that
signs
`
may
breed

(

one
participant
worried
that
perhaps
a
tenant
considering

requires

be
attached

'
osha
agrees
with
bctds
definition
as
well
.
some
representatives
of
contractor
interests
recommended
that
osha
use
as
a
model
for
notification
the
california
regulation
by
which
the
building
owner
provides
written
notification
to
all
building
employees
,
tenants
,
and
contractors
(
exs
.
16227
,
16232
.
as
noted
below
,
paragraph
(
k7vii
)
requires
previously
installed
asbestos
products
to
be
labelled
in
most
circumstances
;
either
visibly
labeled
in
accordance
with
the
standard
,
when
feasible
,
or
that
information
required
on
the
label
be
posted
as
close
to
the
installed
product
as
feasible
.
information
concerning
other
previouslyinstalled
previously
installed
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
products
must
be
posted
in
mechanical
rooms
or
other
areas
which
are
accessible
where
such
material
is
present
;
or
if
the
products
are
installed
in
other
areas
,
the
building
owner
must
otherwise
make
such
information
available
to
employees
who
perform
work
covered
by
this
standard
.
the
provision
exempts
from
labeling
and
posting
those
products
which
the
manufacturer
demonstrates
cannot
release
fibers
in
excess
of
the
pels
.
osha
has
found
that
this
exemption
will
never
apply
to
pacm
(
tsi
or
surfacing
acm
;
rarely
will
it
apply
to
other
asbestos
containing
materials
,
because
on
this
record
,
disturbance
of
acm
can
exceed
the
pel
.
as
noted
in
the
comments
summarized
above
,
there
will
be
cases
where
labeling
of
such
materials
is
not
feasible
.
in
such
case
,
the
standard
requires
that
signs
or
labels
be
displayed
as
close
as
feasible
to
such
materials
.
additionally
,
housekeeping
workers
must
be
informed
that
all
resilient
flooring
material
they
clean
,
buff
or
otherwise
maintain
may
contain
asbestos
.
osha
believes
that
the
strategy
for
the
flow
of
information
regarding
the
presence
and
location
of
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
or
presumeasbestoscontaining
presume
asbestos
containing
materials
it
has
developed
in
this
revision
of
its
standards
will
assure
that
workers
who
might
be
exposed
to
asbestos
within
public
and
commercial
buildings
and
or
facilities
will
be
informed
of
the
potential
for
such
exposure
and
through
the
training
provisions
will
be
made
aware
of
the
practices
they
are
to
use
to
avoid
exposure
.
to
further
assure
the
responsible
transfer
of
information
,
osha
is
requiring
that
records
of
the
work
performed
,
the
location
and
quantity
of
acm
or
pacm
remaining
at
the
completion
of
the
work
,
and
data
supporting
any
rebuttal
of
the
presumption
that
a
material
contains
asbestos
,
are
to
be
maintained
by
the
building
facility
owner
and
are
to
be
transferred
to
successive
owners
of
the
building
facility
.
further
,
in
the
event
that
acm
pacm
is
inadvertently
encountered
,
osha
has
included
a
requirement
for
timely
notification
.
if
during
the
course
of
asbestos
work
acm
or
pacm
is
discovered
at
a
worksite
,
within
24
hours
of
finding
such
material
,
information
as
to
its
location
and
quantity
are
to
be
conveyed
to
the
building
owner
and
any
other
employers
at
the
site
