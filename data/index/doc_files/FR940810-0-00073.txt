although

the

to
determine
when
a

could
be
reoccupied
following

in

a

felt
that

that
it

in

and
a
representative

pointed
out
that
a

are
not
the

as

the
submission
of

expressed
their
desire
that
osha
not

(

osha
has
not
included
a
provision
for
a
specific
`
clearance
level
'
in
these
revised
standards
.
in
reviewing
the
record
,
there
is
no
clear
evidence
of
a
linkage
between
such
a

designation
of
a

level

the

contains
some
data
indicating
that
attainment
of
a
clearance
level
(
either
background
or
0

does
not
conclusively
predict
fiber
levels
which
will
occur
in
formerly
regulated
areas
(
ex

123
,
16219
.
therefore
,
osha
has
not
included
a
quantitative
cutoff
to
determine
whether
a
work
area
has
been
adequately
cleaned
to
allow
reentry
entry
,
rather
the
standards
now
require
that
the
information
regarding
the
final
monitoring
of
the
prior
work
be
provided
to
those
reoccupying
the
area
.
however
,
osha
recognizes
the
need
for
adequate
cleaning
of
the
worksite
following

osha
proposed
several
changes
to
the
methods
of

provisions
.
one
was
to
require
specific
work
practice
and
engineering
controls
for

another
was
to
regulate
the
maintenance
of

asbestos
containing

by
prohibiting
certain
kinds
of
work
practices
and
requiring
others
;
the
third
was
to
require
that

and
work

the
newly
reduced

the
