as
discussed
above
,
the
negative
pressure
enclosure
requirement
in
the
1986
standard
lacked
specificity
.

recommended
that
osha
specify
the
number
of

per

required
in
the
negative

enclosure

would

`

in

expressed
their

suggested

be
made

the
use
of

measure
the

differential
between

enclosure
and
the
area
outside
the
enclosure
was
also
supported
by
bctd
and
dangelo

spicer
primarily
because
this
device
would
provide
immediate
notice
if
there
were
a
loss
of

and
therefore
increased
potential
for

bctd
submitted
additional
recommendations
which
it
felt
would
improve
negative
pressure
enclosure
use
:
_
use
additional
air
filtration
machines
in
areas
of
especially
high
fiber
concentrations
,
to
serve

'
_
use
at

_
provide
an
independent

_
prefilter

(

)
most
of
these
recommendations
appear
to
be
beneficial
.
requiring
smoke
testing
to
detect
leaks
is
adopted
by
the
agency
as
part
of
required
setup
set
procedures
when
such
enclosures
are
used
.
others
,
such
as
requiring
`
additional
air
filtration
machines
*
*
*
*
*
*
where
exposures
are
especially
high
'
appear
to
be
sound
engineering
advice
but
would
present
enforcement
problems
,
if
included
in
the
regulatory
text
(
ex
.
143
.
instead
,
as
part
of
the
mandatory
criteria
for
npes
,
when
used
to
control
exposure
in
class
i
jobs
,
the
agency
is
requiring
`
competent
persons
'
to
oversee
the
installation
of
such
systems
,
and
employees
to
be
protected
within
such
enclosures
by
ventilation
systems
which
minimize
their
asbestos
exposure
.
osha
believes
that
its
provisions
on
negative
pressure
systems
will
protect
employees
working
within
them
.
based
on
the
above
extensive
analysis
of
the
many
studies
and
comments
,
osha
has
concluded
that
npes
are
not
appropriate
as
a
universal
requirement
.
they
usually
protect
bystanders
well
,
but
not
always
workers
within
the
enclosures
,
and
can
sometimes
create
other
problems
.
consequently
,
osha
is
permitting
alternatives
to
npes
in
appropriate
circumstances
and
is
upgrading
requirements
for
npes
when
they
are
used
.
also
,
osha
believes
that
various
alternative
requirements
in
this
final
revised
standard
triggered
by
class
i
,
ii
,
and
iii
work
,
some
of
which
are
components
of
negative
pressure
systems
will
protect
adjacent
or
`
bystander
'
employees
under
most
situations
.
thus
,
mandatory
critical
barriers
for
most
class
i
,
some
class
ii
and
iii
work
will
bar
passage
of
fugitive
asbestos
fibers
;
and
,

the
responsibilities
of
the
various
employers
on
a

will

what
other
control
systems
can
be
allowed
for
asbestos
work
which
involves
high
risk
materials
?
osha
is
allowing
other
control
systems
for
category
i
asbestos
work
,
but
only
under
stated
conditions
.
thus
,
the
second
asbestos
control
system
permitted
for
use
for
category
i
asbestos
work
is
a
glove
bag
system
which
meets
the
requirements
of
the
standard
,
and
is
used
only
in
the
limited
situations
listed
in
paragraph
(

recommended
by
the

or

based
on

showing
their
effectiveness
may
also
be
used
.
whenever
a
technology
is
used
which
is
not
referenced
in
the
standards
,
the
employer
must
notify
osha
before
the
asbestos
job
,
and
include
in
the
notification

basis

that
the

as

glove
bag
systems
the
decision
to
allow
increased
glove
bag
use
is
based
on
the
considerable
comment
and
evidence
submitted
during
this
proceeding
concerning
the
safety
and
effectiveness
of
glove
bag
use
.
osha
had
proposed
to
permit
only
smallscale
small
scale
,
short
duration
removals
to
be
conducted
using
glove
bags
;
however
the
agency
noted
that
it
was
considering
whether
alternatives
,
including
glove
bags
,
to
negative
pressure
enclosures
for
renovation
,
removal
and
demolition
operations
should
be
allowed
(
55
fr
at
29716
.
in
the
1986
standard
,
glove
bag
effectiveness
was
considered
too
uncertain
to
allow
as
a
preferred
control
.
therefore
osha
relegated
glove
bag
use
to
smallscale
small
scale
,
short
duration
jobs
,
or
jobs
exempt
from
the
negative
pressure
enclosure
requirement
because
of
the
configuration
of
the
work
environment
.
however
osha
noted
that
glove
bag
use
could
generally
be
expected
to
reduce
exposures
to
below
01
f
cc
(
51
fr
22711
.
in
the
preamble
to
its
proposed
amendments
the
agency
noted
that
available
data
indicated
that
glove
bags
in
use
may
not
always
provide
adequate
protection
.
in
large
part
,
the
agency
based
this
preliminary
evaluation
on
the
results
of
an
evaluation
performed
by
niosh
in
which
improperly
used
glove
bags
resulted
in
excessive
fiber
counts
.
as
noted
above
,
this
final
construction
standard
expands
the
conditions
in
which
glove
bag
use
is
allowed
.
now
,
glove
bag
use
for
removal
of
tsi
and
surfacing
acm
is
allowed
without
quantity
limitation
for
intact
tsi
for
straight
runs
of
piping
.
