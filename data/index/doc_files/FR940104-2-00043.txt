medicare
covers
diagnostic
npt
testing
.
although
impotence
is
not
a
sleep
disorder
,
the
nature
of
the
testing
requires
that
it
be
performed
while
a
patient
sleeps
.
as
discussed
in
detail
in
section
ic
.
of
this
notice
,
the
ohta
technology
assessment
has
concluded
that
npt
testing
in
the
sleep
disorder
clinic
is
not
a
reliable
index
for
evaluating
impotence
.
falsepositive
false
positive
and
falsenegative
false
negative
results
occur
frequently
indicating
that
npt
testing
is
not
a
reliable
indicator
for
choosing
the
appropriate
treatment
.
based
on
scientific
evidence
that
indicates
that
npt
testing
is
not
a
reliable
index
for
evaluating
impotence
,
we
have
concluded
that
npt
testing
does
not
meet
our
criteria
for
effectiveness
,
a
primary
requirement
for
medicare
program
coverage
.
we
believe
the
test
has
not
been
performed
often
by
medical
practitioners
because
of
the
tests
limited
value
.
therefore
,
we
propose
to
withdraw
medicare
coverage
of
npt
testing
in
the
sleep
disorder
clinic
and
exclude
coverage
of
npt
testing
by
plethysmography
and
other
monitoring
devices
in
all
other
settings
.
our
decision
to
withdraw
coverage
should
have
only
a
minimal
effect
on
small
entities
.
therefore
,
we
are
not
preparing
analyses
for
either
the
rfa
or
section
1102b
)
of
the
act
since
we
have
determined
,
and
the
secretary
certifies
,
that
this
notice
would
not
result
in
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
and
would
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
operations
of
a
substantial
number
of
small
rural
hospitals
.
