because
of
the
imprecise
nature
of
the
impacts
of
the
blocks
of
time
,
and
upon
receipt
of
the
nmfs
northeast
fisheries
science
centers
(
nefsc
)
comprehensive
spatial
and
temporal
analysis
of
the
bycatch
in
the
fall
of
1993
,
the
council
voted
to
support
the
development
of
a
time
and
area
closure
management
system
.
the
intent
was
to
replace
the
existing
gillnet
alternative
(
nets
removed
from
the
water
for
specified
blocks
of
time
)
as
the
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
mitigation
measure
.
the
council
decided
,
and
nmfs
agreed
,
that
the
gillnet
fleet
would
not
be
subject
to
groundfish
effort
reductions
until
the
effect
of
the
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
reduction
measures
could
be
evaluated
for
their
impacts
on
groundfish
fishing
effort
(
approximately
1
year
after
implementation
of
amendment
5
.
nmfs
is
amending
the
regulations
under
the
framework
abbreviated
rulemaking
procedure
established
by
amendment
5
and
codified
at
50
cfr
part
651
,
subpart
c
.
this
procedure
requires
the
council
,
when
making
specifically
allowed
adjustments
to
the
fmp
,
to
develop
and
analyze
the
actions
over
the
span
of
at
least
two
council
meetings
.
the
council
must
provide
the
public
with
advance
notice
of
both
the
proposals
and
the
analysis
,
and
opportunity
to
comment
on
them
prior
to
and
at
the
second
council
meeting
.
upon
review
of
the
analysis
and
public
comment
,
the
council
may
recommend
to
the
regional
director
of
nmfs
that
the
measures
be
published
as
a
final
rule
if
certain
conditions
are
met
.
the
director
,
northeast
region
,
nmfs
,
(
regional
director
)
may
publish
the
measures
as
a
final
rule
or
as
a
proposed
rule
if
additional
public
comment
is
needed
.
the
council
complied
with
the
procedural
requirements
and
submitted
the
rule
to
nmfs
,
and
nmfs
concurs
with
the
provisions
of
the
councils
submission
.
this
final
rule
implements
time
and
area
closures
based
on
an
analysis
by
the
nefsc
of
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
using
nmfs
weighout
and
observer
program
data
on
the
distribution
of
sink
gillnet
activity
and
the
seasonal
and
spatial
distribution
of
harbor
porpoise
in
the
gulf
of
maine
.
extensive
discussions
among
the
council
,
the
fishing
industry
and
scientists
led
to
the
measures
outlined
below
.
for
purposes
of
the
management
measures
contained
in
this
final
rule
for
framework
adjustment
4
,
the
gulf
of
maine
is
divided
into
three
areas
:
the
northeast
(
from
penobscot
bay
to
eastport
,
me
;
midcoast
mid
coast
(
from
cape
ann
to
penobscot
bay
;
and
massachusetts
bay
(
from
cape
cod
to
cape
ann
.
the
council
recommended
30day
day
closures
for
each
of
these
areas
.
the
timing
of
the
closures
corresponds
to
periods
when
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
is
most
likely
to
occur
.
the
duration
accounts
for
the
variability
of
harbor
porpoise
movements
.
the
council
recognizes
that
the
midcoast
mid
coast
and
northeast
areas
account
for
more
of
the
bycatch
than
massachusetts
bay
.
at
this
time
,
however
,
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
mitigation
measures
are
being
applied
uniformly
across
all
regions
in
the
gulf
of
maine
.
the
nefsc
estimated
that
reductions
of
20
to
40
percent
might
be
realized
in
the
first
year
of
implementation
of
framework
adjustment
4
if
boundaries
discussed
in
its
initial
analysis
of
a
time
and
area
management
system
for
the
gulf
of
maine
were
used
in
conjunction
with
the
proposed
30day
day
closures
.
the
councils
boundary
modifications
could
alter
that
estimate
to
some
unknown
degree
because
of
the
potential
displacement
of
gillnet
fishing
effort
to
areas
where
harbor
porpoise
are
still
subject
to
some
level
of
bycatch
.
it
is
reasonable
,
however
,
to
anticipate
the
minimum
estimate
of
approximately
20
percent
,
given
that
the
timing
of
the
closures
occurs
in
seasons
of
highest
bycatch
of
harbor
porpoise
in
their
respective
areas
.
it
is
also
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
continued
annual
target
reductions
may
be
accomplished
by
modifications
to
the
same
measures
.
the
council
adopted
the
approach
of
integrating
effort
reductions
for
key
species
of
groundfish
stocks
with
harbor
porpoise
bycatch
mitigation
measures
after
the
first
year
of
program
implementation
.
if
the
measures
,
or
any
future
approach
that
is
adopted
,
accomplish
the
harbor
porpoise
objective
without
reducing
gillnet
fishing
effort
sufficiently
to
reach
the
50
percent
effort
reduction
target
,
the
council
will
impose
additional
fishing
restrictions
.
a
.
northeast
closure
area
this
area
will
be
closed
to
fishing
with
sink
gillnets
from
august
15
through
september
13
of
each
fishing
year
.
