and

,
are
not

in

the

accounting
for

and
recycling
of

,
shall
be
calculated
monthly
.
actual
copies
of
the
logs
should
be
made
available
to
the
administrator
or
permitting
authority
upon
request
.
the
committee
agreed
with
the
work
practice
work
groups
recommendation
that
an
accounting
system
be
implemented
by
affected
sources
.
the
committee
believed
that
once
the
accounting
system
was
in
place
,
the
burden
of
maintaining
it
would
not
be
too
great
.
the
committee
also
believed
that
the
accounting
system
would
be
an
important
first
step
for
facilities
to
develop
a
broadbased
broad
based
,
multimedia
pollution
prevention
plan
.
some
agency
officials
have
expressed
concern
that
the
proposed
rule
only
restricts
the
use
of
epa
type
a
and
type
b
/
b
carcinogens
in
cleaning
and
washoff
solvents
.
they
are
concerned
that
restricting
the
use
of
only
these
chemicals
implies
that
they
are
worse
than
other
hap
.
they
are
also
concerned
that
the
rule
draws
a
clear
line
between
type
b
and
c
carcinogens
,
although
the
scientific
evidence
does
not
suggest
such
a
clear
distinction
.
for
example
,
some
pollutants
on
the
hap
list
are
designated
type
b
c
because
the
data
cannot
clearly
support
a
designation
of
type
b
or
c
.
the
proposed
rule
does
not
address
these
pollutants
.
finally
,
the
agency
is
planning
to
update
their
risk
assessment
guidelines
.
under
these
revised
guidelines
,
the
terms
type
a
and
type
b
carcinogens
are
likely
to
be
meaningless
.
the
committee
agreed
to
restrict
the
use
of
type
a
and
type
b
/
b
carcinogens
only
,
so
the
epa
is
proposing
the
rule
using
this
approach
.
however
,
to
address
the
concerns
of
some
agency
officials
,
the
epa
is
specifically
requesting
comment
on
this
issue
including
:
1
.
should
additional
hap
,
for
example
,
all
vhap
of
potential
concern
,
be
restricted
from
use
in
cleaning
and
washoff
solvents
;
2
.
if
the
approach
proposed
in
the
rule
is
used
,
how
should
chemicals
designated
as
type
b
c
carcinogens
be
addressed
;
and
3
.
if
the
approach
proposed
in
the
rule
is
used
and
the
risk
assessment
guidelines
are
revised
so
that
the
terms
type
a
and
type
b
become
obsolete
,
how
could
the
rule
be
revised
to
maintain
the
intent
of
the
proposed
rule
?
c
.
general
work
practice
requirements
.
after
reviewing
the
work
practices
to
be
included
,
the
committee
concluded
that
in
order
for
the
proposed
work
practices
to
be
successfully
implemented
,
employees
that
would
actually
have
to
carry
them
out
should
be
involved
in
their
implementation
.
therefore
,
an
operator
training
program
is
included
as
a
proposed
work
practice
.
the
committee
believed
that
operator
training
was
especially
important
for
new
employees
and
therefore
proposed
that
new
employees
be
trained
upon
hiring
.
the
committee
agreed
that
the
proposed
rule
should
be
flexible
and
allow
sources
to
develop
programs
that
work
best
for
their
facility
or
that
could
be
coordinated
with
existing
training
programs
.
the
proposed
rule
does
require
that
,
at
a
minimum
,
the
employee
training
program
address
coating
application
,
cleaning
,
and
washoff
techniques
that
minimize
emissions
;
appropriate
equipment
operation
;
methods
to
reduce
solvent
usage
;
and
proper
management
of
cleanup
wastes
.
the
committee
also
proposed
that
the
rule
require
retraining
of
all
employees
on
an
annual
basis
.
members
of
the
work
practice
work
group
proposed
to
the
committee
that
the
standards
should
require
affected
sources
to
develop
an
implementation
plan
that
describes
how
sources
plan
to
comply
with
the
work
practice
requirements
on
an
ongoing
on
going
basis
.
based
on
the
proposed
work
practices
,
the
committee
believed
that
any
implementation
plan
should
include
,
at
a
minimum
,
the
following
:
1
.
checklists
to
document
that
:
_
all
storage
containers
are
covered
when
not
in
use
;
_
solvents
are
not
being
used
for
spray
booth
cleaning
except
as
allowed
by
the
proposed
rule
;
_
conventional
air
spray
guns
are
not
in
use
except
as
allowed
by
the
proposed
rule
;
