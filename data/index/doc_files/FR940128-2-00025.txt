this

gosip
security
labels
carry
information
used
by
protocol
entities
to
determine
how
to
handle
data
communicated
between
open
systems
.
information
on
a
security
label
can
be
used
to
control
access
,
specify
protective
measures
,
and
determine
additional
handling
restrictions
required
by
a
communications
security
policy
.
this
standard
specifies
the
syntax
for
the
labels
and
relies
on
a
computer
security
objects
register
(
csor
)
to
provide
the
semantics
.
the
separation
of
the
label
syntax
from
its
semantics
enables
a
common
label
format
to
support
multiple
security
policies
and
facilitate
crossdomain
cross
domain
communications
.
given
the
inherent
differences
in
layer
functionality
the
security
label
defined
in
this
document
is
expressed
both
as
an
abstract
label
syntax
specification
for
the
osi
application
layer
and
an
encoding
optimized
for
use
at
the
network
layer
.
the
application
and
network
layers
are
the
initial
targets
of
gosip
security
.
the
label
presented
here
defines
security
tags
that
may
be
combined
into
tag
sets
to
carry
securityrelated
security
related
information
.
five
basic
security
tag
types
allow
security
information
to
be
represented
as
bit
maps
,
