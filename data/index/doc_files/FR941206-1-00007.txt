)
and
the
absence
of
regulation
on
the
use
of
mdp
have
raised
two
major
policy
issues
.
the
first
is
whether
current
regulations
are
adequately
protecting
consumers
.
the
second
is
whether
different
regulatory
treatment
for
these
similar
products
is
justified
.
fsis
is
not
proposing
this
regulation
because
of
the
current
differences
in
the
regulatory
treatment
of
mdp
and
mss
,
but
rather
because
its
basic
statutory
mission
is
to
assure
that
products
bear
labeling
that
is
truthful
and
not
misleading
.
accordingly
,
fsis
has
determined
that
providing
this
assurance
requires
the
regulation
of
mdp

soliciting

,
and

regarding
the
consideration
of
the
need
for

of

product
produced
by

products
in

fsis
received
2744
comments
in
response
to
the
anpr
,
most
of
which
were
general
reactions
to
labeling
issues
.
the
majority
of
commenters
responded
to
whether
there
was
a
need
to
identify
mechanically
separated
poultry
in
the
ingredients
statement
on
the
labels
of
meat
and
poultry
products
in
which
it
is
used
as
an
ingredient
.
one

eighty
seven
commenters
supported
identifying
mechanically
separated
poultry
in
the
ingredients
statement
because
,
the
commenters
stated
that
,
among
other
things
,
consumers
have
`
a
right
to
know
'
it
is
an

.
one

fifty
seven
commenters
did
not
support
identifying
mechanically
separated
poultry
in
the
ingredients
statement
,
citing
,
in
part
,
that
current
policies
are
satisfactory
and
that
labeling
it
would
mislead
consumers
into
thinking
that
they
are
purchasing
products
that
are
inferior
or
different
than
the
product
they
have
historically
purchased
.
fsis
concluded
that
there
is
a
`

truth
in

issue
that
is
founded
in
the
mandate
under
which
the
agency
operates
,
viz
,
protecting
consumers
from
misbranded
poultry
and
meat
products
.
subsequently
,
fsis
decided
to
obtain
the
information
and
data
necessary
to
pursue
the
development
of
amendments
to
the
federal
poultry
products
inspection
regulations
to
define
and
standardize

or
establish
other
requirements
for
poultry

including
possible
provisions
for
the
composition

and
use
of
such

and
requirements
for
manufacturing
and
labeling
such

in
the
03/19/1994
anpr
,
fsis
considered
,
among
other
things
,
that
certain
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical

,
ie
,
those
with
greater
than
06
percent
bone

content
,
but
no
more

1

be
separately
identified
on
the

in
which
they
are
used
as

by
a

however
,
because
of
the
improvements
in
separating
the
bone
from
muscle
and
other
tissues
of
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of

,
fsis
considered
that
some
poultry
products
derived
from
mechanical
separation
machinery
,
ie
,
those
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
,
be
