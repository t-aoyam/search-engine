discussion
:
the
secretary
has
articulated
quite
clearly
in
the
preamble
to
both
the
proposed
and
final
regulations
why
he
is
taking
this
action
.
the
national
evaluation
standards
were
adopted
in
1989
and
represented
the
best
thinking
at
that
time
about
how
to
implement
the
statutory
evaluation
requirements
.
they
were
predicated
largely
on
the
perceived
need
to
use
a
measure
that
would
provide
data
that
could
be
aggregated
for
the
nationie
,
nationally
normed
tests
or
tests
equated
with
national
normseven
though
the
statute
itself
does
not
require
aggregation
to
either
the
state
or
national
level
.
since
then
,
two
developments
of
national
significance
have
required
a
change
in
those
national
standards
.
first
,
a
number
of
states
have
developed
new
assessment
systems
,
linked
to
their
statewide
education
reform
efforts
,
to
improve
the
quality
of
education
in
their
states
.
these
assessment
systems
are
tied
to
high
state
standards
for
what
children
should
know
and
be
able
to
do
,
but
in
some
instances
are
inconsistent
with
the
national
evaluation
standards
because
they
do
not
routinely
rely
on
nationally
normed
tests
and
typically
only
assess
children
in
certain
grades
.
as
a
result
,
these
states
must
operate
separate
assessment
systems
:
ones
that
they
use
to
make
informed
decisions
about
the
effectiveness
of
education
programs
in
their
state
;
and
ones
that
they
use
only
for
chapter
1
or
mep
purposes
.
as
a
related
matter
,
major
educational
reform
legislation
,

section
306c
)
of
goals
2000
requires
reform
plans
developed
under
the
statute
to
include
a
description
of
the
process
a
state
will
use
to
develop
state
assessments
aligned
with
the
states
content
standards
and
that
the
assessments
be
for
all
students
,
including
students
with
diverse
learning
needs
.
these
regulations
will
allow
states
that
have
assessment
systems
tied
to
statewide
education
reform
,
developed
under
goals
2000
or
another
effort
,
to
obtain
exceptions
from
existing
chapter
1
and
mep
evaluation
requirements
and
,
subject
to
less
prescriptive
standards
in
these
regulations
,
use
their
statewide
assessments
for
chapter
1
and
mep
purposes
.
by
allowing
those
states
that
already
have
developed
assessment
systems
tied
to
statewide
education
reform
efforts
to
obtain
exceptions
from
existing
chapter
1
and
mep
evaluation
requirements
,
these
regulations
permit
those
states
to
focus
their
energies
on
the
new
assessments
without
having
to
implement
a
separate
assessment
system
for
chapter
1
and
mep
that
may
not
support
reform
efforts
.
the
secretary
believes
that
requiring
these
states
to
operate
separate
assessment
systems
for
chapter
1
and
mep
purposes
serves
neither
the
interests
of
participating
children
nor
the
federal
programs
involved
.
