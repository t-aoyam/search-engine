the
commission
is
also
concerned
about
potential
practical
problems
with
this
approach
.
for
example
,
if
a
candidates
doi
occurs
early
in
the
election
cycle
,
there
will
be
a
substantial
gap
between
the

a
related
concern
is
that
,
under
these
circumstances
,
the
commission
may
be
well
along
in
the
audit
of
a
candidates
campaign
by
the
time
the
convention
opens
.
providing
an
additional
matching
fund
period
to
such
candidates
could
substantially
complicate
the
audit
process
.
if
this
approach
were
to
be
adopted
,
the
commission
welcomes
comments
on
who
should
be
covered
by
the
new
provision
,
and
during
what
timeframe
it
should
apply
.
should
this
be
limited
to
expenses
incurred
by
the
candidate
,
or
the
candidate
and
his
or
her
immediate
family
,
or
should
it
also
include
campaign
staff
?
if
the
latter
,
should
such
staff
be
limited
,
either
by
number
or
position
held
in
the
campaign
?
the
commission
notes
that
,
where
a
number
of
candidates
sought
the
nomination
,
the
expenses
of
these
candidates
,
their
families
,
and
accompanying
campaign
staff
could
be
substantial
.
please
note
that
the
draft
rules
that
follow
do
not
include
any
specific
regulatory
language
on
this
point

calculation
of

under
section
90382b2
,

are

are

.
the
amount
of
any
repayment
sought
under
section
90382b2
)
bears
the
same
ratio
to
the
total
amount
of
nonqualified
qualified
campaign
expenses
as
the
amount
of
matching
funds
certified
to
the
candidate
bears
to
the
candidates
total
deposits
,
as
of
the
candidates
date
of
ineligibility
.
repayment
determinations
under
this
section
include
all
nonqualified
qualified
campaign
expenses
paid
between
the
committees
date
of
inception
and
the
point
when
committee
accounts
no
longer
contain
matching
funds
.
thus
,
the
repayment
amount
is
calculated
by
multiplying
the
total
nonqualified
qualified
campaign
expenses
by
the
repayment
ratio
,
as
determined
on
the
candidates
date
of
ineligibility
.
however
,
this
section
does
not
serve
its
intended
purpose
when
applied
to
a
candidate
that
receives
a
significant
amount
of
matching
payments
after
his
or
her
date
of
ineligibility
.
section
90382b2
)
does
not
take
into
account
private
contributions
received
by
the
candidate
after
his
or
her
date
of
ineligibility
.
consequently
,
when
this
section
is
applied
to
a
candidate
that
receives
a
significant
amount
of
private
contributions
after
that
date
,
it
generates
a
repayment
amount
that
does
not
accurately
reflect
the
ratio
of
matching
payments
to
private
contributions
actually
received
by
that
candidate
during
the
courts
of
the
campaign
.
similarly
,
section
90382b2
)
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute
when
applied
to
a
candidate
who
does
not
receive
matching
payments
until
after
his
or
her
date
of
ineligibility
.
section
9038b2
)
of
the
matching
payment
account
act
requires
a
candidate
who
uses
public
funds
for
nonqualified
qualified
campaign
expenses
to
repay
a
portion
of
the
public
funds
he
or
she
received
to
the
treasury
.
however
,
when
section
90382b2
)
of
the
regulations
is
applied
to
a
candidate
who
does
not
receive
matching
payments
until
after
his
or
her
date
of
ineligibility
,
the
rule
arguably
generates
a
repayment
ratio
of
zero
even
if
the
candidate
incurred
numerous
nonqualified
qualified
campaign
expenses
.
thus
,
under
the
regulations
,
the
candidate
would
not
be
required
to
repay
any
of
those
funds
,
even
though
the
statute
specifically
requires
repayment
in
this
situation
.
section
90382b2iii
)
of
the
proposed
rules
contains
two
proposed
revisions
that
would
address
these
situations
.
the
first
proposal
would
change
the
date
for
determining
the
candidates
repayment
ratio
from
the
date
of
ineligibility
to
90
days
after
the
date
of
ineligibility
.
a
ratio
determined
on
the
later
date
would
take
into
account
most
of
the
postdoi
doi
private
contributions
received
by
the
candidate
.
as
a
result
,
the
ratio
will
more
accurately
reflect
the
amount
of
matching
payments
and
private
contributions
actually
received
.
this
approach
would
also
produce
an
accurate
repayment
ratio
and
repayment
amount
for
those
candidates
that
do
not
receive
any
matching
payments
until
after
their
date
of
ineligibility
.
as
a
result
,
this
proposed
revision
would
address
both
of
the
situations
described
above
.
the
second
proposal
,
which
is
set
out
in
paragraph
(
a
)
of
this
section
,
would
take
a
narrower
approach
.
under
this
proposal
,
the
commission
would
treat
all
matching
funds
certified
in
response
to
matching
payment
submissions
received
as
of
the
candidates
date
of
ineligibility
as
though
they
were
certified
as
of
the
candidates
date
of
ineligibility
.
treating
these
funds
as
though
they
were
certified
predoi
doi
would
allow
the
commission
to
use
these
funds
to
calculate
the
repayment
ratio
,
resulting
in
a
ratio
of
an
amount
greater
than
zero
that
reflects
the
mix
of
public
funds
and
private
contributions
actually
received
.
the
commission
could
then
use
this
ratio
to
determine
the
amount
that
the
candidate
is
required
to
repay
under
section
9038b2
)
of
the
statute
.
