the
epa
proposes
,
in
§
63
800
)
of
the
proposed
rule
,
that
if
owners
or
operators
commit
to
using
no
more
than
250
gallons
per
month
,
or
3000
gallons
per
rolling
12month
month
period
,
of
coating
,
gluing
,
cleaning
,
and
washoff
materials
at
the
plant
site
,
and
if
the
plant
site
does
not
contain
other
sources
of
hap
emissions
,
then
the
plant
site
can
be
considered
an
area
source
to
which
the
rule
does
not
apply
.
the
250
gallon
level
was
selected
based
upon
worstcase
worst
case
assumptions
regarding
the
levels
of
hap
in
the
various
materials
.
the
proposed
rule
would
require
a
commitment
to
this
level
,
accompanied
by
monthly
records
of
materials
.
the
epa
requests
comment
on
:
(
1
)
whether
an
alternative
to
the
250/3000
gallon
level
would
be
appropriate
,
(
2
)
the
level
and
type
of
reporting
needed
to
document
the
owners
commitment
,
and
(
3
)
the
frequency
and
nature
of
the
recordkeeping
requirement
.
the
epa
believes
that
there
are
sources
using
more
than
250
gallons
per
month
that
may
emit
less
than
`
major
'
amounts
,
and
for
which
the
owner
or
operator
may
be
willing
to
accept
casebycase
case
by
case
operating
restrictions
that
would
ensure
that
the
potential
to
emit
does
not
exceed
the
major
source
threshold
.
the
epa
is
considering
adding
language
to
the
final
rule
that
would
provide
a
mechanism
for
such
sources
.
the
epa
requests
comment
on
(
1
)
whether
such
language
should
be
added
,
(
2
)
the
type
of
reporting
and
process
required
to
establish
the
casebycase
case
by
case
commitment
,
(
in
particular
,
how
to
establish
throughput
and
content
limitations
that
could
ensure
area
source
status
,
and
(
3
)
the
types
of
records
that
should
be
maintained
to
document
compliance
with
the
restrictions
.
in
addition
,
the
epa
requests
comment
on
whether
the
level
of
recordkeeping
and
reporting
should
vary
,
depending
on
the
level
of
emissions
(
as
reflected
by
the
throughput
and
content
of
the
materials
used
.
the
epa
requests
comment
on
the
appropriate
timing
of
a
wood
furniture
facilitys
applicability
determination
,
and
on
whether
all
facilities
,
regardless
of
their
past
emissions
or
hap
usage
,
should
be
eligible
to
qualify
as
area
sources
under
the
hap
usage
limits
.
the
agency
also
seeks
comment
on
whether
a
facility
that
is
initially
determined
to
be
subject
to
the
rule
should
be
able
subsequently
to
escape
applicability
,
and
if
so
,
under
what
circumstances
.
as
stated
in
section
ii
,
the
wood
furniture
manufacturing
industry
encompasses
the
manufacture
of
many
different
products
including
cabinets
,
office
furniture
,
store
fixtures
,
and
residential
furniture
.
the
specific
operations
to
which
the
proposed
rule
would
apply
include
those
that
fall
under
the
standard
industrial
classification
(
sic
)
codes
listed
in
table
2
.
for
the
purposes
of
the
proposed
rule
,
the
affected
emission
source
includes
the
finishing
,
gluing
,
cleaning
,
and
washoff
operations
at
each
wood
furniture
plant
.
