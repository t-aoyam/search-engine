the
decision
to

will
be
greatly
influenced
by
the
relationship
between
employers
and
landlords
.
since
changes
in
building
ventilation
systems
will
be
made
by
landlords
,
employers
may

to
negotiate
agreements
to
ensure
that
they

landlords
in

are

to
pressure
employers
to

;
thereby
,
forestalling
any
need
for

of

rooms
.
this

also
examines
the
technological
feasibility
of
complying
with

technological
feasibility
as
interpreted
in
the
benzene
and
cotton
dust
cases
,
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
of
1970
requires
that
the
agency
,
with
regard
to
exposure
to
toxic
substances
,
is
to
reduce
significant
risk
of
material
health
impairment
to
the
extent
feasible
.
accordingly
,
as
part
of
the
investigation
of
the
potential
effects
of
the
osha
proposal
,
osha
has
examined
both
the
technological
and
economic
feasibility
of
the
proposal
.
the
economic
feasibility
assessment
appears
later
.
oshas
assessment
of
the
technological
feasibility
is
based
on
an
examination
of
what
would
be
required
to
comply
with
the
proposal
,
along
with
a
review
of
existing
practices
among
affected
establishments
.
with
regard
to
this
proposal
,
problems
with
technological
feasibility
,
by
and
large
,
are
not
evident
.
employers
are
required
to
operate
their
hvac
systems
within
those
parameters
originally
designated
for
the
equipment
.
while
many
employers
may
choose
to
provide
separately
ventilated
smoking
areas
,
this
is
an
option
,
not
a
requirement
,
under
the
proposed
regulation
.
this
technology
is
widespread
currently
and
can
be
used
to
achieve
compliance
with
the
proposed
standard
.
for
example
,
in
some
situations
,
such
as
hotels
and
prisons
,
employees
have
as
their
workplace
the
residence
of
others
who
live
in
that
building
.
restaurants
,
bars
and
other
`
public
'
places
expose
employees
to
customers
tobacco
smoke
.
while
it
is
technologically
feasible
to
ban
smoking
in
those
establishments
,
there
may
be
other
problems
,
legal
and
economic
.
while
it
is
theoretically
possible
to
minimize
employee
exposure
to
ets
in
such
a
work
environment
through
special
ventilation
,
in
the
absence
of
modified
customer
service
arrangements
,
actually
eliminating
worker
exposure
to
ets
would
likely
prove
difficult
.
consequently
,
the
selection
process
for
one
of
the
smoking
policy
alternatives
for
a
particular
workplace
must
consider
both
the
physical
limitations
of
the
building
or
firm
and
the
buildings
use
.
in
addition
,
some
employers
may
be
using
their
building
facilities
for
purposes
for
which
the
original
design
did
not
intend
,
and
for
which
retrofitting
might
prove
difficult
.
osha
requests
comment
on
those
workplaces
for
which
compliance
with
the
proposed
standard
would
prove
technologically
challenging
.

on
the
ability
of

on
whether
