clearly
the
upper
respiratory
effects
and
severe
headaches
associated
with
poor
indoor
air
quality
are
of
the
type
that
interfere
with
the
performance
of
work
.
the
severe
headaches
were
such
that
medical
treatment
had
to
be
sought
;
certainly
such
headaches
were
impairing
at
the
time
they
occurred
,
even
though
they
were
not
permanent
.
the
upper
respiratory
symptoms
were
also
severe
enough
to
either
require
medical
attention
or
restrict
activity
.
there
is
ample
precedent
in
osha
rulemaking
proceedings
for
the
regulation
of
working
conditions
to
avoid
health
impairments
that
are
material
but
not
life
threatening
.
the
supreme
court
in
the
cotton
dust
case
,
concluded
that
osha
had
the
authority
to
promulgate
regulations
that
would
avoid
byssinosis
,
a
respiratory
disease
which
in
the
large
majority
of
cases
is
not
deadly
or
disabling
,
and
is
reversible
if
the
employee
left
the
cotton
mills
.
stage
1/2
byssinosis
,
the
most
frequent
type
,
has
relatively
mild
symptoms
.
in
the
case
of
occupational
exposure
to
formaldehyde
,
the
regulation
was
designed
to
avoid
,
among
other
things
,
sensory
irritation
.

osha
regulated
many
chemicals

in

osha
analyzed
which

concluding
that
`

the
osh
act
is
designed
to
be
protective
of
workers
and
is
to
protect
against
impairment
with
less
impact
than
severe
impairment
'
the
less
severe
conditions
,
such
as
upper
respiratory
symptoms
and
severe
headaches
,
caused
by
poor
indoor
air
quality
are
the
same
type
as
the
pels

concluded
were
material
impairments
.
these
specific
conclusions
of
the
agency
with

what
constitutes

were
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
review

(

.
the
court
noted
that
`
section
6b5
)
of
the
act
charges
osha
with
addressing
all
forms
of
`
material
impairment
of
health
or

capacity
'
and
not

`
death
or

from

'
<

therefore
osha
concludes
that
the
adverse
health
effects
caused
by
poor
indoor
air
quality
,
which
range
from
legionellosis
to
severe
headaches
to
upper
respiratory
symptoms
are
material
impairments
of
health
which
the
act
allows
the
agency
to
regulate
.
the
effects
of
the
pneumonia
caused
by
legionella
are
deadly
or
severe
.
although
the
rate
of
risk
may
not
be
as
large
as
1/1000
because
the
number
of
employees
at
risk
is
large
.
this
effect
alone
makes
a
substantial
contribution
to
a
finding
of
significant
risk
,
especially
when
taking
into
account
the
large
number
of
cases
.
as
to
the
severe
headaches
,
the
agency
estimates
that
the
excess
risk
of
developing
the
type
of
nonmigraine
migraine
headache
which
may
need
medical
attention
or
restrict
activity
which
has
been
associated
with
poor
indoor
air
quality
is
57
per
1000
exposed
employees
.
in
addition
the
excess
risk
of
developing
upper
respiratory
symptoms
which
are
severe
enough
to
require
medical
attention
or
restrict
activity
is
estimated
to
be
85
per
1000
exposed
employees
.
these
numbers
are
extrapolated
from
actual
field
studies
and
therefore
show
the
magnitude
of
the
problem
at
present
.
there
is
no
doubt
that
better
maintenance
of
ventilation
systems
such
as
required
in
the
proposal
will
improve
the
quality
of
air
in
covered
workplaces
and
reduce
the
number
of
cases
.
in
addition
the
types
of
good
practices
prescribed
in
the
proposal
will
substantially
reduce
the
type
of
microbial
contamination
associated
with
legionnaires
disease
.
therefore
,
osha
concludes
that
this
number
of
less
severe
effects
along
with
the
severe
effects
from
legionnaires
disease
,
together
,
constitute
a
significant
risk
.
accordingly
,
osha
preliminarily
concludes
that
,
the
proposal
will
substantially
reduce
a
significant
risk
of
material
impairment
of
health
from
poor
indoor
air
quality
.
