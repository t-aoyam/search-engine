many
published
reports
on
building
wellness
describe
buildings
in
terms
of
two
general
categories
,
sick
or
well
buildings
.
some
of
the
published
categories
,
in
addition
to
the
terms
sick
or
well
are
:
problem
buildings
and
nonproblem
problem
buildings
,
healthy
buildings
;
buildings
with
high
and
low
rates
of
iaq
related
complaints
;
sick
building
syndrome
(
sbs
.
the
sbs
symptom
complex
is
characterized
by
a
range
of
symptoms
including
but
not
limited
to
,
eye
,
nose
and
throat
irritation
,
dryness
of
mucous

and

within
a
given
building
there
will
usually
be
some
commonality
among
the
symptoms
manifested
as
well
as
temporal
association
between
occupancy
in
the
building
and
appearance
of
symptoms
.
many
people
who
work
in
buildings
characterized
as
having
sbs
typically
exhibit
health
symptoms
that
disappear
when
the
person
is
no
longer
in
the
building
.
in
most
cases
,
a
physical
basis
for
the
occurrence
of
the
sbs
can
be
found
:
lack
of
proper
maintenance
,
changes
in
thermal
or
contaminant
loads
imposed
during
the
buildings
life
,
changes
in
control
strategies
to
meet
new
objectives
(
eg
,
energy
conservation
)
or
inadequate
design
.

building
related
illnesses
(
bri
,
on
the
other
hand
,
are
medically
diagnosed
diseases
that
present
symptoms
that
can
last
for
weeks
,
months
,
years
or
even
a
lifetime
.
examples
include
nosocomial
infections
,
humidifier

hypersensitivity
pneumonitis

can
develop
as
a
result
of
poor
building
systems
operation
and
maintenance
and
uncontrolled

no
building
has
a
complete
absence
of
problems

but
those
that
function
with
minimal
occupant
complaints
and
comply
with
acceptable
criteria
for
occupant
exposure
,
system
performance
,
maintenance
procedures
and
economic
objectives
may
be
characterized
as
healthy
