_
water
sprayers
should
be
used
to
keep
the
asbestos
material
as
saturated
as
possible
during
removal
;
the
sprayers
will
provide
a
fine
mist
that
minimizes
the
impact
of

_
water
used
to
saturate
the
asbestos
containing
material
can
be
amended
by
adding
at
least
15
milliliters
(
1/4
ounce
)
of
wetting
agent
in
1
liter
(
1
pint
)
of
water
.
an
example
of
a
wetting
agent
is
a
50/50
mixture
of
polyoxyethylene
ether
and
polyoxyethylene
polyglycol
ester
.
_
backup
power
supplies
are
recommended
,
especially
for

water
should
be
with
mixed
hot
and

water
that
has
been
used
to
clean
personnel
or

should
either
be
filtered

should
be
provided
to

preparing
the
work
area
disabling
hvac
systems
:
the
power
to
the
heating
,
ventilation
,
and
air
conditioning
systems
that
service
the
restricted
area
must
be
deactivated
and
locked
off
.
all
ducts
,
grills
,
access
ports
,
windows
and
vents
must
be
sealed
off
with
two
layers
of
plastic
to
prevent
entrainment
of
contaminated
air
.
operating
hvac
systems
in
the
restricted
area
:
if
components
of
a
hvac
system
located
in
the
restricted
area
are
connected
to
a
system
that
will
service
another
zone
during
the
project
,
the
portion
of
the
duct
in
the
restricted
area
must
be
sealed
and
pressurized
.
necessary
precautions
include
caulking
the
duct
joints
,
covering
all
cracks
and
openings
with
two
layers
of
sheeting
,
and
pressurizing
the
duct
throughout
the
duration
of
the
project
by
restricting
the
return
air
flow
.
the
power
to
the
fan
supplying
the
positive
pressure
should
be
locked
`
on
'
to
prevent
pressure
loss
.
sealing
elevators
:
if
an
elevator
shaft
is
located
in
the
restricted
area
,
it
should
be
either
shut
down
or
isolated
by
sealing
with
two
layers
of
plastic
sheeting
.
the
sheeting
should
provide
enough
slack
to
accommodate
the
pressure
changes
in
the
shaft
without
breaking
the
airtight
air
tight
seal
.
removing
mobile
objects
:
all
movable
objects
should
be
cleaned
and
removed
from
the
work
area
before
an
enclosure
is
constructed
unless
moving
the
objects
creates
a
hazard
.
mobile
objects
will
be
assumed
to
be
contaminated
and
should
be
either
cleaned
with
amended
water
and
a
hepa
vacuum
and
then
removed
from
the
area
or
wrapped
and
then
disposed
of
as
hazardous
waste
.
cleaning
and
sealing
surfaces
:
after
cleaning
with
water
and
a
hepa
vacuum
,
surfaces
of
stationary
objects
should
be
covered
with
two
layers
of
plastic
sheeting
.
the
sheeting
should
be
secured
with
duct
tape
or
an
equivalent
method
to
provide
a
tight
seal
around
the
object
.
bagging
waste
:
in
addition
to
the
requirement
for
immediate
bagging
of
waste
for
disposal
,
it
is
further
recommended
that
the
waste
material
be
doublebagged
double
bagged
and
sealed
in
plastic
bags
designed
for
asbestos
disposal
.
the
bags
should
be
stored
in
a
waste
storage
area
that
can
be
controlled
by
the
workers
conducting
the
removal
.
filters
removed
from
air
handling
units
and
rubbish
removed
from
the
area
are
to
be
bagged
and
handled
as
hazardous
waste
.
constructing
the
enclosure
the
enclosure
should
be
constructed
to
provide
an
airtight
air
tight
seal
around
ducts
and
openings
into
existing
ventilation
systems
and
around
penetrations
for
electrical
conduits
,
telephone
wires
,
water
lines
,
drain
pipes
,
etc
.
enclosures
should
be
both
airtight
and
watertight
except
for
those
openings
designed
to
provide
entry
and
or
air
flow
control
.
size
:
an
enclosure
should
be
the
minimum
volume
to
encompass
all
of
the
working
surfaces
yet
allow
unencumbered
movement
by
the
workers
,
provide
unrestricted
air
flow
past
the
workers
,
and
ensure
walking
surfaces
can
be
kept
free
of
tripping
hazards
.
shape
:
the
enclosure
may
be
any
shape
that
optimizes
the
flow
of
ventilation
air
past
the
workers
.
