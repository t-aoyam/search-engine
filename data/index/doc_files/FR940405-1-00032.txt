the
amount
assessed
under

.
§
5e12i
)
is
a
fine
,
pursuant
to
the
sentencing
reform
act
of
1984
,
and
is
meant
to
be
punitive
in
nature
as
part
of
an
inmates
overall
sentence
.
in
contrast
,
the
cost
assessed
under
the
proposed
rule
is
a
fee
,
pursuant
to
the
plain
language
of
a
federal
statute
,
and
is
meant
to
recoup
the
administrative
costs
of
confinement
and
improve
institutional
programs
.
furthermore
,
inmates
will
be
assessed
only
one
amount
for
their
costs
of
confinement
.
they
will
either
be
assessed
a
fine
under
§
5e12
,
or
a
fee
under
the
proposed
rule
if
the
sentencing
judge
did
not
assess
or
waive
the
fine
under
§
5e12
.
two
commenters
disagreed
with
the
fact
that
under
the
proposed
rule
§
5051
,
revocation
of
parole
or
supervised
release
is
treated
as
a
separate
period
of
incarceration
for
which
a
fee
may
be
imposed
.
however
,
this
interpretation
is
reasonable
because
in
each
instance
,
the
offenders
conduct
results
in
a
distinct
incarceration
period
and
an
additional
expense
to
the
attorney
general
for
the
cost
of
the
confinement

costs
of
incarceration
.
(
a
)
the
attorney
general
is
authorized
to
establish
and
collect
a
fee
to
cover
the
cost
of
one
year
of
incarceration
.
these
provisions
apply
to
any
person
who
is
convicted
in
a
united
states
district
court
and
committed
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
,
and
who
begins
service
of
sentence
on
or
after
05/05/1994
.
for
the
purposes
of
this
subpart
,
revocation
of
parole
or
supervised
release
shall
be
treated
as
a
separate
period
of
incarceration
for
which
a
fee
may
be
imposed
.
(
b
)
the
fee
to
cover
the
costs
of
incarceration
shall
be
calculated
by
dividing
the
number
representing
the
obligation
encountered
in
bureau
of
prisons
facilities
(
excluding
activation
costs
)
by
the
number
of
inmatedays
inmate
days
incurred
for
the
year
,
and
by
then
multiplying
the
quotient
by
365
.
the
resulting
figure
represents
the
average
cost
to
the
bureau
for
confining
an
inmate
for
one
year
.
(
c
)
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
delegated
the
authority
to
collect
the
fee
to
cover
the
cost
of
incarceration
from
inmates
committed
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
and
to
promulgate
all
regulations
concerning
the
collection
of
the
fee
.
(
d
)
the
director
shall
review
and
determine
the
amount
of
the
fee
not
less
than
annually
in
accordance
with
the
formula
set
forth
in
paragraph
(
b
)
of
