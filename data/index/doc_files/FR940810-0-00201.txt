method
performanceprecision
and
accuracy
precision
is
dependent
upon
the
total
number
of
fibers
counted
and
the
uniformity
of
the
fiber
distribution
on
the
filter
.
a
general
rule
is
to
count
at
least
20
and
not
more
than
100
fields
.
the
count
is
discontinued
when
100
fibers
are
counted
,
provided
that
20
fields
have
already
been
counted
.
counting
more
than
100
fibers
results
in
only
a
small
gain
in
precision
.
as
the
total
count
drops
below
10

,
an
accelerated
loss
of
precision
is
noted
