asbestoscement
asbestos
cement
pipe
(
a
c
pipe
)
is
used
chiefly
for
transporting
drinking
water
in
a
pressurized
condition
and
to
provide
drainage
for
storm
water
,
sewage
and
other
liquid
waste

approximately
90
percent
of

a

pipe
is
also
used
in
industrial
applications
,
to
carry
gaseous
products
,
and
as
an
electrical
conduit
for
heating
,
cooling
and
gas
venting
[

use
of
a
c

in

is
concentrated
in
the
mountain

in

,
the

[

that
`
precut
pre
cut
,
pretapped
tapped
pipe
has
received
tremendous
marketplace
acceptance
and
represents
a
large
majority
of
sales
'
this
is
significant
because
the
use
of
precut
cut
,
pretapped
tapped
pipe
may
reduce
or
eliminate
some
types
of
field
fabrication
activities

a

composed
of
1525
percent
asbestos
,

and

ground
silica

the
use
of
raw
asbestos
in
the
production
of
a

fluctuated
somewhat
but
remained
fairly
constant

the
use
of
substitutes
for
asbestos
and
the
overall
slump
in

in
the
early

probably
account
for
much
of
