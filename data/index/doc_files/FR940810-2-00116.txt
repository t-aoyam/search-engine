(

a

selfregulatory
self
regulatory
organizations
statement
of
the
purpose
of
,
and
statutory
basis
for
,
the
proposed
rule
change
the
purpose
of
the
proposed
rule
change
is
to
increase
the
efficiency
and
liquidity
of
order
execution
through
autox
auto
x
by
adopting
a
`
wheel
'
for
the
automated
assignment
of
floor
traders
as
contraparties
contra
parties
to
incoming
autox
auto
x
orders
.
the
phlx
believes
that
the
wheel
will
make
autox
auto
x
more
efficient
,
as
contraside
contra
side
participation
will
be
assigned
automatically
and
no
longer
entered
manually
.
the
autox
auto
x
system
is
the
automatic
execution
feature
of
the
exchanges
automated
options
market
(
autom
)
system
.
autox
auto
x
provides
customers
with
automatic
executions
of
eligible
option
orders
at
displayed
markets
.
autox
auto
x
orders
are
currently
given
executions
automatically
and
immediately
.
rots
are
added
later
as
contraside
contra
side
participants
to
such
orders
with
manual
keypunch
entries
,
which
can
cause
delays
and
errors
in
processing
executions
.
the
proposed
wheel
is
designed
to
eliminate
manual
keypunching
of
contraside
contra
side
participant
information
relating
to
autox
auto
x
executions
and
the
errors
that
sometimes
result
from
such
keypunching
.
it
also
provides
a
rotation
schedule
by
which
floor
traders
will
automatically
be
assigned
as
the
contraparty
contra
party
to
autox
auto
x
orders
and
will
do
so
in
a
manner
that
reduces
the
number
of
contraside
contra
side
participants
,
which
in
most
cases
will
be
reduced
to
one
contraside
contra
side
per
trade
.
