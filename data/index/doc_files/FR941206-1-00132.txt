we

filings

that
,
in

we
will
provide

with

monthly
billing
statement
.
in
connection
with
the
assessment
and
billing
of
fees
for
electronic
filings
,
we
are
considering
the
option
of
allowing
insurers
to
establish
large
prepaid
accounts
from
which
the
filing
fees
would
automatically
be
deducted
.
this
enhancement
would
reduce
costs
to
both
insurers
and
the
commission
.
once
this
system
has
been
in
place
for
a
sufficient
amount
of
time
,
we
will
review
the
fees
charged
and
the
appropriateness
of
changing
them
to
reflect
the
costs
associated
with
the
new
system

regulatory

the
rules
proposed
herein
will
not
impose
additional
burdens
on
insurers
;
rather
,
they
will
offer
insurers
a

option
of

requirements

while
we
expect
the
impact
of
the
proposed
rules
to
be
beneficial
,
we
do
not
anticipate
it
to
be
significant
on

the

action
will
not
significantly
affect
either
the
quality
of
the
human
environment
or
the
conservation
of
