a

at

thereafter

both

offer
must
be
higher
than
his

then
allows
the
member
to
execute
the
cross
transaction
at
his
or
her
bid
or
offer
.
under
this
method
,
however
,
another
member
can
`
break
up
'
the
cross
by
trading
with
either
the
bid

the
offer
side
of
the
transaction
when
it
is
presented
to
the
crowd

the

proposes
to
formalize
several
policies

committee
previously
developed

encourage
the
execution
of

transactions
on

specifically
,
the
proposed
commentary
to
rule

will
codify
the
pses
policy
that
all
efforts
should
be
made
to
facilitate
the
execution
of
crosses
;
and
will
clarify
which
orders
a
member
must
satisfy
before
he
or
she
can
execute
such
a
transaction
.
the
proposed
commentary
also
will
interpret
rule
5
14
,
together
with
the
pses
priority
rule
,
to
prohibit
the
specialist
from
participating
in
a
cross
to
establish
or
increase
his
or
her
position
,

unless
the
member
effecting

transactions
gives
the
specialist
permission
to
do
so
