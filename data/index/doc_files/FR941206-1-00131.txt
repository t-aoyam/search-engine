as
noted
,
we
believe
electronic
filing
will
promote
efficiencies
for
both
the
commission
and
insurers
,
resulting
in
benefits
to
the
public
.
to
help
gauge
the
full
effect
of
our
proposal
,
we
seek
comments
on
the
number
of
insurers
that
envision
filing
electronically
and
the
extent
to
which
they
will
avail
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
file
their
forms
electronically
.
given
the
potential
for
significant
public
benefits
from
electronic
filing
of
insurance
and
substantial
voluntary
use
of
such
a
system
by
insurers
,
we
also
seek
comments
on
the
alternative
of
making
electronic
filing
mandatory
,
either
initially
or
at
some
point
in
the
future
.
such
comments
should
include
a
discussion
of
the
impact
of
such
a
mandatory
system
on
insurers
and
an
assessment
of
the
type
of
system
that
would
be
necessary
to
handle
the
resulting
volume
of
use
.
after
receiving
comments
on
the
proposal
,
our
systems
services
branch
will
build
and
test
the
electronic
filing
system
,
as
well
as
prepare
and
maintain
systems
documentation
and
a
user
manual
.
each
participating
insurer
will
receive
a
unique
account
and
password
for
login
purposes
on
the
timesharing
system
.
we
also
envision
that
the
insurer
could
register
branch
offices
or
other
authorized
filers
under
its
account
and
password
.
we
contemplate
access
being
available
24
hours
a
day
,
7
days
a
week
(
except
scheduled
maintenance
)
by
way
of
dialup
dial
at
either
1200
or
2400
baud
to
a
local
telephone
number
in
the
washington
,
dc
,
metropolitan
area
(
although
we
recognize
that
9600
baud
may
be
more
desirable
.
any
long
distance
telephone
charges
required
to
reach
such
number
will
be
the
responsibility
of
the
filer
,
and
even
at
1200
baud
should
be
minimal
.
once
connected
,
the
insurance
company
will
be
presented
with
a
variety
of
menu
options
.
after
an
authorized
insurer
logs
in
on
the
system
and
selects
the
menu
option
to
upload
insurance
filings
,
the
icc
computer
will
initiate
the
communications
protocol
,
kermit
,
to
receive
filings
.
upon
completion
of
the
transmission
of
the
insurance
filings
,
the
icc
computer
system
will
append
the
filings
to
a
transaction
file
for
subsequent
batch
processing
.
the
insurance
company
will
be
returned
to
the
main
menu
.
one
of
the
menu
options
contemplated
is
the
insurers
ability
to
generate
a
report
showing
the
number
and
type
of
transactions
transmitted
and
received
by
the
icc
.
this
transaction
report
will
not
be
available
to
the
home
office
of
the
insurance
company
at
the
time
the
transactions
are
filed
.
the
home
office
will
receive
a
comprehensive
list
of
filings
accepted
at
the
time
it
receives
its
monthly
billing
statement
.
however
,
mere
transmission
of
the
filings
does
not
guarantee
acceptance
by
the
commission
.
any
record
not
containing
a
valid
field
or
containing
fields
with
incomplete
or
invalid
data
will
be
flagged
with
an
error
code
.
each
of
these
records
will
generate
a
rejection
notice
to
be
sent
back
to
the
insurance
company
.
records
passing
the
initial
validity
checks
will
then
be
edited
field
by
field
against
the
icc
carrier
and
insurance
data
base
.
when
all
transmitted
fields
have
been
edited
and
verified
,
the
filing
will
be
applied
against
the
insurance
master
file
,
either
adding
a
new
filing
or
applying
a
cancellation
against
an
existing
filing
.
all
records
that
do
not
pass
the
automated
edits
will
be
flagged
for
manual
processing
.
after
manual
review
,
those
records
accepted
will
be
applied
against
the
insurance
master
file
,
and
those
rejected
will
generate
a
rejection
letter
.
a
followup
follow
`
hard
copy
'
of
an
accepted
filing
will
not
be
required
.
however
,
we
do
propose
that
insurers
agree
to
furnish
the
commission
a
duplicate
original
of
any
policy
(
or
policies
)
and
all
endorsements
,
surety
bond
,
trust
fund
agreement
,
or
other
filing
.
