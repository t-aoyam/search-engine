comment
:
one
commenter
expressed
concurrence
with
the
need
for
continued
provision
of
services
after
employment
to
help
a
refugee
retain
employment
or
move
to
a
better
job
.
the
commenter
recommended
that
orr
review
the
list
of
services
in
45
cfr
400
153
through
400
156
and
if
additional
services
are
desired
,
specify
them
in

notice
.
response
:
we
are
reviewing
the
list
of
allowable
services
in
45
cfr
subpart
i
to
determine
if
changes
should
be
made
.
such
changes
would
have
to
be
made
through
a
regulatory
change
,
not
through
the
notice
.
comment
:
two
commenters
commended
orr
for
not
restricting
services
to
a
36month

refugee
population
,
while
one
commenter
expressed
disappointment
that
orr
did
not
limit
services
to
a
36month

population
.
response

as
a
point
of
clarification

a
restriction
of

to

time
limited
population
could
only
be
effected
through

comment
:
one
commenter
complained
that
the
requirement
that
states
must
specify
and
justify
the
use
of
funds
for
services
to
refugees
who
have
been
in
the
us
.
more
than
3
years
is
a
reversal
from
previous
years
when
a
justification
was
required
to
use
social
service
funds
for
newlyarrived
newly
arrived
refugees
.
response
:
orr
regulations
under
45
cfr
400
147
require
that
both
the
use
of
funds
for
services
to
newly
arriving
refugees
(
400
147
)
and
the
use
of

services
to
refugees
who
have
been
in
the
us
.
more
than
36
months
(
400
147

must
be
specified
and
justified
as
part
of
a
states
annual
services
plan
.
this
regulation
has
been
in
effect
since
july
1
,
1989
.
the
notice
this

simply
emphasized

instead
of
§
400
147
.
comment

the
requirement
that

should
be

designed
to

a

than

comment
:
one
commenter
recommended
that
the
notice
clarify
that
social
service
funds
may
be
used
to
serve
unemployed
refugees
who
are
not
receiving
cash
assistance
as
long
as
cash
assistance
recipients
make
up
a
percentage
of
the
social
services
caseload
which
is
at
or
above
the
states
welfare
dependency
rate
.
the
commenter
indicated
that
the
state
currently
interprets
the
orr
notice
to
mean
that
only
cash
assistance
clients
may
receive
services
.
response
:
we
believe
the
notice
is
clear
that
social
services
funds
may
be
used
to
serve
noncashassistance
cash
assistance
recipients
.
the
notice
,
under
the
section
`
population
to
be
served
'
states
that
`
social
service
programs
should
not
be
limited
exclusively
to
refugees
who
are
cash
assistance
recipients
'
however
,
as
the
wording
indicates
,
this
is
not
a
mandatory
requirement
.
states
are
not
required
to
ensure
that
cash
assistance
recipients
make
up
a

of
the

caseload
that
is
not
less
than

are

to
give
priority
to
a

comment
:
one
commenter
objected
to
the
use
of
a
floor
amount
for
small
states
.
response
:
we
have
responded
to
this
comment
in
previous
notices
.
since
our
position
has
not
changed
on
this
issue
,
we
refer
the
commenter
to
our
response
in
the
fy
1993
final
social
service
notice
,
published
in
the
federal
register
on
07/28/1993
(

fr
40437
.
comment
:
two
commenters
objected
to
unlimited
state
administrative
costs
for
social
services
.
one
commenter
recommended
capping
administrative
costs
at
5
%
for
any
state
receiving
more
than
$
12
million
in
social
service
funds
and
recommended
that
counties
be
allowed
a
maximum
of
20
%
for
administrative
costs
.
response
:
since
the
statute
does
not
specify
a
limitation
on
the
amount
of
social
service
funds
that
can
be
used
for
administrative
costs
,
we
have
not
imposed
a
limit
on
states
,
choosing
instead
to
allow
states
to
make
that
determination
.
in
regard
to
the
percentage
of
funds
that
counties
may
use
for
administrative
costs
,
this
is
an
issue
that
needs
to
be
resolved
between
county
and
state
,
not
orr
.
as
noted
earlier
,
all
costs
must
meet
federal
grant
requirements
.
comment
:
one
commenter
suggested
that
orr
consider
safeguards
to
ensure
that
primary
emphasis
is
placed
on
serving
new
arrivals
,
with
services
beyond
the
initial
period
being
the
exception
and
only
allowable
if
a
state
has
been
successful
in
meeting
the
needs
of
new
arrivals
.
response
:
such
a
requirement
could
be
put
into
effect
only
through
regulatory
action
.
we
are
giving
this
issue
consideration
.
