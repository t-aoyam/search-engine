this
paragraph
also
provides
that
the
government
will
not
accept
,
for
purposes
of
this
rule
,
blanket
claims
by
counsel
that
he
or
she
represents
all
or
a
large
number
of
employees
of
the
organization
.
it
is
important
to
note
that
this
provision
is
only
relevant
when
the
attorney
for
the
government
would
be
prohibited
by
some
other
provision
of
this
part
from
contacting
an
individual
falling
under
the
broad
claims
of
representation
under
question
.
for
example
,
an
attorney
for
the
government
may
contact
a
lowlevel
low
level
employee
of
a
corporation
,
without
consent
of
that
employees
counsel
or
the
corporations
counsel
,
regarding
a
matter
for
which
the
corporation
has
already
been
indicted
as
part
of
an
undercover
or
overt
factual
investigation
,
if
that
individual
has
not
been
arrested
or
named
as
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
or
civil
law
enforcement
proceeding
.
therefore
,
the
fact
that
an
attorney
has
stated
that
he
or
she
represents
that
individual
will
have
no
bearing
on
whether
the
communication
is
proper
.
however
,
if
a
particular
communication
with
an
individual
employee
included
in
such
a
claim
of
representation
would
be
improper
under
these
regulations
if
he
or
she
were
in
fact
represented
by
counsel
(
for
example
,
communications
to
negotiate
a
plea
agreement
,
then
this
paragraph
provides
that
a
government
attorney
must
first
inquire
whether
the
employee
is
in
fact
represented
before
undertaking
substantive
communications
with
the
employee
.
as
part
of
this
inquiry
,
the
government
attorney
is
not
required
to
disclose
to
the
employee
the
fact
that
counsel
has
asserted
that
he
or
she
represents
the
employee
.
if
the
employee
indicates
that
he
or
she
is
not
represented
by
counsel
,
it
is
proper
for
the
government
attorney
to
treat
the
employee
as
unrepresented
.
if
the
employee
indicates
that
he
or
she
is
represented
by
counsel
with
regard
to
the
relevant
subject
matter
,
the
attorney
for
the
government
shall
treat
that
employee
as
a
represented
person
or
represented
party
,
and
any
further
communications
with
that
individual
shall
be
governed
by
this
part
.
paragraph
(
d
:
communications
with
separately
represented
controlling
individuals
this
paragraph
ensures
that
communications
with
a
controlling
individual
of
an
organization
that
qualifies
as
a
represented
party
are
subject
to
basically
the
same
limitations
,
regardless
of
whether
the
controlling
individual
has
retained
separate
counsel
on
the
same
subject
matter
.
thus
,
this
paragraph
only
applies
in
the
circumstances
in
which
a
controlling
individual
of
a
represented
organizational
party
retains
separate
counsel
.
in
such
circumstances
,
a
government
attorney
may
not
communicate
with
the
controlling
individual
without
the
consent
of
that
individuals
separate
counsel
unless
the
communication
satisfies
one
of
the
exceptions
contained
in
§
776
or
779
of
this
part
.
the
paragraph
also
allows
such
communications
if
the
individual
does
not
qualify
as
a
represented
party
,
initiates
the
communication
,
and
waives
the
presence
of
counsel
.
thus
,
the
same
rules
apply
to
contacts
with
controlling
individuals
of
represented
organizational
parties
who
retain
separate
counsel
as
apply
to
controlling
individuals
of
represented
organizational
parties
who
are
not
separately
represented
.
paragraph
(
e
:
communications
with
unrepresented
controlling
individuals
this
paragraph
addresses
a
relatively
narrow
circumstance
:
when
a
controlling
individual
who
is
not
individually
represented
by
counsel
initiates
a
communication
with
the
government
outside
the
presence
of
counsel
for
the
organization
.
an
attorney
for
the
government
may
participate
in
such
communications
if
:
(
1
)
the
controlling
individual
indicates
that
he
or
she
is
speaking
exclusively
in
his
or
her
personal
capacity
and
not
as
a
representative
of
the
organizational
party
;
and
(

)
he
or
she
indicates
that
the
waiver
of
counsel
is
voluntary
,
knowing
and
informed
and
,
if
willing
,
signs
a
statement
to
that
effect
.
the
fact
that
the
controlling
individual
indicates
that
he
or
she
is
speaking
in
his
or
her
personal
capacity
does
not
mean
,
however
,
that
incriminating
testimony
received
from
the
controlling
individual
cannot
be
used
against
the
represented
organization
.
if
the
controlling
individual
is
also
a
named
defendant
in
a
civil
enforcement
proceeding
or
has
been
arrested
or
charged
in
a
criminal
action
,
the
requirements
set
forth
in
§
776c
)
must
be
satisfied
before
any
substantive
communications
are
made
.
paragraph
(
f
:
multiple
representation
this
paragraph
makes
clear
that
the
proposed
regulations
should
not
be
construed
as
altering
existing
legal
and
ethical
rules
regarding
the
propriety
of
multiple
representation

by

this

provides
that
the

thus

neither

this

further
provides
the
framework
for
investigating
allegations
that
a

has
violated
these

it
provides
that
the
