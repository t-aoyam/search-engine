the
placement
of
the
warning
statement
on
the
principal
display
panel
of
the
retail
package
will
make
it
likely
that
the
warning
statement
will
be
seen
at
the
time
the
product
is
purchased
.
the
statement
will
inform
the
purchaser
of
the
products
potential
to
cause
poisoning
and
of
the
need
to
keep
the
product
away
from
children
when
it
is
brought
into
the
house
.
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
placement
of
the
warning
statement
on
the
principal
display
panel
is
necessary
to
fulfill
the
requirement
of
sections
403f
)
and
502c
)
of
the
act
,
that
information
required
to
appear
on
the
label
of
a
food
or
a
drug
be
placed
with
conspicuousness
(
as
compared
with
other
printed
matter
)
as
to
render
it
likely
to
be
read
by
the
ordinary
individual
under
customary
conditions
of
use
.
moreover
,
placement
of
the
warning
statement
on
the
principal
display
panel
is
consistent
with
the
requirement
that
fda
established
for
protein
product
warning
statements
discussed
previously
.
in
both
cases
,
the
products
in
question
could
cause
serious
,
even
lifethreatening
life
threatening
,
problems
if
misused
.
thus
,
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
the
standard
of
conspicuousness
established
in
the
protein
products
case
should
also
be
adopted
for
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
the
agency
tentatively
concludes
that
placement
of
the
warning
statement
on
the
immediate
container
is
also
necessary
to
fulfill
the
requirement
of
sections
403f
)
and
502c
)
of
the
act
because
,
under
customary
conditions
of
use
,
the
retail
container
is
frequently
disposed
of
,
and
individuals
other
than
the
purchaser
may
use
the
product
.
therefore
,
the
warning
statement
must
be
printed
on
the
immediate
container
if
this
statement
is
to
perform
its
function
throughout
the
life
of
the
product
.
regulating
the
placement
of
the
warning
is
consistent
with
other
labeling
requirements
that
the
agency
has
imposed
