microbial
contamination
three
conditions
must
exist
in
buildings
before
microbial
contamination
can
occur
:
high
humidity
(
over
60
,
appropriate
temperatures
(
varies
according
to
microbe
,
and
appropriate
growth
media
[

.
these
conditions
are
found
in
heating
,
ventilating
,
and
air
conditioning
(
hvac
)
systems
.
hvac
systems
provide
multiple
sites
for
microbes
to
grow
(
reservoir
)
and
also
the
means
to
disperse
the
microbes
throughout
the
ventilated
space
.
these
reservoirs
of
microbial
growth
,
if
allowed
to
proliferate
unchecked
,
can
lead
to
indoor
air
quality
problems
once
the
microbes
or
microberelated
microbe

products

such
as
endotoxins
,
are
dispersed

soaked
with
water
,
such
as
fiberglass
insulation
in
air
handlers
,
furnishings
and
fabrics
,
ceiling
tiles
,
and
carpeting
are
excellent
media
for
microbial
growth
