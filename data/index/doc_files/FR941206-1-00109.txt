chosen
,
for

affected

would
be
required
to
first
determine
:
(

)
its
coating

allowed
to
select
any
of
the
following
methods
for
compliance

may
choose
to
use
only
one
of
the
options

of
options

option
1
.
certification
of

or

,
asapplied
as

procedures
for
certifying
the
quantity
of

combined

compliance
with
the
vohap
content
limits
would
be
achieved
by
sampling
,
testing
,
and
certifying
the
voc
content
of
each
container
of
coating
,
as
applied
.
if
the
asapplied
as
applied
voc
content
is
less
than
or
equal
to
the
vohap
limit
in
table
1
,
the
coating
complies
.
option
2
.
coatings
to
which
thinning
solvent
will
not
be
added
if
thinning
solvents
will
not
be
added
to
the
coating
under
any
circumstances
,
the
affected
source
may
demonstrate
compliance
with
the
vohap
content
limit
by
certifying
the
asapplied
as
applied
voc
content
by
manufacturers
batch
.
the
as
-
applied
certification
may
be
based
on
a
coating
that
has
been
certified
by
the
manufacturer
as
to
the
assupplied
as
supplied
content
and
simply
requires
documentation
that
no
thinning
solvent
was
added
to
the
coating
.
no
additional
testing
would
be
necessary
.
all
painters
would
have
to
be
notified
that
no
thinning
solvent
may
be
added
to
the
coating
before
application
.
this
notification
may
be
accomplished
through
a
label
affixed
to
each
container
in
the
batch
or
through
another
means
of
notification
specified
in
the
sources
initial
notification
that
is
required
in
§
639b
)
of
subpart
a
of
the
general
provisions
.
other
means
of
notifying
painters
may
include
use
of
a
bar
coding
system
or
posting
of
a
list
of
coatings
that
should
not
have
thinning
solvents
added
.
this
option
is
the
least
burdensome
to
affected
sources
,
but
it
may
only
be
used
for
coatings
that
will
not
be
thinned
.
however
,
any
method
24
tests
on
individual
containers
of
coating
,
as
applied
,
that
show
noncompliance
with
the
standards
would
take
precedence
and
indicate
a
violation
