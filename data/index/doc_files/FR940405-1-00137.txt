in
the
proposed

(

fr

at
28248
to
28250
,
the
agency
tentatively
suggested
that
a
testing
method
similar
to
the
one
described
by
lowe
et
al
.
(
ref
.

)
could
be
used
to
demonstrate
that
a
sunscreen
drug
product
provides
protection
against
uva
radiation
.
this
method
uses

however
,
because
the
agency
did
not
have
enough
information
or
data
to
propose
a
method
for
determining
uva
protection
in
the
proposed
rule
,
the
agency
stated
that
a
method
should
be
developed
and
validated
in
the
same
manner
as
was
the
sunscreen
testing
procedure
for
protection
against
ultraviolet

(

)
radiation
(
ie

furthermore
,
the
agency
requested
comments
and
data
regarding
an
appropriate
testing
methodology
for
otc
sunscreen
drug
products
that
afford
uva
protection
.
the
agency
received
a
substantial
amount
of
comments
,
data
,
and
information
regarding
uva
ingredients
,
claims
,
and
testing
procedures
.
after
evaluating
the
submitted
material
,
the
agency
finds
that
there
are
two
basic
interrelated
questions
regarding
testing
procedures
for
determining
uva
protection
that
must
be
addressed
before
the
agency
can
complete
its
assessment
of
appropriate
uva
ingredients
and
claims
.
these
questions
are
:
(
1
)
what
action
spectrum
best
describes
the
biological
risk
of
uva
radiation
(
ie
,
which
ultraviolet
radiation
wavelengths
are
most
likely
to
cause
biological
damage
,
and
(

)
which
testing
procedure
best
defines
the
uva
protection
provided
by
a
sunscreen

product
?

action

for

uva
related
skin
damage
several
comments
discussed
the
appropriate
action
spectrum
for
biological
risk
associated
with
uva
radiation
.
one
comment
stated
that
,
in
developing
a
consensus
regarding
an
acceptable
assay
for
determining
the
uva
protection
provided
by
a
sunscreen
drug
product
,
the
specific
uva
effect
that
is
to
be
blocked
must
be
considered
.
these
effects
include
uva
erythema
,
uvainduced
uva
induced
drug
photosensitivity
,
immediate
pigment
darkening
,
delayed
tanning
,
or
other
effects
of
photodamage
.
one
comment
stated
that
several
action
spectra
describing
different
aspects
of
solarinduced
solar
induced
skin
damage
have
been
determined
in
a
number
of
different
species
and
cell
types
.
the
comment
described
these
aspects
as
photocarcinogenesis
,
dna
damage
,
photoaging
,
mutagenicity
,
and
immunosuppression
.
the
comment
maintained
that
each
action
spectrum
for
uvinduced
uv
induced
damage
closely
tracks
the
human
erythemal
action
spectrum
.
the
comment
stated
that
the
best
summary
of
the
biological
risk
of
uv
light
has
been
published
by
the
commission
internationale
de
leclairage
(
cie
)
(

the

embodies
the
comprehensive
,
yet

,
risks
to
human
skin
due
to
fullspectrum
full

uv
exposure
and
reflects
the
findings
of
the
action
spectra
biological
responses
to
uv
described
above
.
the
cie
hazard
spectrum
shows
that
the
damage
risk
for
uvb
at
290
nm
is
100
times
higher
than
that
at
320
nm
.
the
damage
risk
at
320
nm
is
100
times
higher
than
that
at
400
nm
.
the
damage
risk
at
320
nm
is
at
least
10
times
greater
than
the
damage
risk
at
340
nm
.
this
spectrum
shows
that
the
most
damage
potential
is
in
the
uvb
wavelengths
(
290
to
320
nm
,
followed
by
the
shorter
uva
wavelengths
(
320
to
340
nm
.
the
comment
cited
numerous
scientific
articles
and
submitted
action
spectra
to
support
its
statements
(
ref
.

.
another
comment
stated
that
although
protection
against
uva
is
important
,
it
is
not
as
important
as
protection
against
uvb
.
the
comment
argued
that
,
based
on
the
cie
hazard
spectrum
,
the
uvb
wavelengths
contribute
80
to
85
percent
of
the
damage
risk
in
sunlight
,
while
uva
contributes
15
to
20
percent
of
the
damage
risk
.
one
comment
stated
that
some
known
effects
on
humans
caused
by
uva
radiation
include
:
(
1
)
photoaging
of
the
skin
,
(
2
)
uvainduced
uva
induced
hypersensitivities
,
(
3
)
augmentation
of
skin
cancers
,
and
(
4
)
erythema
.
however
,
the
comment
noted
that
there
is
no
single
known
action
spectrum
to
describe
which
parts
of
the
uva
spectrum
are
most
active
in
causing
these
effects
.
therefore
,
the
comment
maintained
that
it
is
not
appropriate
to
use
the
uvaerythema
uva
erythema
action
spectrum
for
testing
purposes
.
the
comment
stated
that
uva
protection
should
be
assessed
in
relation
to
uvb
protection
and
that
the
assumption
should
be
made
that
all
wavelengths
are
equally
important
.
