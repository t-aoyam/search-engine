waiver
of
rulemaking
it
is
the
practice
of
the
secretary
to
offer
interested
parties
an
opportunity
to
comment
on
proposed
regulations
.
however
,
public
law
10366
requires
that
the
secretary
publish
a
notice
in
lieu
of
regulations
for
the
first
year
of
the
direct
loan
program
and
exempts
the

requirements

.
while

community
in
the
development
of

the

does
not

,
while

would
seriously
delay
the

therefore
,
the

finds
that
