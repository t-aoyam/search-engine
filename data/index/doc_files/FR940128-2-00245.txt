ii
.
implementation
of
subpart
i
as
applied
to
nrclicensed
nrc
licensed
facilities
other
than
nuclear
power
reactors
subpart
i
became
effective
on
11/16/1992
for
all
categories
of
facilities
licensed
by
nrc
or
agreement
states
except
for
commercial
nuclear
power
reactors
.
subpart
i
was
already
in
effect
prior
to
that
time
for
federal
facilities
not
operated
by
doe
.
at
this
time
,
epa
has
not
taken
final
administrative
action
concerning
the
rule
to
rescind
subpart
i
for
nrc
and
agreement
state
licensees
other
than
commercial
nuclear
power
reactors
which
it
proposed
on
12/01/1992
.
epa
is
recommending
that
nrc
make
certain
changes
in
its
regulatory
program
in
order
to
fully
support
the
substantive
finding
which
is
required
by
caa
section
112d9
)
before
epa
may
rescind
subpart
i
for
nrc
licensees
other
than
commercial
nuclear
power
reactors
.
epa
and
nrc
are
presently
engaged
in
consultations
concerning
specific
actions
which
would
strengthen
the
basis
for
rescission
of
subpart
i
for
this
category
,
but
it
is
unlikely
that
any
agreement
between
epa
and
nrc
concerning
additional
measures
could
be
implemented
quickly
.
while
the
rulemaking
concerning
rescission
is
still
pending
,
epa
advises
all
facilities
not
to
presume
that
epa
will
take
any
particular
action
in
that
rulemaking
and
to
proceed
in
the
meantime
with
all
legally
required
compliance
activities
.
because
subpart
i
first
took
effect
for
nrc
and
agreement
state
licensees
other
than
nuclear
power
reactors
near
the
end
of
1992
,
epa
has
determined
that
affected
facilities
were
not
required
to
demonstrate
compliance
with
subpart
i
for
calendar
year
1992
.
however
,
each
nrc
or
agreement
state
licensee
,
as
well
as
each
federal
facility
not
operated
by
doe
,
is
now
subject
to
all
provisions
of
subpart
i
.
each
affected
facility
must
demonstrate
compliance
for
calendar
year
1993
with
the
annual
emission
standard
set
forth
in
40
cfr
61
102
,
utilizing
the
procedures
specified
in
40
cfr
61
103
.
those
facilities
which
are
not
exempt
from
reporting
requirements
under
40
cfr
61
104
)
must
submit
the
annual
report
concerning
emissions
for
calendar
year
1993
required
by
40
cfr
61
104
)
to
epa
by
03/31/1994
.
facilities
that
are
unable
to
gather
the
necessary
information
and
report
to
epa
by
03/31/1994
should
request
an
extension
from
the
appropriate
epa

epa

consider

of
up
to

days
