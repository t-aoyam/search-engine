affected
sources
for
purposes
of
this
rulemaking
,
the
affected
source
would
be
considered
the
aggregate
of
all
operations
at
a
shipbuilding
facility
.
a
new
operation
at
a
shipbuilding
facility
would
not
be
considered
a
new
source
.
instead
,
it
may
qualify
as
a
modification
of
the
existing
source
.
the
proposed
standards
would
limit
vohap
emissions
from
indoor
and
outdoor
coating
operations
.
the
vohap
emissions
result
largely
from
solvent
evaporation
from
the
coatings
.
these
emissions
occur
during
application
and
drying
curing
.
due
to
the
size
of
ships
and
their
components
,
most
coatings
are
applied
outdoors
.
the
proposed
standards
would
also
reduce
vohap
emissions
from
handling
,
transfer
,
use
,
and
storage
of
vohapcontaining
vohap
containing
materials
through
work
practice
measures
.
these
emissions
also
occur
as
a
result
of
solvent
evaporation
.
b
.
standards
the
proposed
standards
would
be
the
same
for
new
and
existing
facilities
.
(
see
section
viib
.
for
discussion
on
the
basis
for
the
standards
)
the
proposed
standards
would
impose
limits
on
the
vohap
content
of
23
types
of
coatings
used
at
shipbuilding
facilities
.
(
see
section
viic
.
for
a
list
of
the
proposed
limits
)
the
limits
would
be
stated
in
terms
of
mass
of
vohap
per
volume
of
coating
less
water
and
less
negligibly
photochemically
reactive
(
exempt
)
compounds
.
compliance
with
the
vohap
limits
must
be
demonstrated
on
a
monthly
basis
.
the
proposed
standards
would
allow
for
an
alternative
means
of
compliance
other
than
using
compliant
coatings
,
if
approved
by
the
administrator
.
the
proposed
standards
would
also
require
that
all
handling
and
transfer
of
vohap
containing
materials
to
and
from
containers
,
tanks
,
vats
,
vessels
,
and
piping
systems
be
conducted
in
a
manner
that
minimizes
spills
and
other
factors
leading
to
emissions
.
in
addition
,
containers
of
thinning
solvent
or
waste
that
hold
any
vohap
must
be
normally
closed
(
to
minimize
evaporation
)
unless
materials
are
being
added
to
or
removed
from
them
.
c
.
compliance
dates
the
proposed
rule
would
require
compliance
for
existing
affected
sources
within
1
year
after
the
effective
date
of
the
rule
.
an
existing
unaffected
area
source
that
increases
its
hap
emissions
(
or
potential
to
emit
)
such
that
it
becomes
a
major
source
would
be
required
to
comply
within
1
year
after
becoming
a
major
source
.
any
new
or
reconstructed
sources
would
be
required
to
adhere
to
the
compliance
schedule
in
the
general
provisions
§
636b
)
of
subpart
a
without
any
modification
.
for
new
or
reconstructed
affected
sources
whose
startup
date
is
before
the
effective
date
of
the
rule
,
the
compliance
date
is
the
effective
date
of
the
rule
.
for
new
or
reconstructed
affected
sources
whose
startup
date
is
after
the
effective
date
of
the
rule
,
the
compliance
date
is
the
startup
date
.
a
new
unaffected
area
source
that
increases
its
emissions
(
or
potential
to
emit
)
such
that
it
becomes
a
major
source
would
be
required
to
comply
immediately
upon
becoming
a
major
source
.
d
.
compliance
procedures
the
proposed
rule
would
allow
affected
sources
to
choose
among
five
options
for
demonstrating
compliance
with
the
vohap
standards
.
their
choice
will
be
influenced
by
the
perceived
need
to
add
`
thinning
'
solvent
(
thinner
)
to
alter
the
viscosity
of
the
coating
in
order
to
spray
effectively
.
(
for
the
purposes
of
this
proposed
regulation
,
thinner
is
defined
as
any
liquid
material
added
to
a
coating
)
regardless
of
the
options
)
chosen
,
affected
sources
would
first
be
required
to
determine
the
coating
category
(
eg
,
general
use
,
air
flask
,
antenna
,
etc
,
the
applicable
vohap
limit
,
and
the
voc
content
for
each
batch
of
coating
received
from
the
manufacturer
.
