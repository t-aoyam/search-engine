a
notice
of

was
not
published
for
this

good
cause
exists
for
making
it
effective
in
less

30
days
after

publishing
an
nprm
and
delaying
its
effective

would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
since
immediate
action
is
needed
to
prevent
potential
hazards
to
the
tugs
barbara
richard
foss
and
the
barge
and
other
vessels
that
may
transit
the
area
.
less

30
days

was

thus
,
there
was
not
sufficient
time
to
publish
proposed

in

of
the

to

a

number
of
vessels
congregating
near
the
tugs

concern
is
justified
due
to
the
limited
maneuverability
of
the

for

safety
of
the
mariners
who

during
their
transit
as
well
as
other
vessels
in
the
immediate

this

will
be
enforced

regulatory
evaluation
this

not
a
significant
regulatory
action

order

an
assessment
of

the

expects
the
economic
impact

to
be
so
minimal
that
a

regulatory
evaluation

been
determined
that
the
