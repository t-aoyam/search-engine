definition
of
immediate
family
.
the
interpretation
presently
restricts
immediate
family
members
of
persons
enumerated
in
paragraph
2
(
persons
associated
with
broker
dealers
,
and
paragraphs
3
and
4
of
the
interpretation
(
persons
having
a
connection
to
the
offering
and
individuals
related
to
banks
,
insurance
companies
and
other
institutional
type
accounts
)
from
participating
in
hot
issue
distributions
.
the
interpretation
defines
immediate
family
members
very
broadly
and
includes
such
persons
as
father
,
mother
,
brother
-
and
sisterinlaw
sister
in
law
.
an
immediate
family
member
of
a
person
associated
with
a
broker
dealer
is
prohibited
from
purchasing
hot
issues
to
the
same
degree
as
the
associated
person
,
unless
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
the
associated
person
does
not
contribute
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
support
of
the
immediate
family
member
.
in
the
latter
circumstance
,
the
immediate
family
member
of
the
associated
person
may
purchase
a
hot
issue
under
the
same
conditions
as
those
persons
restricted
pursuant
to
paragraphs
3
and
4
of
the
interpretation
.
specifically
,
such
persons
may
purchase
hot
issues
if
:
(

)
the
securities
were
sold
to
such
persons
in
accordance
with
their
normal
investment
practice
with
the
member
making
the
distribution
;
and
(

)
the
securities
sold
are
insubstantial
and
not
disproportionate
in
amount
as
compared
to
sales
to
members
of
the
public
and
that
the
amount
sold
to
any
one
such
person
is
insubstantial
.
the
nasd
believes
that
in
its
present
form
,
the
immediate
family
member
provisions
often
place
inequitable
restrictions
on
a
person
with
a
fairly
attenuated
connection
to
a
restricted
person
named
in
the
interpretation
(
(
eg
,
the
sisterinlaw
sister
in
law
of
a
bank
vicepresident
vice
president
,
and
often
result
in
unduly
burdensome
compliance
difficulties
for
members
monitoring
whether
such
persons
are
restricted
or
become
restricted
.
the
nasd
believes
that
the
proposed
modifications
to
the
immediate
family
member
provisions
will
ensure
that
those
persons
with
a
substantial
nexus
to
a
restricted
person
will
be
similarly
restricted
under
the
interpretation
,
provide
a
clearer
test
for
nasd
members
in
determining
whether
such
persons
are
restricted
,
and
eliminate
the
interpretations
application
to
persons
not
intended
to
be
restricted
.
the
proposed
modifications
would
:
(
a
)
retain
the
investment
history
exemption
,
and
expand
it
to
include
the
use
of
investment
history
at
firms
other
than
the
member
making
the
allocation
.
the
burden
of
obtaining
such
information
would
remain
with
the
firm
making
the
sale
;
(
b
)
eliminate
the
immediate
family
restrictions
on
persons
other
than
those
associated
with
broker
dealers
(
categories
3
and
4
referenced
above
)
and
the
interpretation
would
only
apply
to
the
enumerated
individuals
in
those
categories
and
to
persons
who
are
supported
directly
or
indirectly
to
a
material
extent
by
the
restricted
person
;
(
c
)
with
respect
to
persons
associated
with
broker
dealers
,
continue
to
apply
the
immediate
family
restrictions
to
persons
supported
by
the
restricted
individual
and
to
allocations
by
the
restricted
individuals
firm
,
but
would
no
longer
prohibit
sales
to
nonsupported
supported
family
members
of
a
person
associated
with
a
broker
dealer
by
a
broker
dealer
that
does
not
employ
the
restricted
person
,
where
the
restricted
person
has
no
ability
to
control
the
allocation
of
the
hot
issue
.
there
would
continue
to
be
a
violation
if
it
could
be
determined
that
the
restricted
person
has
a
beneficial
interest
in
the
account
to
which
an
allocation
was
made

venture
capital
investors
.
the
nasd
believes
that
bona
fide
venture
capital
investors
should
be
allowed
to
purchase
a
hot
issue
to
maintain
their
percentage
ownership
in
an
entity
,
notwithstanding
that
the
venture
capital
investor
may
be
a
restricted
person
,
or
that
such
person
may
have
a
beneficial
interest
in
the
venture
capital
account
.
the
nasd
notes
that
the
venture
capital
investor
often
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
the
continued
viability
of
an
entity
prior
to
its
public
offering
,
and
that
such
an
investor
should
be
allowed
to
maintain
his
or
her
own
ownership
interest
after
the
entity
completes
its
public
offering
.
the
venture
capital
investor
,
in
order
to
purchase
the
hot
issue
without
implicating
the
interpretations
restrictions
,
would
have
to
meet
the
following
conditions
:
(
a
)
one
year
of
preexisting
ownership
in
the
entity
;
(
b
)
no
increase
in
the
investors
percentage
ownership
above
that
held
for
the
three
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
a
registration
statement
in
connection
with
the
initial
public
offering
;
(
c
)
a
lack
of
special
terms
in
connection
with
the
purchase
;
and
(
d
)
the
venture
capital
investor
shall
not
assign
,
sell
,
pledge
,
hypothecate
or
otherwise
dispose
of
the
securities
for
a
period
of
three
months
following
the
effective
date
of
the
registration
statement
in
connection
with
the
offering
.
the
nasd
believes
that
the
conditions
imposed
on
the
venture
capital
investor
ensure
that
the
securities
may
be
purchased
by
a
bona
fide
venture
capital
investor
who
has
had
an
ongoing
on
going
interest
in
an
entity
,
and
protect
against
any
attempt
to
circumvent
the
interpretations
restrictions
by
investing
in
an
entity
shortly
before
its
public
offering
.
