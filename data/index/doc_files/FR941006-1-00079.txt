in
determining
how
expenditures
made
as
of
a
certain
date
should
be
characterized
,
the
commission
might
consider
such
information
as
how
many
delegates
the
candidate
has
,
the
number
of
candidates
who
received
votes
in
each
of
the
candidates
partys
most
recent
state
primary
elections
or
other
state
nominating
procedures
,
the
relative
percentages
received
by
each
candidate
in
these
proceedings
,
and
whether
the
candidate
had
begun
to
focus
on
issues
raised
by
other
projected
general
election
candidates
and
his
or
her
comparability
with
such
candidates
.
the
commission
welcomes
suggestions
of
other
factors
that
could
prove
helpful
in
making
this
determination
.
another
question
involves
local
campaign
offices
that
continue
to
operate
after
a
states
primary
election
or
other
nominating
procedure
is
over
,
when
the
office
is
no
longer
focused
on
securing
the
nomination
in
that
state
.
the
commission
is
proposing
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
a
local
campaign
office
that
remains
open
more
than
30
days
after
a
states
primary
election
,
or
the
close
of
any
other
nomination
process
in
that
state
,
is
operating
in
support
of
the
general
election
campaign
.
the
commission
welcomes
comments
on
this
approach
,
as
well
as
suggestions
for
others
that
would
result
in
a
fair
attribution
of
these
expenditures
.
this
situation
becomes
more
complicated
when
applied
to
supplies
and
materials
.
the
commission
is
therefore
seeking
comments
on
how
such
items
should
be
treated
.
one
approach
would
be
to
require
an
inventory
of
everything
on
hand
,
including
campaign
materials
but
perhaps
excluding
items
below
a
certain
threshold
amount
,
as
of
the
doi
.
these
items
would
then
be
sold
to
the
general
election
at
cost
.
if
there
was
no
inventory
,
everything
purchased
or
delivered
in
the
last
60
days
before
the
doi
would
be
presumed
to
be
a
general
election
expense
.
the
commission
notes
that
this
approach
could
be
difficult
to
verify
,
since
the
inventory
would
be
at
a
point
in
time
which
could
not
be
recreated
.
nevertheless
,
it
is
important
that
primary
election
funds
not
be
used
to
subsidize
the
general
election
.
finally
,
the
commission
welcomes
comments
on
how
other
foods
and
or
services
,
such
as
campaignrelated
campaign
related
travel
and
media
expenses
,
should
be
treated
in
this
context
.
for
example
,
if
a
candidate
travels
to
a
state
where
the
primary
has
already
been
held
,
some
of
the
travel
could
be
for
fundraising
to
help
obtain
the
nomination
,
but
some
or
all
might
be
for
general
election
purposes
.
nothing
in
this
nprm
is
intended
to
revise
the
commissions
`
continuing
to
campaign
'
rules
set
forth
at
11
cfr
90344a3ii
.
these
rules
allow
a
candidate
who
is
no
longer
eligible
for
matching
funds
but
is
still
seeking
the
nomination
to
use
postdoi
doi
contributions
to
pursue
his
or
her
primary
campaigna
different
situation
than
that
addressed
in
this
proposal
.
the
commission
recognizes
that
,
under
unusual
circumstances
,
a
candidate
who
appears
to
have
been
eliminated
early
in
the
election
cycle
may
later
secure
the
nomination
.
as
is
currently
true
,
these
special
situations
would
be
evaluated
on
a
casebycase
case
by
case
basis
.
conversely
,
a
candidate
who
appears
to
have
secured
the
nomination
early
in
the
campaign
may
in
fact
fail
to
obtain
it
,
and
thus
not
qualify
for
general
election
funding
.
the
commission
is
less
concerned
with
this
possibility
,
as
the
focus
of
this
portion
of
the
rulemaking
is
on
how
certain
expenditures
should
be
treated
by
those
candidates
who
go
on
to
become
the
conventions
nominee
.

convention

the
commission
is
seeking
comments
on
whether
expenses
incurred
by
losing
primary
election
candidates
in
attending
their
partys
national
nominating
convention
should
be
considered
a
qualified
campaign
expense
under
11
cfr
90329
.
such
attendance
could
provide
a
defeated
candidate
the
opportunity
to
continue
to
fundraise
,
perhaps
to
campaign
for
the
vice
presidential
nomination
,
and
to
maintain
contact
with
his
or
her
pledged
convention
delegates
.
the
commission
notes
,
however
,
that

by

this
definition
seemingly
does
not
apply
to
those
no
longer

the
presidential

also
,
the
term
`

'
is
defined
as
`
an
individual
who
seeks
nomination
for
election
to
be
president

thus
does
not
on

include

seeking
