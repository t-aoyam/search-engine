the

addressed
the
issue
of
customer
limit
order
protection
in
the
nasdaq
market
.
in
the
manning
decision
,
the
commission
affirmed
,
based
on
principles
of
agency
law
,
an
nasd
determination
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trade
for
a
market
maker
to
trade
ahead
of
a
customer
limit
order
unless
the
customer
is
first
informed
of
the
firms
limit
order
policy
.
as
a
result
of
the
manning
decision
,
the
nasd
filed
a
proposed
rule
change
with
the
commission
stating
that
a
member
firm
will
not
be
deemed
to
have
violated
nasd
rules
of
fair
practice
if
it
provides
customers
with
a
statement
setting
forth
the
circumstances
in
which
the
member
firm
accepts
limit
orders
and
the
policies
and
procedures
that
the
firm
follows
in
handling
these
orders

after
full
consideration
of
the
concerns
articulated
in
the
comment
process
,
the
nasd
withdrew
its
rule
filing
proposing
the
disclosure
safe

approach
,
and
submitted
a
proposed
interpretation
to
its
rules
of
fair
practice
,
prohibiting
member
firms
from
trading
ahead
of
their
customers
'
limit
orders
in
their
market
making
capacity
.
the
division
of
market
regulations
market
2000
study
examined
this
practice
and
recommended
that
a
ban
apply
to
trading
ahead
of
all
customer
limit
orders
,
not
just
those
of
a
firms
own
customer
.
the
study
noted
that
the
adverse
effects
of
trading
ahead
exist
whether
the
customers
order
is
handled
by
the
customers
firm
or
by
another
market
maker

the
commission
approved
the
nasd
interpretation
on
06/29/1994
,
but
expressed
concern
that
the
prohibition
did
not
extend
to
trading
ahead
of

orders
of
other
firms
'
customers
that
have
