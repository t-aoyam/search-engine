options
for
retrieval
waste
can
be
retrieved
by
hydraulic
sluicing
,
pneumatic
or
mechanical
systems
.
hydraulic
sluicing
injects
liquid
into
the
tank
to
dislodge
and
mobilize
or
dissolve
the
waste
.
pumps
transfer
the
liquid
and
slurry
out
of
the
tank
.
mechanical
or
pneumatic
systems
are
placed
in
contact
with
the
waste
.
this
equipment
conditions
the
waste
and
transfers
it
out
of
the
tank
.
the
retrieved
waste
is
transferred
to
the
pretreatment
process
.
options
for
pretreatment
pretreatment
is
performed
to
separate
the
waste
into
its
highactivity
high
activity
and
lowactivity
low
activity
components
.
one
option
is
to
perform
no
pretreatment
.
another
option
is
to
limit
the
volume
of
waste
going
to
a
geologic
repository
by
pretreating
waste
to
accomplish
some
level
of
high
-
and
lowactivity
low
activity
waste
separation
.
two
bounding
alternatives
for
pretreating
tank
wastes
have
been
identified
,
corresponding
to
the
reasonable
limits
of
waste
pretreatment
(
such
as
evaporation
,
acid
digestion
,
nuclide
separation
,
ion
exchange
)
to
concentrate
the
radionuclides
in
a
smaller
volume
.
for
purposes
of
this
discussion
,
these
bounds
are
referred
to
as
`
minimal
'
and
`
extensive
'
pretreatment
.
the
pretreatment
bounds
may
also
influence
the
relative
volumes
of
high
-
and
lowactivity
low
activity
wastes
to
be
stabilized
and
stored
disposed
of
.
the
pretreated
waste
would
be
transferred
to
the
waste
immobilization
process
.
minimal
pretreatment
would
use
sludge
washing
to
separate
the
waste
into
a
smaller
volume
fraction
of
highactivity
high
activity
waste
(
containing
the
majority
of
radionuclide
activity
,
and
a
larger
volume
fraction
of
lowactivity
low
activity
waste
.
the
lowactivity
low
activity
waste
might
be
subjected
to
an
evaporation
step
to
reduce
the
volume
resulting
from
the
sludge
washing
process
.
extensive
pretreatment
would
use
advanced
solvent
extraction
methods
to
provide
the
maximum
level
of
radionuclide
partitioning
.
hazardous
nitrates
,
metals
,
and
other
selected
chemicals
would
be
removed
from
the
lowactivity
low
activity
waste
stream
,
and
the
volume
of
the
highactivity
high
activity
waste
fraction
would
be
minimized
.
options
for
immobilization
the
immobilization
would
stabilize
the
waste
coming
from
the
pretreatment
process
.
both
the
lowactivity
low
activity
waste
stream
and
the
highactivity
high
activity
waste
stream
would
be
stabilized
.
the
stabilized
waste
would
be
transferred
to
storage
or
disposal
.
highactivity
high
activity
waste
stabilization
options
include
vitrification
,
ceramic
forms
and
calcination
.
after
stabilizing
,
the
highactivity
high
activity
waste
fraction
would
comply
with
any
likely
waste
form
criteria
for
geologic
repository
acceptance
and
transportation
.
lowactivity
low
activity
waste
stabilization
options
include
vitrification
,
glass
cullet
in
a
sulfur
cement
and
cement
polymerbased
polymer
based
grout
.
the
current
plan
provides
that
the
encapsulated
cesium
and
strontium
would
meet
the
waste
form
criteria
for
geologic
repository
acceptance
and
transportation
.
the
first
option
is
overpacking
the
capsules
.
if
the
repository
waste
form
criteria
cannot
be
achieved
by
overpacking
,
the
capsules
would
be
stabilized
the
same
as
the
highactivity
high
activity
waste
fraction
above
(
eg
,
vitrification
,
ceramic
or
calcination
.
options
for
disposal
storage
the
disposal
options
include
disposal
onsite
,
disposal
offsite
and
interim
storage
pending
disposal
.
highactivity
high
activity
waste
disposal
options
include
emplacement
of
the
stabilized
waste
in
an
offsite
geologic
repository
or
in
interim
storage
onsite
pending
availability
of
an
offsite
geologic
repository
.
lowactivity
low
activity
waste
disposal
options
depend
on
the
stabilized
waste
form
and
include
:
burial
in
onsite
landfills
in
containers
;
burial
in
onsite
vaults
;
burial
onsite
in
steel
culverts
with
liners
and
leachate
collection
;
and
soil
melt
slurry
injection
to
a
landfill
.
some
of
these
options
would
accommodate
retrievability
if
desired
.
no
action
alternative
the
no
action
alternative
for
twrs
would
be
continued
storage
of
tank
wastes
and
encapsulated
cesium
and
strontium
without
preparation
for
disposal
.
however
,
the
no
action
alternative
includes
continued
maintenance
,
monitoring
,
and
safety
upgrades
.
no
action
also
includes
maintaining
the
lowactivity
low
activity
waste
grouting
facility
in
a
standby
condition
in
case
its
operation
is
necessary
before
new
dsts
are
available

to

the

the

the

.
doe
may
need
to
undertake
interim
actions
while
the
twrs
eis
is
being
prepared
.
any
interim
actions
undertaken
would
have
to
be
independently
justified
because
,
for
example
,
they
are
activities
needed
to
maintain
the
current
waste
management
system
;
collect
data
and
resolve
urgent
pretreatment
issues
;
or
protect
workers
,
the
public
and
the

.
any
interim
actions
would
be
actions
on
which
decisions
were
needed
prior
to
the
scheduled
completion
of
the
twrs
eis
.
none
of
the
interim
actions
would
prejudice
the
ultimate
decision
to
be
made
on
the
basis
of
the

because
they
would
be

regardless
of

in
