leading
to
this
action
concern
about
the
health
hazards
posed
by
occupational
exposure
to
environmental
tobacco
smoke
(
ets
)
prompted
three
public
interest
groups
to
petition
the
agency
in
05/19/1987
for
an
emergency
temporary
standard
under
section
6c
)
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
(
osh
)
act
,
29
usc
.
655c
.
the
american
public
health
association
and
public
citizen
submitted
a
joint
petition
;
action
on
smoking
and
health
(
ash
)
also
submitted
a
petition
.
the
petitions
requested
the
prohibition
of
smoking
in
most
indoor
workplaces
.
osha
determined
,
that
available
data
with
respect
to
exposures
were
insufficient
to
demonstrate
the
existence
of
a
`
grave
danger
'
within
the
meaning
of
section
6c
)
of
the
osh
act
,
from
workplace
exposure
to
ets
.
osha
denied
the
petitions
in
09/19/1989
but
continued
to
investigate
regulatory
options
.
in
10/19/1989
ash
filed
suit
in
the
us
.
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
for
review
of
oshas
denial
of
its
petition
for
an
emergency
temporary
standard
.
the
court
denied
ashs
petition
for
review
in
05/19/1991
,
finding
that
osha
has
reasonably
determined
that
it
could
not
sufficiently
quantify
the
workplace
risk
associated
with
tobacco
smoke
to
justify
an
emergency
temporary
standard
.
osha
issued
on
09/20/1991
,
a
request
for
information
(
rfi
)
(
56
fr

)
on
indoor
air
quality
problems
,
in
order
to
obtain
information
necessary
to
determine
whether
it
would
be
appropriate
and
feasible
to
pursue
regulatory
action
concerning
indoor
air
quality
(
iaq
.
issues
on
which
comments
were
requested
in
the
rfi
included
health
effects
attributable
to
poor
iaq
,
ventilation
systems
performance
,
exposure
assessment
,
and
abatement
methods
.
information
concerning
specific
contaminants
such
as
ets
and
bioaerosols
was
also
requested
.
in
03/19/1992
,
the
aflcio
afl
cio
petitioned
osha
to
promulgate
an
overall
iaq
standard
.
osha
responded
in
05/19/1992
that
such
a
standard
was
under
consideration
.
in
response
to
the
rfi
,
over
1200
comments
were
submitted
by
interested
persons
,
groups
,
unions
,
and
industries
.
issues
of
particular
concern
identified
in
the
comments
,
in
addition
to
health
effects
considerations
,
include
the
lack
of
ventilation
performance
standards
;
the
lack
of
worker
training
on
the
operation
and
maintenance
of
heating
ventilation
and
air
conditioning
(
hvac
)
systems
;
the
lack
of
pollutant
source
control
;
and
the
lack
of
available
technical
guidance
on
iaq
issues
and
control
techniques
.
of
the
comments
that
specifically
addressed
the
question
of
whether
osha
should
regulate
iaq
,
a
majority
(
75
)
indicate
support
for
regulation
.
of
those
that
commented
on
the
need
for
regulation
,
approximately
21
%
were
explicitly
in
favor
of
a
regulation
on
ets
,
more
than
41
%
were
in
favor
of
an
overall
iaq
regulation
,
and
approximately
13
%
were
in
favor
of
a
combined
iaq
regulation
.
numerous
comments
focused
on
the
adverse
health
effects
of
tobacco
smoke
and
of
general
indoor
air
pollution
.
the
health
effects
of
concern
relevant
to
both
tobacco
smoke
and
indoor
air
pollutants
ranged
from
the
acute
irritant
effects
to
cancer
.
comments
submitted
in
response
to
the
rfi
indicated
wide
support
for
a
regulatory
approach
that
would
focus
on
the
design
,
operation
and
maintenance
of
building
ventilation
systems
,
source
reduction
methodology
,
and
worker
information
and
training
programs
.
commenters
also
recommended
that
provisions
should
require
that
employers
receive
training
about
the
regulation
and
the
need
for
compliance
,
and
that
their
training
regarding
building
hvac
maintenance
and
operation
be
tailored
to
the
level
of
complexity
of
the
hvac
system
and
their
personal
degree
of
involvement
.
many
commenters
particularly
felt
that
regulation
of
iaq
was
necessary
to
eliminate
exposures
to
ets
in
the
workplace
.
commenters
urged
the
agency
to
either
ban
smoking
completely
from
the
workplace
or
allow
smoking
only
in
separately
ventilated
,
designated
smoking
areas
that
were
separate
from
work
areas
.
osha
believes
that
data
submitted
to
the
record
,
and
other
evidence
,
support
the
conclusion
that
air
contaminants
and
other
air
quality
factors
can
act
to
present
a
significant
risk
of
material
impairment
to
employees
working
in
indoor
environments
.
adverse
health
effects
associated
with
poor
iaq
may
include
sensory
irritation
,
respiratory
allergies
,
asthma
,
nosocomial
infections
,
humidifier
fever
,
hypersensitivity
pneumonitis
,
legionnaires
'
disease
,
and
the
signs
and
symptoms
characteristic
of
exposure
to
chemical
or
biologic
substances
such
as
carbon
monoxide
,
formaldehyde
,
pesticides
,
endotoxins
,
or
mycotoxins
.
the
agency
believes
that
available
data
support
proposing
regulation
of
iaq
,
including
exposure
to
ets
.
further
stimulus
for
this
determination
was
provided
by
conclusions
reached
in
a
report
published
in
12/19/1992
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
,
addressing
hazards
associated
with
exposure
to
ets
.
in
that
study
,
respiratory
health
effects
of
passive
smoking
:
lung
cancer
and
other
disorders
[

4311
,
epa
concluded
that
exposure
to
ets
presents
an
excess
risk
of
induction
of
cancer
in
humans
.
osha
has
submitted
this
proposed
standard
to
the
us

environmental
protection
agency
which
is
reviewing
it
in
detail
for
purposes
of

comments

for
the
reasons
noted
above
,
and
discussed
in
the
following
sections
,
osha
is
proposing
to
address
indoor
air
quality
problems
,
including
exposure
to

as
set
forth
in
