the
maintenance
written
plan
will
also
include
a
description
of
the
equipment
to
be
maintained
and
the
recommended
maintenance
procedures
and
frequency
of
performance
.
preferably
,
the
plan
should
contain
the
equipment
maintenance
manuals
issued
upon
completion
of
facility
construction
.
for
establishments
in
buildings
with
natural
ventilation
,
employers
will
develop
a
plan
to
assure
that
windows
,
doors
,
vents
,
stacks
and
other
portals
designed
or
used
for
natural
ventilation
are
in
operable
condition
.
the
cost
associated
with
compiling
such
information
will
vary
depending
on
the
size
of
the
establishment
building
,
the
complexity
of
the
building
system
,
the
extent
to
which
such
information
is
already
available
,
and
type

in
some
cases
some
establishments
especially
the
large
ones
may
already
have
developed
such
information
.
for
example
,
in
1986
,
ibm
initiated
a
program
by
first
evaluating
building
design
,
operation
and
maintenance
and
as
a
result
,
an
iaq
program
was
devised
to
include
:
a
model
operation
maintenance
and
iaq
awareness
program
for
building
operation
maintenance
personnel
,
an
updated
building
commissioning
document
and
appropriate

agreements

there
are
no
data
on
the
number
of
establishments
with

programs
.
based
on
information
in
the
docket
,
osha
assumed
that
95
percent
of
all
establishments
are
required
to
develop
the
iaq
compliance
program
information
.
in
addition
,
employers
are
required
to
:
(

)
identify
a
designated
person
who
is
given
the
responsibility
of
the
iaq
compliance
program
,
(

)
keep
written
records
of
employee
complaints
of
buildingrelated
building
related
illness
and
maintenance
records
,
and
(

)
set
up
procedures
to
be
utilized
during
renovation
and
modeling
to
minimize
degradation
of
the
indoor
air
quality
of
employees
performing
such
activities
and
employees
in

areas
of
