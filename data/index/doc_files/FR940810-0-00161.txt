repair
.
as
in
the
existing
osha
asbestos
standard
for
general
industry
,
automotive
repair
work
is
regulated
in
revised
§
1910
1001
.
in
paragraph
(
f3
)
employers
performing
six
or
more
brake
or
clutch
jobs
per
week
are
required
to
use
a
negative
pressure
enclosure
hepa
vacuum
method
,
a
low
pressure
wet
cleaning
method
,
or
an
alternate
method
proven
to
achieve
results
equivalent
to
those
for
the
enclosure
hepa
vacuum
method
.
osha
assessed
the
extent
to
which
control
practices
are
being
applied
during
brake
and
clutch
repair
in
the
automotive
services
industry
and
identified
the
additional
resources
needed
to
reach
full
compliance
with
the
revised
standard
.
based
on
oshas
and
consads
assessment
of
current
industry
practice
,
osha
believes
that
only
a
small
fraction
of
auto
repair
shops
perform
fewer
than
six
brake
or
clutch
inspections
per
week
[
osha
,
1994
.
thus
,
osha
anticipates
that
few
shops
will
qualify
for
the
exemption
from
engineering
controls
mandated
in
revised
appendix
f
.
osha
and
consad
[
osha
,
1994
]
estimate
that
65
percent
of
brake
shops
currently
use
wet
methods
and
solvent
spray
systems
during
brake
and
clutch
work
.
under
the
revised
standard
,
these
shops
would
have
to
switch
to
one
of
the
fiber
control
methods
permitted
in
appendix
f
.
for
this
cost
analysis
,
osha
assumed
most
of
the
shops
currently
not
in
compliance
with
the
revised
rule
,
will
adopt
the
low
pressure
wet
cleaning
method
as
the
least
expensive
option
permitted
in
the
revised
standard
.
osha
estimates
that
incremental
expenditures
for
equipment
,
supplies
and
labor
time
will
total
$
112
million
per
year
.
comment
in
the
record
[
ex
.
l16261
]
points
to
the
potential
for
substantial
cost
offsets
from
use
of
the
low
pressure
wet
cleaning
method
.
these
cost
offsets
include
the
reduced
need
for
solvent
;
reductions
in
costs
associated
with
housekeeping
and
with
laundering
and
disposal
of
contaminated
rags
and
other
articles
;
and
improved
operating
efficiencies
.
because
of
potential
cost
savings
,
use
of
the
low
pressure
wet
cleaning
method
has
grown
in
recent
years
.
moreover
,
concern
over
the
effect
of
111
trichloroethane
on
the
ozone
layer
has
led
to
a
phaseout
phase
out
of
the
solvent
,
forcing
brake
shops
to
discontinue
use
of
the
solvent
spray
method
.
of
concern
to
occupational
health
specialists
is
the
regular
use
of
solvents
among
a
workforce
with
minimal
protection
from
exposures
.
in
sum
,
osha
believes
that
cost
offsets
and
environmental
and
health
concerns
combine
to
mitigate
the
direct
costs
facing
brake
shops
who
must
switch
to
alternative
asbestos
control
systems
.
current
work
practices
.
in
addition
to
work
practices
in
automotive
services
that
meet
the
revised
standard
,
certain
work
practices
that
were
required
by
oshas
previous
standard
with
a
pel
of
2
f
cc
,
and
are
required
by
the
current
standard
,
as
well
as
by
the
proposed
revisions
to
the
current
standard
(
eg
.
wet
handling
and
the
collection
,
disposal
,
and
labeling
of
wastes
in
sealed
,
impermeable
bags
,
are
also
not
identified
as
additional
costs
.
osha
believes
that
wet
methods
(
to
the
extent
that
they
are
feasible
,
and
the
use
of
hepa
vacuums
for
housekeeping
in
primary
and
secondary
manufacturing
,
are
already
widely
in
use
.
total

for

to
derive
estimates
of
the
annual
incremental
compliance
costs
for
the
industry
process
groups
affected
by
the
revised
general
industry
standard
,
the
estimated
unit
cost
factors
were
first
multiplied
by
estimates
of
the
resources
necessary
to
achieve
compliance
for
that
industry
process
group
.
these
gross
annual
cost
estimates
were
then
adjusted
to
account
for
current
compliance
rates
which
were
first
projected
in
the
1986
ria
[
osha
,
1986
]
and
were
modified
as
a
result
of
compliance
with
the
excursion
limit
rule
in
1988
[
osha
,
1988
]
and
evidence
from
the
rulemaking
record
.
for
each
of
the
manufacturing
processes
in
the
affected
industries
,
consad
estimated
the
number
of
plants
with

above
the

the

the

and

these
estimates
are
based
on
:
the
number

in

,
determined
by

from
information
presented

the

examining
compliance
costs
by

,
it
can
be
seen
that
the
largest
compliance
expenditures
will
be
in
auto

(
112

,
followed
by
friction
