this
is
a

to
the

it

osha
and
most
participants
in
the
rulemaking
agreed
that
only
the
major
,
more
performance
oriented
criteria
should
be
made
mandatory
.
these
criteria
are
set
out
in
paragraph
(

of
this
section
.
in
addition
,
this
appendix
includes
these
mandatory
specifications
and
procedures
in
its
guidelines
in
order
to
make
this
appendix
coherent
and
helpful
.
the
mandatory
nature
of
the
criteria
which
appear
in
the
regulatory
text
is
not
changed
because
they
are
included
in

`

appendix
.
similarly
,
the
additional
criteria
and
procedures
included
as
guidelines
in
the
appendix
,
do
not
become
mandatory
because
mandatory
criteria
are
also
included
in
these
comprehensive
guidelines
.
in
addition
,
none
of
the
criteria
,
both
mandatory
and
recommended
,
are
meant
to
specify
or
imply
the
need
for
use
of
patented
or
licensed
methods
or
equipment
.
recommended
specifications
included
in
this

should
not
discourage
the
use
of
creative

includes

as
applied
to
the
specific
variables

the
information
needed
to

will
be
useful
in

and
in

thus
,
although
the
standard
does
not
explicitly
require
the
preparation
of
a
written
asbestos
removal
plan
,
the
usual
constituents
of
such
a
plan
,
ie
,
a
description
of
the
enclosure
,
the
equipment
,
and
the
procedures
to
be
used
throughout
the
project
,
must
be
determined
before
the
enclosure
can
be
erected
.
the
following
information
should
be
included
in
the
planning
of
the
system
:
a
physical
description
of
the
work
area
;
a
description
of
the
