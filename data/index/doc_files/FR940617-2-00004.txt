on
behalf

valdez
trustee

published

eis
on

restoration
plan
.
this
was
later
revised
on
01/14/1994
(
59
fr
23522353
.
since
then
the
trustee
council
developed
a
draft
restoration
plan
which
has
become
the
proposed
action
for
the
analysis
conducted
in
the
deis
.
b
.
draft
restoration
plan
the
proposed
action
(
draft
restoration
plan
)
consists
of
nine
policy
statements
,
a
discussion
of
categories
of
restoration
actions
and
broad
objectives
for
injured
resources
.
the
policies
for
identifying
and
conducting
restoration
actions
are
:
1
.
the
restoration
program
will
take
an
ecosystem
approach
.
2
.
restoration
activities
may
be
considered
for
any
injured
resource
or
service
.
3
.
most
restoration
activities
will
occur
within
the
spill
area
.
however
,
restoration
activities
outside
the
spill
are
,
but
within
alaska
,
may
be
considered
when
the
most
effective
restoration
actions
for
an
injured
migratory
population
are
in
a
part
of
its
range
outside
the
spill
area
or
when
the
information
acquired
from
research
and
monitoring
activities
outside
the
spill
area
will
be
important
for
restoration
or
understanding
injuries
within
the
spill
area
.
4
.
restoration
activities
will
emphasize
resources
and
services
that
have
not
recovered
.
resources
and
services
will
be
enhanced
,
as
appropriate
,
to
promote
restoration
.
restoration
projects
should
not
adversely
affect
the
ecosystem
.
5
.
projects
designed
to
restore
or
enhance
an
injured
service
must
have
a
sufficient
relationship
to
an
injured
resource
;
must
benefit
the
same
user
group
that
was
injured
;
and
,
should
be
compatible
with
the
character
and
public
uses
of
the
area
.
