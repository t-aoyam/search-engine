the
former
`
initial
monitoring
'
provisions
allowed
use
of
historic
data
.
osha
now
requires
the
evaluation
of
data
from
earlier
asbestos
jobs
to
estimate
exposures
on
new
jobs
.
however
,
the
`
data
'
reviewed
are
more
than
air
monitoring
results
.
this
record
has
convinced
the
agency
that
consideration
of
factors
in
successfully
controlling
asbestos
exposures
needs
to
be
a
part
of
the
assessment
.
in
addition
to
measurement
results
,
the
assessment
must
review
relevant
controls
and
conditions
,
factors
that
influence
the
degree
of
exposure
.
these
include
,
but
are
not
limited
to
,
the
degree
and
quality
of
supervision
and
of
employee
training
,
techniques
used
for
wetting
the
acm
in
the
various
circumstances
encountered
,
placing
and
repositioning
the
ventilation
equipment
,
and
impacts
due
to
weather
conditions
.
the
assessment
therefore
must
be
based
on
the
competent
persons
review
of
all
aspects
of
the
employers
performance
doing
similar
jobs
.
only
if
similar
controls
are
used
and
the
work
supervised
by
the
same
or
similarly
trained
personnel
,
may
past
data
be
relied
on
.
in
addition
,
the
results
of
initial
monitoring
required
if
feasible
,
must
inform
the
competent
persons
assessment
.
judgment
of
the
`
competent
person
'
is
required
when
reviewing
records
of
past
work
.
for
example
,
even
where
an
employers
earlier
glove
bag
removals
produced
some
exposures
above
the
pel
,
if
more
recent
glove
bag
removals
by
the
same
crew
show
no
exceedances
,
the
`
competent
person
'
may
be
warranted
in
predicting
that
the
current
job
performed
by
the
same
crew
will
be
well
controlled
and
exposures
will
not
exceed
the
pels
.
the
other
basis
allowed
for
an
initial
exposure
assessment
is
`
objective
data
'
to
show
that
it
is
,
in
effect
,
impossible
for
a
job
to
result
in
excessive
exposures
.
the
1986
standard
,
1926
58
,
paragraph
(
f2ii
,
allowed
such
data
to
demonstrate
that
the
`
product
or
material
containing
asbestos
cannot
release
*
*
*
*
*
*
(
excessive
)
concentrations
*
*
*
*
*
'
since
the
record
of
this
proceeding
shows
that
almost
all
asbestos
products
may
in
time
become
hazardous
,
if
for
example
,
their
matrix
becomes
disturbed
,
the
activity
,
as
well
as
the
material
,
is
the
exposurelimiting
exposure
limiting
factor
.
osha
therefore
now
allows
a
showing
that
a
specific
activity
involving
a
product
is
incapable
of
producing
exceedances
.
the
`
objective
data
'
must
demonstrate
that
under
`
the
work
conditions
having
the
greatest
potential
for
releasing
asbestos
'
an
activity
coupled
with
a
specific
material
,
simply
cannot
result
in
excessive
concentrations
.
osha
cannot
predict
all
the
combinations
of
activity
and
product
which
will
meet
this
test
.
osha
believes
instead
that
construction
employers
should
be
given
the
responsibility
for
making
these
determinations
for
their
particular
work
.
however
,
on
the
record
of
this
proceeding
,
they
would
appear
to
be
limited
to
class
iv
activities
,
or
certain
class
iii
activities
such
as
limited
removal
of
intact
asbestos
containing
gaskets
using
wet
methods
and
containment
methods
.
osha
notes
that
under
no
conditions
can
a
class
i
removal
qualify
for
this
exemption
;
based
on
the
record
of
this
rulemaking
,
every
removal
activity
involving
tsi
and
surfacing
acm
is
capable
of
releasing
fibers
above
the
pel
.
there
are
separate
provisions
regarding
a
`
negative
initial
exposure
assessment
'
which
is
a
demonstration
that
the
activity
involving
the
asbestos
material
is
unlikely
under
all
foreseeable
conditions
to
result
in
concentrations
above
the
pels
.
the
competent
person
must
exercise
judgment
in
performing
these
exposure
assessments
.
for
example
,
if
initial
monitoring
is
evaluated
the
first
days
measurements
which
reflect
setup
set
activities
may
not
adequately
predict
later
exposures
on
a
removal
job
.
the
competent
person
should
examine
both
the
first
days
exposures
and
comparable
full
job
exposure
data
from
other
comparable
jobs
,
before
a
conclusion
is
reached
that
exposures
on
that
job
will
not
exceed
the
pels
.
in
large
measure
,
the
required
bases
for
making
a
`
negative
exposure
assessment
'
in
the
revised
construction
standard
are
the
same
criteria
which
would
,
under
the
1986
standard
,
have
allowed
an
employer
to
claim
an
exemption
from
initial
monitoring
based
on
`
historic
data
'
the
standard
makes
it
more
difficult
to
base
an
initial
exposure
assessment
on
historic
data
than
did
the
previous
provision
for
initial
determination
.
now
,
the
assessment
must
consider
,
the
experience
and
training
of
the
crews
.
therefore
,
the
standard
now
requires
that
a
negative
exposure
assessment
must
compare
crews
with
comparable
experience
and
training
,
an
employer
cannot
compare
untrained
and
inexperienced
crews
.
and
no
`
negative
exposure
assessment
'
can
be
made
if
the
crews
which
disturb
asbestos
in
the
current
job
are
untrained
.
osha
believes
that
a
major
factor
in
the
effectiveness
of
all
control
systems
for
removing
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
materials
is
the
experience
and
training
of
the
contractor
and
employees
.
evidence
in
the
record
shows
dramatic
reductions
in
exposure
levels
as
untrained
employees
learned
proper
glove
bag
techniques
(
see
eg
,
the
niosh
study
,
ex
.
125
.
the
lack
of
a
`
negative
exposure
determination
'
usually
indicates
that
workers
are
not
experienced
trained
or
that
a
job
is
complex
.
in
such
situations
,
additional
protections
,
less
dependent
on
experience
of
the
workers
,
or
the
complexity
of
the
job
,
should
be
required
.
thus
,
critical
barriers
are
required
in
all
class
i
and
ii
work
,
and
for
class
iii
work
,
plastic
barriers
are
required
,
where
negative
exposure
assessments
are
not
produced
.
if
the
employer
cannot
assure
that
levels
will
be
minimized
,
protection
against
migration
of
asbestos
dust
must
be
provided
.
similarly
,
if
excessive
levels
are
possible
,
employees
in
all
classes
must
be
protected
by
respirator
use
and
the
standard
so
requires
.
osha
believes
its
approach
balances
the
concern
that
asbestos
exposure
levels
vary
from
job
to
job
and
may
be
nonpredictive
predictive
of
future
levels
with
the
agencys
knowledge
gained
from
longterm
long
term
enforcement
of
the
asbestos
standard
,
that
different
employers
have
different
`
track
records
'
the
negative
initial
exposure
assessment
provisions
require
consideration
of
factors
which
have
been
identified
as
influencing
the
variability
of
results
.
in
fact
,
one
commenter
stated
that
`
*
*
*
*
*
it
is
invalid
to
predict
that
any
particular
operation
is
always
below
the
pel
'
identified
critical
contributing
variables
as
`
the
materials
,
work
practices
and
experience
of
the
crew
'
(
ex
.
752
.
osha
is
requiring
the
`
negative
exposure
assessment
'
to
be
based
on
these
,
among
other
,
factors
.
osha
emphasizes
that
a
`
negative
exposure
assessment
'
does
not
predict
exposure
levels
beyond
a
particular
job
.
a
new
assessment
must
be
produced
each
time
another
job
is
undertaken
.
employers
may
evaluate
repetitive
operations
with
highly
similar
characteristics
,
as
one
job
,
such
as
cable
pulling
in
the
same
building
,
so
long
as
the
historic
data
used
also
reflect
repetitive
operations
of
the
same
duration
and
frequency
.
