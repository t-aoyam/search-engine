indicated
that
the
regulations
need
to
be
modified
to
accommodate
people
who
may
still
have
longline
permit
applications
pending
under
the
moratorium
.
response
(

:
there
were
no
permit
applications
pending
when
the
moratorium
ended
,
therefore
no
change
was
necessary
in
the
regulations
to
respond
to
this
comment
.
comment
(

:
the
council
indicated
that
the
language
of
the
permit
eligibility
criteria
concerning
the
linkage
between
longline
permits
and
northwestern
hawaiian
islands
(
nwhi
)
lobster
limited
entry
permits
needed
revision
to
be
consistent
with
the
intent
of
the
council
.
that
is
,
the
criteria
in
the
proposed
rule
would
not
have
afforded
eligibility
for
a
hawaii
longline
limited
entry
permit
to
someone
who
,
at
the
end
of
the
moratorium
,
was
the
last
holder
of
record
of
a
moratorium
longline
limited
entry
permit
and
held
a
northwest
hawaiian
islands
(
nwhi
)
lobster
limited
entry
permit
,
both
of
which
were
obtained
from
another
party
.
it
was
the
councils
intent
that
a
person
who
obtained
both
permits
from
another
party
would
thus
be
eligible
for
a
hawaii
longline
limited
entry
permit
based
on
`
the
lobster
fishery
criterion
'
referred
to
in
amendment
7
.
response
(
6
:
a
new
paragraph
§
6859b2iv
)
has
been
added
to
be
consistent
with
the
councils
intent
.
it
is
estimated
that
five
longline
permit
holders
will
be
affected
by
this
change
by
qualifying
for
new
permits
under
these
criteria
.
changes
from
the
proposed
rule
an
item
inadvertently
not
discussed
in
the
proposed
rule
is
that
initial
permit
decisions
are
made
by
the
chief
,
fisheries
management
division
,
southwest
region
,
nmfs
.
this
final
rule
includes
a
provision
for
appeals
of
permit
decisions
to
the
regional
director
.
experience
in
the
moratorium
program
indicates
a
need
for
an
appeal
process
to
review
decisions
that
applicants
believe
are
incorrect
or
based
on
faulty
interpretation
of
facts
.
the
definition
of
`
length
overall
'
of
a
vessel
has
been
revised
to
mean
only
the
horizontal
distance
between
the
foremost
part
of
the
stem
and
the
aftermost
part
of
the
stern
.
the
length
overall
does
not
include
fittings
or
attachments
that
extend
beyond
these
two
points
,
including
bowsprits
,
rudders
,
or
outboard
motor
brackets
.
references
in
the
proposed
definition
to
other
vessel
length
measurements
appearing
in
us
.
coast
guard
or
state
vessel
registration
documents
have
been
removed
because
they
could
have
resulted
in
the
use
of
different
vessel
length
measurement
systems
.
as
revised
,
the
definition
provides
a
consistent
and
uniform
method
of
determining
vessel
length
for
all
vessels
participating
in
the
fishery
;
it
is
the
same
method
of
length
measurement
used
in
many
other
federally
regulated
fisheries
.
under
this
definition
,
the
longest
vessel
active
in
the
fishery
in
the
moratorium
is
101
feet
(
308
m
)
rather
than
93
feet
(
28
meters
,
as
described
in
the
preamble
to
the
proposed
rule
.
the
eligibility
criteria
for
issuance
of
a
hawaii
limited
entry
permit
in
§
6859b2
)
were
modified
.
as
noted
in
response
to
comment
number
6
the
linkage
between
longline
permits
and
nwhi
lobster
limited
entry
permits
was
modified
to
be
consistent
with
council
intent
.
also
,
several
moratorium
permits
were
invalidated
due
to
the
sinking
or
destruction
of
vessels
.
the
holders
of
these
permits
had
been
active
during
the
moratorium
period
and
therefore
would
qualify
for
permits
under
the
new
program
.
by
focussing
on
the
last
holder
of
record
of
limited
entry
permits
issued
under
the
moratorium
,
the
final
rule
provides
that
these
individuals
will
qualify
for
new
permits
,
consistent
with
the
intent
of
amendment
7
.
a
prohibition
(
6859a4
)
was
added
to
require
that
necessary
permits
be
on
board
vessels
and
available
for
inspection
by
an
authorized
agent
unless
the
vessel
was
at
sea
when
the
permit
was
issued
,
in
which
case
the
permit
must
be
on
board
the
vessel
on
the
next
trip
.
the
requirement
for
the
permit
to
be
on
board
the
vessel
was
in
effect
during
the
moratorium
,
but
was
inadvertently
omitted
from
the
proposed
rule
.
