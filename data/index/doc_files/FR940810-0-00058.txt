in
the
1990
proposal
,
osha
did
not
propose
an
action
level
based
on
its
tentative
conclusion
that
workplace
asbestos
concentrations
below
the
pel
could
not
be
reliably
and
reproducibily
measured
(
55
fr
29722
.
the
agency
asked
for
comment
on
the
advisability
of
setting
an
action
level
of
0
05
f
cc
,
and
specifically
asked
whether
the
methodology
for
measuring
airborne
asbestos
levels
had
advanced
sufficiently
to
allow
reliable
and
reproducible
measurements
at
that
level
.
evidence
subsequently
submitted
to
the
rulemaking
record
indicated
that
levels
as
low
as
0
05
f
cc
could
not
be
consistently
measured
reliably
.
the
rulemaking
reinforces
oshas
tentative
conclusion
that
workplace
asbestos
levels
of
0
05
f
cc
cannot
be
measured
reliably
(

,

.
because
employers
cannot
obtain
reliable
and
reproducible
measurements
of
airborne
asbestos
levels
at
concentrations
of
0
05
f
cc
,
it
would
be
infeasible
to
base
training
and
medical
surveillance
requirements
on
worker
exposure
to
asbestos
at
such
a
level
.
osha
therefore
declines
to
establish
an
action
level
of
0
05
f
cc
.
osha
recognizes
in
some
circumstances
the
general
advantages
of
an
action
level
,
and
if
future
monitoring
technology
is
developed
which
would
allow
reliable
,
consistent
determinations
at
lower
fiber
levels
,
osha
will
reconsider
whether
an
action
level
would
be
appropriate
for
the
asbestos
standard
and
whether
action
under
section
(
6b7
)
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
which
directs
osha
to
`
make
appropriate
modification
in
the
*
*
*
*
*
*
requirements
relating
to
*
*
*
*
*
*
monitoring
or
measuring
*

*
*
as
may
be
warranted
by
experience
,
information
,
or
medical
or
technological
developments
acquired
subsequent
to
the
promulgation
of
the
relevant
standard
'
is
appropriate
.
the
agency
has
,
however
,
included
provisions
that
require
training
and
medical
surveillance
of
employees
exposed
below
the
pel
.
thus
,
like
standards
that
contain
an
action
level
,
these
standards
use
training
and
medical
surveillance
to
reduce
the
residual
significant
risk
that
remains
at
the
pel
.
the
general
industry
standard
requires
that
all
employees
who
work
in
areas
where
acm
or
pacm
is
present
be
given
a
prescribed
level
of
awareness
training
.
the
construction
and
shipyard
standards
require
training
of
all
workers
who
install
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
products
and
all
workers
who
perform
class
i
,
class
ii
,
class
iii
,
and
class
iv
work
.
these
training
requirements
assure
that
all
employees
who
are
potentially
exposed
to
more
than
de
minimis
concentrations
of
asbestos
can
recognize
conditions
and
activities
that
can
lead
to
asbestos
exposure
,
know
of
the
hazards
associated
with
asbestos
exposure
,
and
are
trained
to
utilize
the
means
prescribed
by
the
standard
to
minimize
their
exposure
.
with
respect
to
medical
surveillance
,
the
construction
and
shipyard
standards
require
medical
surveillance
of
all
workers
who
,
for
a
combined
total
of
30
days
per
year
or
more
,
engage
in
class
i
,
ii
,
or
iii
work
,
or
who
are
exposed
above
the
pel
or
excursion
limit
.
additionally
employees
who
wear
negative
pressure
respirators
are
provided
with
medical
surveillance
.
the
general
industry
standard
requires
medical
surveillance
of
all
workers
exposed
above
the
pel
or
excursion
level
,
with
no
30day
day
per
year
limitation
.
in
crafting
these
provisions
,
osha
has
attempted
to
assure
that
those
workers
for
whom
medical
surveillance
will
provide
relevant
information
and
benefit
are
entitled
to
it
.
in
construction
and
shipyard
work
,
employees
who
do
not
engage
in
class
i
,
ii
,
or
iii
work
are
unlikely
to
be
exposed
above
0
05
f
cc
(
the
potential
`
action
level
)
because
the
work
practices
mandated
in
the
standard
should
result
in
negligible
asbestos
exposure
to
workers
who
do
not
specifically
engage
in
asbestosrelated
asbestos
related
work
.
employees
who
engage
in
only
class
iv
work
also
should
not
be
exposed
above
0
05
f
cc
because
of
the
lower
asbestos
exposures
associated
with
such
work
.
osha
therefore
believes
that
the
construction
and
shipyard
provisions
target
medical
surveillance
where
it
is
needed
.
in
general
industry
,
the
vast
majority
of
workers
who
are
exposed
below
the
pel
will
also
be
exposed
below
0
05
f
cc
.
the
work
practices
mandated
for
brake
and
clutch
repair
,
by
far
the
largest
general
industry
segment
subject
to
the
standard
,
should
result
in
virtually
all
such
workers
being
exposed
below
0
05
f
cc
.
another
large
general
industry
segment
,
custodial
workers
,
will
also
be
generally
exposed
below
0
05
f
cc
.
while
some
small
number
of
workers
in
both
categories
as
well
as
in
the
manufacturing
of
asbestos
products
may
be
exposed
between
0
05
f
cc
and
0
10
f
cc
on
some
days
,
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
reliable
and
reproducible
measurements
at
those
levels
makes
it
difficult
to
identify
those
workers
accurately
.
therefore
,
if
medical
surveillance
were
triggered
by
exposure
above
0
05
f
cc
,
the
employees
subject
to
such
surveillance
would
likely
be
chosen
on
the
basis
of
the
vagaries
of
the
monitoring
process
rather
than
on
any
realistic
assessment
of
the
risk
that
they
face
.
osha
therefore
concludes
that
it
would
be
infeasible
,
and
would
not
reduce
significant
risk
,
to
require
medical
surveillance
for
workers
in
general
industry
exposed
below
the
pel
or
excursion
limit
.
