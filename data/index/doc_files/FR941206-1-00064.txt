in

to
determine
the
mact

for

wood

industry
,
the
epa
surveyed
more
than
850
wood
furniture
manufacturing
operations
.
facilities
of
all
sizes
operating
under
each
of
the
sic
codes
of
interest
were
surveyed
in
order
to
get
a
representative
sampling
of
the
industry
.
responses
were
received
from
more
than
300
sources
,
91
of
which
were
determined
to
be
major
sources
.
information
provided
by
plants
included
the

(

)
for
each
finishing

,
cleaning

and

containing

that
was
used
at

,
as
well
as

on

,

.
as
discussed
in
section
vid
,
in
evaluating
the
data
collected
from
industry
on
finishing
operations
,
the
format
that
seemed
technically
feasible
and
most
flexible
for
the
entire
source
category
was
an
emission
limit
expressed
in
terms
of
pounds
of
volatile
hap
(
vhap
)
emitted
per
pound
of
solids
used
(
lb
vhap
lb
solids
[

vhap

.
thus
,
the
mact
floor
for
finishing
operations
at
existing
sources
was
calculated
as
the
average
hap
emission
level
(
lb
hap
lb
solids
)
achieved
by
the
best
performing
12
percent
of
sources
,
that
is
,
those
sources
with
the
lowest
hap
emission
level
.
the
hap
emission
level
for
each
facility
was
calculated
by
dividing
the
facilitys
total
hap
usage
by
the
total
quantity
of
solids
in
the
finishing
materials
.
the
agency
had
collected
sufficient
data
on
the
hap
usage
at
major
sources
from
the
survey
of
the
industry
,
but
did
not
have
data
on
the
solids
content
of
each
finishing
material
used
by
a
facility
.
therefore
,
the
coating
supplier
for
each
major
source
calculated
the
emission
level
for
that
source
.
the
committee
agreed
that
data
provided
by
coating
suppliers
were
more
accurate
than
an
emission
level
calculated
using
only
the
epas
data
base
;
because
of
the
lack
of
data
on
the
solids
content
,
the
agency
would
have
needed
to
make
assumptions
to
calculate
the
emission
level
for
each
major
source
.
because
information
was
available
on
91
major
sources
,
the
mact
floor
was
calculated
as
the
average
emission
limitation
achieved
by
the
best
performing
11
existing
sources
(
ie
,
the
best
performing
12
percent
.
the
committee
agreed
that
the
11
sources
should
comprise
every
type
of
wood
furniture
operation
covered
by
the
proposed
rule
.
if
the
mact
floor
was
calculated
by
looking
only
at
the
emission
limit
of
the
top
11
sources
,
without
regard
to
industry
segment
,
one
industry
segment
could
be
`
overrepresented
over
represented
'
the
committee
was
especially
concerned
that
one
of
the
smaller
industry
segments
could
comprise
the
majority
of
sources
in
the
mact
floor
.
therefore
,
each
industry
segment
was
represented
in
the
mact
floor
proportional
to
its
representation
in
the
industry
.
the
committee
agreed
that
the
quantity
of
finishing
material
used
was
a
reasonable
method
for
assessing
the
percentage
of
the
entire
industry
represented
by
each
industry
segment
.
based
on
the
finishing
material
usage
data
collected
by
the
epa
through
its
survey
of
the
industry
,
it
was
determined
that
the
total
finishing
material
usage
by
the
source
category
was
approximately
distributed
as
follows
:
_
kitchen
cabinets
(
sic
2434
:
34
percent
_
residential
furniture
(
2511
:
44
percent
_
office
furniture
(
2521
:
7
percent
_
radio
tv
cabinets
(
2517
:
6
percent
_
upholstered
furniture
(
2512
:
35
percent
_
public
building
furniture
(
2531
:
3
percent
_
store
fixtures
(
2541
:
2
percent
_
other
(
2519
:
05
percent
based
on
the
above
distribution
,
the
committee
agreed
that
the
11
plants
comprising
the
mact
floor
should
include
the
best
performing
4
kitchen
cabinet
plants
(
34
percent
of
11
,
5
residential
furniture
plants
(
44
percent
,
1
office
furniture
plant
(
7
percent
,
and
1
plant
manufacturing
radio
tv
cabinets
(
6
percent
.
the
other
industry
segments
comprised
such
a
small
percentage
of
the
source
category
,
the
committee
believed
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
represent
them
in
the
mact
floor
analysis
.
the
committee
also
believed
that
the
industry
segments
not
included
in
the
mact
floor
were
similar
in
many
respects
to
those
that
were
included
and
would
therefore
be
able
to
achieve
the
same
mact
floor
emission
limit
.
