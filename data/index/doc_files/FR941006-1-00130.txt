the
act
anticipates
that
new
information
about
the
safety
or
effectiveness
of
marketed
drugs
may
require
changes
in
labeling
to
reflect
necessary
limitations
on
use
or
to
warn
of
previously
unanticipated
hazards
(
see
eg
,
21

fda
has
required
by
regulation
that
manufacturers
provide
warning
statements
for
specific
drug
products
(
eg
,
drugs
for
internal
use
which
contain
mineral

;
isoproterenol
inhalation
preparations
,

;
acetophenetidin
(
phenacetincontaining
preparations
,
21

.
the
impetus
for
requiring
warnings
for
each
of
these
products
or
product
classes
was
evidence
of
risk
in
a
specific
patient
population
or
from
a
specific
use
of
the
product
.
fda
responded
to
these
risks
by
requiring
warnings
to
help
patients
use
prescription
drug
products
more
safely
and
effectively
.
for
example
,
given
the
particular
risk
of
severe
paradoxical
bronchoconstriction
associated
with
repeated
,
excessive
use
of
isoproterenol
inhalation
preparations
,
fda
requires
that
warning
information
to
patients
be
included
as
part
of
the
label
and
as
part
of
the
instructions
included
in
the
package
dispensed
to
patients
(
see
21
cfr
201
305
.
the
specified
warning
statement
may
be
placed
on
the
immediate
container
with
a
statement
to
the
pharmacist
not
to
remove
it
or
may
be
included
in
a
package
with
instructions
to
pharmacists
to
place
the
warning
on
the
container
prior
to
dispensing

based
upon

authority
under
sections

,
502a
,
505
and
701a
)
of
the
act
,
the
agency
is
proposing
to
require
that
manufacturers
of
prescription
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
disclose
information
about
the
risks
presented
by
their
products
in
the
form
of
a
warning
statement
that
would
appear
on
such
products
in
the
manner
described
below
.
d
.
what
should
the
label
warning
be
required
to
state
?
fda
has
considered
what
information
should
be
required
in
the
warning
statement
to
ensure
that
,
as
required
by
sections
201n
,
403a1
,
502a
,
and
505
of
the
act
,
users
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
are
made
aware
of
the
potential
consequences
of
their
use
,
ie
,
that
the
labeling
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
states
the
facts
that
are
material
with
respect
to
the
consequences
that
may
result
from
the
use
of
these
products
.
the
proposed
warning
statements
in
the
ag
and
ndma
petitions
contained
the
various
information
elements
as
shown
in
table
9
.
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
to
fulfill
the
requirements
of
the
act
,
the
warning
statement
should
incorporate
some
elements
from
both
of
these
petitions
,
as
well
as
other
elements
that
are
designed
to
ensure
that
the
statement
performs
its
function
.
in
reaching
this
tentative
conclusion
,
fda
considered
several
factors
.
fda
agrees
with
the
ag
petition
that
the
term
`
warning
'
is
necessary
to
alert
the
user
to
the
potential
consequences
of
the
use
of
the
product
,
that
is
,
to
the
dangers
of
iron
overdose
.
this
term
is
universally
accepted
as
denoting
danger
.
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
the
potential
for
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
to
cause
death
or
serious
injury
any
time
a
small
child
gains
access
to
the
product
warrants
the
use
of
this
term
.
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
the
statement
must
bear
the
instruction
to
`
keep
away
from
children
'
because
a
child
is
at
risk
of
serious
injury
or
death
any
time
he
or
she
gains
access
to
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
,
this
statement
is
a
material
fact
about
the
consequences
of
use
of
the
product
and
is
also
necessary
to
ensure
the
safe
use
of
the
product
.
