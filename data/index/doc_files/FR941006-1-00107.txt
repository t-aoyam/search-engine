a
womans
recommended
daily
allowance
(

)
for
iron
during

doubles
from
15
to
30
mg

(

.
the
importance
of
prenatal
iron
supplementation
in
preventing
depletion
of
iron
stores
in
pregnant
women
has
been
shown
in
several
clinical
trials
(

.
thus
,
pregnant
women
are
often
counseled
to
increase
their
iron
intake
through
dietary
changes
and
the
use
of

iron
containing
supplements
or
drugs
.
a
committee
of
the
national
academy
of
sciences
(
nas
)
has
recommended
that
all
pregnant
women
should
be
screened
for
iron
deficiency
anemia
at
the
first
prenatal
visit
and
at
least
once
during
each
subsequent
trimester
(
ref
.

.
the
nas
committee
recommended
,
however
,
that
iron
supplementation
should
only
be
given
when
iron
status
is
low
or
marginal
,
as
indicated
by
hemoglobin
and
serum
ferritin
,
in
comparison
with
standard
values
recommended
by
nas
for
the
specific
trimester
of
pregnancy
.
when
these
clinical
indicators
reveal
deficient
iron
status
,
the
nas
committee
recommended
that
the
clinician
prescribe
60
to
120
mg
of
supplemental
iron
per
day
.
if
iron
status
is
marginal
,
the
nas
committee
recommended
that
the
clinician
prescribe
30
mg
of
supplemental
iron
per
day
.
if
iron
status
is
normal
,
the
nas
committee
recommended
that
these
be
no
iron

.
aside
from
the
iron
needs
that
arise
during
pregnancy
,
women
of
childbearing
child
bearing
age
have
a
higher
requirement
for
iron
than
other
adults
.
(
the
rda
for
women
of
childbearing
child
bearing
age
is
15
mg
day
because
of
the
depletion
of
iron
through
menstrual
blood
loss
.
it
is
10
mg
day
for
adult
males
and
older
adult
women
(
ref

)
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
dietary
intakes
high
enough
to
replace
those
losses
through
consumption
of
a
normal
diet
is
responsible
for
iron
deficiency
in
some
women
of
childbearing
child
bearing
age
.
for
these
women
also
,
the
use
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
may
be
prudent
.
iron
deficiency
also
affects
young
children
(
the
rda
for
iron
for
children
is
10
mg
day
,
particularly
during
the
rapid
growth
period
from
6
months
to
4
years
of
age
.
some
young
children
fail
to
develop
adequate
iron
stores
to
supply
the
iron
needed
for
their
metabolic
functions
during
this
early
growth
period
.
data
from
the
national
health
and
nutrition
examination
survey
(
nhanes
ii
)
for
children
show
that
the
prevalence
of
impaired
iron
status
ranges
from
an
estimated
3
to
12
percent
(
ref
.
2
.
thus
,
iron
supplementation
may
also
be
indicated
in
children
whose
iron
needs
are
not
met
through
dietary
intake
.
