construction

standards

osha
is
adopting
as
final
provisions
most
of
the
proposed
changes
to
the
1986
construction
standards
requirements
concerning
the
designation
of
a
`
competent
person
'
on
certain
construction
worksites
.
the
term
`
competent
person
'
is
derived
from
the
generic
construction
standards
provisions
.
under
these
,
employers
must
designate
a
`
competent
person
'
on
all
construction
worksites
to
conduct
`
frequent
and
regular
inspections
of
the
job
sites
,
materials
,
and
equipment
'
as
part
of
required
safety
and
health
programs
(
1926
20
.
at
the
suggestion
of
sesac
,
osha
has
designated
that
the
person
who
performs
the
shipyard
duties
analogous
to
the
competent
person
in
the
construction
standard
will
be
termed
a
`
qualified
person
'
for
the
purposes
of
the
present
discussion
these
terms
are
equivalent
and
will
be
discussed
as
`
competent
person
'
the
1986
asbestos
construction
standard
appeared
to
limit
this
requirement
.
`
competent
person
'
supervision
was
required
only
at
removal
,
demolition
,
and
renovation
operations
which
were
not
`
smallscale
small
scale
,
shortduration
short
duration
'
but
under
the
asbestos
standard
,
the
competent
person
was
to
be
specially
trained
in
asbestos
hazards
,
and
perform
various
duties
mainly
involving
the
setting
up
and
control
of
the
npe
,
and
the
supervision
of
workers
within
the
enclosure
(
formerly
1926
58
.
the
court
of
appeals
,
agreeing
with
bctd
,
instructed
osha
to
either
expand
the
`
competent
person
'
requirement
or
explain
more
persuasively
why
it
refused
to
do
so
.
osha
agrees
that
for
all
construction
work
involving
asbestos
exposure
under
this
standard
,
a
`
competent
person
'
who
is
specially
trained
in
asbestos
related
work
conditions
,
should
either
be
available
to
employees
or
be
present
on
the
work
site
.
like
other
provisions
in
this
standard
,
the
more
risky
asbestos
work
deserves
a
more
protective
provision
;
so
employees
performing
class
i
and
ii
work
will
have
the
benefit
of
a
`
competent
person
'
on
the
worksite
,
to
the
extent
necessary
to
perform
his
duties
as
set
out
in
paragraph
(
o
.
employees
performing
class
iii
and
iv
work
,
will
be
entitled
to
access
to
a
`
competent
person
'
as
needed
.
two
issues
regarding
the
`
competent
person
'
were
discussed
during
the
rulemaking
.
one
was
the
training
required
;
and
two
,
whether
or
not
the
competent
person
needs
to
be
present
throughout
the
operation
.
as
to
the
second
issue
,
the
standard
requires
in
paragraph
(
o
)
(
2
)
and
(
3
,
that
the
competent
person
must
perform
the
`
frequent
and
regular
inspections
of
the
job
sites
,
material
and
equipment
'
to
accomplish
`
health
and
safety
programs
'
which
are
otherwise
required
by
the
general
construction
provision
in
§
1926
20
.
although
no
elaboration
of
this
provision
is
provided
,
osha
intends
that
in
all
work
covered
by
this
standard
,
including
class
iv
work
and
work
not
included
in
a
`
class
'
a
competent
person
insures
,
by
inspecting
the
worksite
,
that
workers
exposed
to
asbestos
are
protected
by
the
relevant
provisions
of
this
standard
,
and
that
they
are
informed
pursuant
to
paragraph
(
k
)
of
this
standard
about
the
presence
and
location
of
acm
and
pacm
.
additionally
,
paragraph
(
o3
)
requires
that
in
class
i
operations
the
`
competent
person
'
must
make
onsite
on
site
inspections
at
least
once
during
the
workshift
and
any
time
at
employee
request
.
in
addition
,
the
list
of
specific
duties
of
the
`
competent
person
'
in
paragraph
(
o3i
)
for
class
i
and
ii
work
includes
specific
language
requiring
the
required
supervision
of
various
controls
and
work
practices
to
be
made
through
`
onsite
on
site
inspection
