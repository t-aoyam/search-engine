(

,
osha
believes
that
it
is
necessary
to
require
written
information
which
describes
daily
operation
and
management
of
the
facility
building
systems
which
directly
affects
iaq
.
when
it
comes
to
operations
and
management
,
organizational
fragmentation
within
nonindustrial
buildings
may
be
further
exacerbated
by
the
lack
of
familiarity
with
the
intent
of
the
original
design
team
whose
assumptions
and
design
intent
for
the
hvac
system
,
are
typically
unknown
.
over
time
,
building
use
may
differ
from
original
design
intent
in
ways
not
foreseen
by
the
original
designers
.
it
is
not
uncommon
for
spaces
to
be
loaded
or
used
in
ways
beyond
the
original
design
intent
which
may
adversely
impact
iaq
,
such
as
putting
up
walls
for
private
offices
,
exceeding
intended
occupant
densities
,
and
bringing
into
the
space
new
contaminant
sources
.
hvac
system
total
capacity
may
be
able
to
handle
these
changes
from
original
design
loads
but
little
is
done
to
balance
the
available
capacity
among
the
individual
zones
that
may
be
overused
or
underused
.
in
addition
,
the
employer
may
need
to
communicate
design
intent
and
performance
criteria
to
building
occupants
whose
expectations
regarding
their
environment
may
exceed
what
is
deliverable
by
the
building
systems
.
to
address
these
issues
,
osha
is
proposing
to
require
that
each
facility
have
written
operations
and
management
information
whose
aim
is
twofold
.
one
purpose
is
to
collect
,
summarize
and
translate
design
assumptions
and
intent
into
operating
performance
criteria
that
impact
iaq
,
such
as
minimum
outside
air
ventilation
rates
and
occupant
densities
.
secondly
,
the
operations
information
should
describe
how
to
operate
and
manage
the
building
systems
so
that
they
perform
in
conformance
with
the
reported
criteria
.
this
written
operations
and
management
information
replaces
verbal
communications
and
provides
a
training
document
whenever
new
personnel
or
new
contractors
are
introduced
to
the
site
.
operating
information
should
formally
reflect
changes
in
control
strategies
that
typically
occur
in
facilities
to
accommodate
change
in
use
or
energy
conservation
efforts
.
this
is
an
essential
element
because
of
the
interdependence
between
outside
air
ventilation
rate
and
the
automatic
temperature
control
system
.
in
almost
all
buildings
the
performance
of
the
ventilation
system
is
affected
by
space
temperature
control
needs
.
paragraph
(
c3v
)
proposes
to
require
a
written
maintenance
program
for
those
building
system
components
that
directly
affect
iaq
because
failure
to
do
so
may
result
in
the
degradation
of
iaq
in
the
facility
.
a
written
maintenance
program
is
believed
to
be
necessary
because
levels
of
hvac
system
maintenance
vary
dramatically
and
sometimes
are
deficient
where
untrained
personnel
are
designated
to
maintain
very
complex
systems
.
the
following
are
examples
of
maintenance
deficiencies
which
have
been
associated
with
iaq
problems
:
plugged
drains
on
cooling
coil
condensate
drip
pans
resulting
in
microbial
contamination
of
pan
;
failed
exhaust
fans
in
underground
parking
garages
which
allow
carbon
monoxide
to
infiltrate
into
the
building
above
;
microbial
fouling
of
cooling
tower
water
from
lack
of
water
treatment
with
biocides
resulting
in
legionellosis
cases
;
and
failure
of
automatic
temperature
control
system
resulting
in
lack
of
outside
ventilation
air
.
maintenance
of
hvac
equipment
,
for
example
,
may
include
simple
housekeeping
of
equipment
and
air
transport
pathways
,
lube
and
adjustment
programs
for
rotating
machinery
,
and
catastrophic
failure
maintenance
to
repair
replace
failed
equipment
.
there
appears
to
be
consensus
among
hvac
maintenance
personnel
that
the
most
successful
maintenance
programs
,
gauged
in
terms
of
system
performance
and
lifecycle
life
cycle
economics
,
are
proactive
rather
than
reactive
.
consequently
,
osha
is
promoting
preventive
maintenance
programs
for
those
building
system
components
which
affect
iaq
.
at
a
minimum
,
the
maintenance
program
should
describe
the
equipment
to
be
maintained
,
establish
maintenance
procedures
and
frequency
of
performance
.
paragraph
(
c3vi
)
proposes
to
require
a
checklist
to
guide
periodic
inspections
of
building
systems
.
this
checklist
should
focus
on
those
building
system
components
whose
failure
,
degradation
,
or
misuse
would
adversely
impact
indoor
air
quality
.
the
checklist
shall
include
but
not
be
limited
to
inspection
of
the
following
components
and
performance
criteria
:
fibrous
liner
used
for
acoustics
and
insulation
in
airhandlers
and
ducts
should
be
inspected
for
erosion
and
moisture
;
smoketrails
smoke
trails
testing
should
be
performed
to
verify
design
pressurization
schemes
like
negative
pressure
smoking
rooms
;
ceiling
,
floor
and
wall
surfaces
should
be
examined
for
signs
of
water
leaks
which
could
support
and
amplify
microbial
contamination
;
and
outside
air
louvers
,
intake
paths
,
dampers
,
actuators
,
and
linkages
should
be
checked
for
obstruction
.
