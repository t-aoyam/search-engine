crystals
which
have
different
crystal
regularity
in
two
or
three
main
directions
are
said
to
be
anisotropic
.
they
have
a
different
index
of
refraction
in
each
of
the
main
directions
.
when
such
a
crystal
is
inserted
between
the
crossed
polars
,
the
field
of
view
is
no
longer
dark
but
shows
the
crystal
in
color
.
the
color
depends
on
the
properties
of
the
crystal
.
the
light
acts
as
if
it
travels
through
the
crystal
along
the
optical
axes
.
if
a
crystal
optical
axis
were
lined
up
along
one
of
the
polarizing
directions
(
either
the
polarizer
or
the
analyzer
)
the
light
would
appear
to
travel
only
in
that
direction
,
and
it
would
blink
out
or
go
dark
.
the
difference
in
degrees
between
the
fiber
direction
and
the
angle
at
which
it
blinks
out
is
called
the
angle
of
extinction
.
when
this
angle
can
be
measured
,
it
is
useful
in
identifying
the
mineral
.
the
procedure
for
measuring
the
angle
of
extinction
is
to
first
identify
the
polarization
direction
in
the
microscope
.
a
commercial
alignment
slide
can
be
used
to
establish
the
polarization
directions
or
use
anthophyllite
or
another
suitable
mineral
.
this
mineral
has
a
zero
degree
angle
of
extinction
and
will
go
dark
to
extinction
as
it
aligns
with
the
polarization
directions
.
when
a
fiber
of
anthophyllite
has
gone
to
extinction
,
align
the
eyepiece
reticle
or
graticule
with
the
fiber
so
that
there
is
a
visual
cue
as
to
the
direction
of
polarization
in
the
field
of
view
.
tape
or
otherwise
secure
the
eyepiece
in
this
position
so
it
will
not
shift
.
after
the
polarization
direction
has
been
identified
in
the
field
of
view
,
move
the
particle
of
interest
to
the
center
of
the
field
of
view
and
align
it
with
the
polarization
direction
.
for
fibers
,
align
the
fiber
along
this
direction
.
note
the
angular
reading
of
the
rotating
stage
.
looking
at
the
particle
,
rotate
the
stage
until
the
fiber
goes
dark
or
`
blinks
out
.
again
note
the
reading
of
the
stage
.
the
difference
in
the
first
reading
and
the
second
is
an
angle
of
extinction
.
the
angle
measured
may
vary
as
the
orientation
of
the
fiber
changes
about
its
long
axis
.
tables
of
mineralogical
data
usually
report
the
maximum
angle
of
extinction
.
asbestos
forming
minerals
,
when
they
exhibit
an
angle
of
extinction
,
usually
do
show
an
angle
of
extinction
close
to
the
reported
maximum
,
or
as
appropriate
depending
on
the
substitution

crossed

with

when
the
optical
axes
of
a

are
not

along
one
of
the

directions
(
either
the
polarizer

)
part
of
the
light
travels
along
one
axis
and
part
travels
along
the
other
visible
axis
.
this
is
characteristic
of
birefringent
materials
.
the
color
depends
on
the
difference
of
the
two
visible
indices
of
refraction
and
the
thickness
of
the
crystal
.
the
maximum
difference
available
is
the
difference
between
the
and
the
axes
.
this
maximum
difference
is
usually
tabulated
as
the
birefringence
of
the
crystal
.
for
this
test
,
align
the
fiber
at
45
&
cir
;
to
the
polarization
directions
in
order
to
maximize
the
contribution
to
each
of
the
optical
axes
.
the
colors
seen
are
called
retardation
colors
.
they
arise
from
the
recombination
of
light
which
has
traveled
through
the
two
separate
directions
of
the
crystal
.
one
of
the
rays
is
retarded
behind
the
other
since
the
light
in
that
direction
travels
slower
.
on
recombination
,
some
of
the
colors
which
make
up
white
light
are
enhanced
by
constructive
interference
and
some
are
suppressed
by
destructive
interference
.
the
result
is
a
color
dependent
on
the
difference
between
the
indices
and
the
thickness
of
the
crystal
.
the
proper

and

examination
of
the
equation
for
asbestos
minerals
reveals
that
the
visible
colors
for
almost
all
common
asbestos
minerals
and
fiber
sizes
are
shades
of
gray
and
black
.
the
eye
is
relatively
poor
at
discriminating
different
shades
of
gray
.
it
is
very
good
at
discriminating
different
colors
.
in
order
to
compensate
for
the
low
retardation
,
a
compensator
is
added
to
the
light
train
between
the
polarization
elements
.
the
compensator
used
for
this
test
is
a
gypsum
plate
of
known
thickness
and
birefringence
.
such
a
compensator
when
oriented
at
45
&
cir
;
to
the
polarizer
direction
,
provides
a
retardation
of
530
nm
of
the
530
nm
wavelength
color
.
this
enhances
the
red
color
and
gives
the
background
a
characteristic
red
to
redmagenta
red
magenta
color
.
if
this
`
fullwave

'
compensator
is
in
place
when
the
asbestos
preparation
is
inserted
into
the
light
train
,
the
colors
seen
on
the
fibers
are
quite
different
.
gypsum
,
like
asbestos
has
a
fast
axis
and
a
slow
axis
.
when
a
fiber
is
aligned
with
its
fast
axis
in
the
same
direction
as
the
fast
axis
of
the
gypsum
plate
,
the
ray
vibrating
in
the
slow
direction
is
retarded
by
both
the
asbestos
and
the
gypsum
.
this
results
in
a
higher
retardation
than
would
be
present
for
either
of
the
two
minerals
.
the
color
seen
is
a
second
order
blue
.
when
the
fiber
is
rotated
90
&
cir
;
using
the
rotating
stage
,
the
slow
direction
of
the
fiber
is
now
aligned
with
the
fast
direction
of
the
gypsum
and
the
fast
direction
of
the
fiber
is
aligned
with
the
slow
direction
of
the
gypsum
.
thus
,
one
ray
vibrates
faster
in
the
fast
direction
of
the
gypsum
,
and
slower
in
the
slow
direction
of
the
fiber
;
the
other
ray
will
vibrate
slower
in
the
slow
direction
of
the
gypsum
and
faster
in
the
fast
direction
of
the
fiber
.
in
this
case
,
the
effect
is
subtractive
and
the
color
seen
is
a
first
order
yellow
.
as
long
as
the
fiber
thickness
does
not
add
appreciably
to
the
color
,
the
same
basic
colors
will
be
seen
for
all
asbestos
types
except
crocidolite
.
in
crocidolite
the
colors
will
be
weaker
,
may
be
in
the
opposite
directions
,
and
will
be
altered
by
the
blue
absorption
color
natural
to
crocidolite
.
hundreds
of
other
materials
will
give
the
same
colors
as
asbestos
,
and
therefore
,
this
test
is
not
definitive
for
asbestos
.
the
test
is
useful
in
discriminating
against
fiberglass
or
other
amorphous
fibers
such
as
some
synthetic
fibers
.
certain
synthetic
fibers
will
show
retardation
colors
different
than
asbestos
;
however
,
there
are
some
forms
of
polyethylene
and
aramid
which
will
show
morphology
and
retardation
colors
similar
to
asbestos
minerals
.
this
test
must
be
supplemented
with
a
positive
identification
test
when
birefringent
fibers
are
present
which
can
not
be
excluded
by
morphology
.
this
test
is
relatively
ineffective
for
use
on
fibers
less
than
1
&
mum
in
diameter
.
for
positive
confirmation
tem
or
sem
should
be
used
if
no
larger
bundles
or
fibers
are
visible
