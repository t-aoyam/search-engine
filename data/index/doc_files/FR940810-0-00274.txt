the
advantages
of

microcopy
are
:
(
a
)
basic
identification
of
the
materials
was
first
performed
by
light
microscopy
and
gross
analysis
.
this
provides
a
large

of
published
information
against
which
to
check

the
analysis
is
specific
to
fibers

the
minerals
present
can
exist
in
asbestiform
,
fibrous
,
prismatic
,
or
massive
varieties
all
at
the

time

therefore
,
bulk
methods
of

are
inappropriate
where
the
material
is
not
known
to
be
fibrous

(

the
analysis
is
quick
,
requires
little
preparation

,
and
can
be
performed
onsite
on

if
a
suitably

available

the
disadvantages
are
:
(
a
)
even
using

phase
polar
illumination
,
not
all
the
fibers

may
be

.
this
is
a
problem
for
very
low
asbestos
concentrations
where
agglomerations
or
large
bundles
of
fibers
may
not
be
present
to
allow
identification
by
inference
.
(
b
)
the
method
requires
a
great
degree
of
sophistication
on
the
part
of
the
microscopist

is
only
as
useful
as

it

(

the

this

interferences
any
material
which
is
long
,
thin
,
and
small
enough
to
be
viewed
under
the
microscope
can
be
considered
an
interference
for
asbestos
.
there
are
literally
hundreds
of
interferences
in
workplaces
.
the
techniques
described
in
this

are
normally
sufficient
to
eliminate
the
interferences

an
analysts
success
in
eliminating
the
interferences
depends

training
.
asbestos
minerals
belong
to
two
mineral
families
:
the
serpentines
and
the
amphiboles
.
in
the
serpentine
family
,
the
only
common
fibrous
mineral
is
chrysotile
.
occasionally
,
the
mineral
antigorite
occurs
in
a
fibril
habit
with
morphology
similar
to
the
amphiboles
.
the
amphibole
minerals
consist
of
a
score
of
different
minerals
of
which
only
five
are
regulated
by
federal
standard
:
amosite
,
crocidolite
,
anthophyllite
asbestos
,
tremolite
asbestos
and
actinolite
asbestos
.
these
are
the
only
amphibole
minerals
that
have
been
commercially
exploited
for
their
fibrous
properties
;
however
,
the
rest
can
and
do
occur
occasionally
in
asbestiform
habit
.
in
addition
to
the
related
mineral
interferences
,
other
minerals
common
in
building
material
may
present
a
problem
for
some
microscopists
:
gypsum
,
anhydrite
,
brucite
,
quartz
fibers
,
talc
fibers
or
ribbons
,
wollastonite
,
perlite
,
attapulgite

are

embedding
material
can
sometimes
be
a

.
the
analyst
may
not
be
able
to
easily
extract
the
fibers
from
the
matrix
in
order
to
use
the
method
.
where
possible
,
remove
the
matrix
before
the
analysis
,
taking
careful
note
of
the
loss
of

.
some
common
matrix
materials
are
:
vinyl
,
rubber
,
tar
,
paint
,
plant
fiber
,
cement
,
and
epoxy
.
a
further
negative
interference
is
that
the
asbestos
fibers
themselves
may
be
either
too
small
to
be
seen
in
phase
contrast
microscopy
(
pcm
)
or
of
a
very
low

uses
and
occupational
exposure
asbestos
is
ubiquitous
in
the
environment
.
more
than
40
%
of
the
land
area
of
the
united
states
is
composed
of
minerals
which
may
contain
asbestos
.
fortunately
,
the
actual
formation
of
great
amounts
of
asbestos
is
relatively
rare
.
nonetheless
,
there
are
locations
in
which
environmental
exposure
can
be
severe
such
as
in
the
serpentine
hills
of
california
.
there
are
thousands
of
uses
for
asbestos
in
industry
and
the
home
.
asbestos
abatement
workers
are
the
most
current
segment
of
the
population
to
have
occupational
exposure
to
great
amounts
of
asbestos
.
if
the
material
is
undisturbed
,
there
is
no
exposure
.
exposure
occurs
when
the
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
material
is
abraded
or
otherwise
disturbed
during
maintenance
operations
or
some
other
activity
.
approximately
95
%
of
the
asbestos
in
place
in
the
united
states
is
chrysotile
.
amosite
and
crocidolite
make
up
nearly
all
the
difference
.
tremolite
and
anthophyllite
make
up
a
very
small
percentage
.
tremolite
is
found
in
extremely
small
amounts
in
certain
chrysotile
deposits
.
actinolite
exposure
is
probably
greatest
from
environmental
sources
,
but
has
been
identified
in
vermiculite
containing
,
sprayedon

on
insulating
materials
