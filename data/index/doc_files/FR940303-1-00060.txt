has
carefully
considered
whether
there

for

derived
from

.
fsis
believes
that
such
action
is
not
necessary
because
protein
and
fat
are
nutrients
whose
declaration
becomes
mandatory
on
the
labeling
of
most
multiingredient
ingredient
meat
and
poultry
products
upon
the
effective
date
of
the
nutrition
labeling
regulations
which
is
07/06/1994
(

fr

.
these
regulations
also
establish
a
voluntary
nutrition
labeling
program
for
singleingredient
single

,
raw
products
,
and
specify
that
fsis
will
evaluate
significant
participation
of
the
voluntary
program
.
if
significant
participation
is
not
found
,
fsis
shall
initiate
rulemaking
to
require
nutrition
labeling
on
those
products
under
the
voluntary
program
.
therefore
,
with
certain
exceptions
,
consumers
will
have
complete
information
about
the
two
nutrients
in
muscle
meat
that
are
the
sole
source
of
calories
and
are
characteristic
of
the
nutrient
profile
of
meat
.
such
information
will
ensure
that
consumers
are
not
misled
about
the
composition
of
products
containing
meat
obtained
using
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
.
fsis
recognizes
that
not
all
products
sold
to
consumers
at
the
retail
level
will
carry
nutrition

.
fsiss
final
regulation
on
nutrition

provided
for
certain
exceptions

including
products
produced
by
small
businesses
and
products
in
individually
wrapped
packages
of
less
than
1/2
ounce
net
weight
,
provided
that
the
labels
for
these
products
bear
no
nutrition
claims
or
nutrition
information
.
however
,
labeling
will
be
required
on
most
processed
products
purchased
by
consumers
in
retail
stores
so
that
,
together
with
the
voluntary

for

information
on
singleingredient
single

,
raw

,
consumers
will
have
information
on
protein
and

for
most
products
purchased
for
consumption
at
home
.
furthermore
,
fsis
believes
that
the
fat
and
protein
contents
of
meat
derived
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
recovery
systems
would
be
comparable
to
the
fat
and
protein
contents
of
meat
derived
from
handdeboning
hand
deboning
.
based
on
these
considerations
,
fsis
maintains
that
there
is
no
need
to
establish
minimum

and
or
maximum

contents
for
products
derived
from

fsis
is
proposing
to
include
in

of

'
criteria
on
maximum
calcium
content
(
as
a
measure
of
bone

)
of
this
meat
to
assure
that
the
meat
derived
from

and

is
both
consistent
with
consumer
expectations
of
`

and
comparable
to

as
traditionally

the
criteria
is
a
measure
designed
to
ensure
that

not
crushed

ground
,
or

the
maximum
calcium

of

of

is
supported
by
data

furthermore
,
based
upon
analytical
repeatability
studies
conducted
by
the
agency
for

,
fsis
proposes
to
establish
a
tolerance

of
0

protein

is
a
measure
of
the

and
availability
of

in

a

.
when
the

published
in
1982
(

,
one
of
the
methods
specified
for
measuring
protein
quality
was
the
protein

the
per

measures
the
ability
of
a

source
to
support

in

,
and
is
an
expensive
and
timeconsuming

fsis
adopted
a
newer
method
for
measuring
protein
quality
,
in
order
to
assure
the
value
of
the
protein
contributed
by
meat
and
poultry
to
human
dietary
needs
,
in

the

the

,
therefore
,
is
more
