reported
on
symptoms
associated
with
new
carpeting
in
a

twenty
out

35

air
sampling
was
conducted
before
and
after
carpet
removal
;
a
similar
range
of
aliphatic
hydrocarbons
was
found
after
removal
,
but
in
much
lower
concentrations
.
many
individuals
who
believe
the
building
they
work
in
is
implicated
in
sbs
,
have
described
similar
effects
.
symptoms
usually
include
one
or
more
of
the
following
:
mucous
membrane
(
eye
,
nose
,
or
throat
)
irritation
,
dry
skin
,
headache
,
nausea
,
fatigue
,
and
lethargy
[

.
these
symptoms
are
generally
believed
to
result
from
indoor
air
pollution
.
there
is
no
secondary
spread
of
symptoms
to
others
outside
the
building
who
are
exposed
to
the
occupants
(
unlike
the
situation
faced
by
many
chemical
and
asbestos
workers

anderson

suggested
the
possible
causes
for
sbs
as
related
to
psychosocial
,
chemical
,
physical
,
or
biological
factors
.
anderson
[

distinguished
sbs
symptoms
as
different
from
mass
psychogenic
illness
;
although
in
general
the
causes
of
sbs
are
unknown
,
he
suggested
that
most
sbs
symptoms
could
be
explained
by
stimulation
of
sensory
nerve
fibers
in
the
upper
airways
and
the
face
(
referred
to
as
common
chemical
sense
.
because
these
fibers
can
respond
in
only
one
way
,
sbs
cases
largely
have
the
same
symptoms
irrespective
of
the
cause
[

.
it
is
now
known
that
there
is
a
variety
of
important
health
effects
from
indoor
air
pollution
.
in
addition
to
the
indoor
environmental
disease
caused
by
infectious
agents
,
carcinogens
or
toxins
;
the
indoor
environment
may
create
conditions
that
can
produce
skin
and
mucosal
allergy
and
hyperactivity
reactions
,
sensory
effects
(
odors
and
irritations
,
airways
effects
(
from
both
acute
and
chronic
exposures
,
neuropsychological
effects
,
and
psychosocial
effects
,
especially
due
to
the
lack
of
social
support
[

.
indoor
air
pollution
may
be
caused
by
physical
,
chemical
,
or
microbiological
agents
,
and
is
aggravated
by
poor
ventilation
.
the
causation
of
sbs
by
indoor
air
pollution
was
first
objectively
demonstrated
in
1984
in
a
study
of
62
danish
subjects
suffering
from
`
indoor
climate
symptoms
'
[
ex
.
420
.
these
subjects
reported
primarily
eye
and
upper
respiratory
irritation
,
but
were
otherwise
healthy
individuals
,
and
did
not
suffer
from
asthma
,
allergy
,
or
bronchitis
.
the
subjects
were
exposed
to
a
mixture
of
22
volatile
organic
chemicals
commonly
found
in
the
indoor
environment
at
concentrations
of
0
,
5
,
and
25
mg
m
.
.
these
concentrations
corresponded
respectively
to
`
clean
'
air
,
average
polluted
air
in
danish
houses
,
and
maximum
polluted
air
in
danish
houses
.
after
exposure
,
the
digit
span
test
was
administered
.
the
digit
span
test
consists
of
the
subject
being
allowed
to
view
a
series
of
random
digits
for
a
short
period
of
time
;
the
numbers
are
then
covered
up
and
the
subject
asked
to
repeat
the
sequence
backwards
.
this
test
is
reported
to
be
sensitive
to
situational
anxiety
and
alertness
,
and
therefore
a
measure
of
stress
and
ability
to
concentrate
.
bach

found
significant
declines
in
performance
on
the
digit
span
test
following
exposure
to
these
low
levels
of
volatile
organic
chemicals
,
demonstrating
objectively
the
existence
of
sbs
[

.
molhave
et
al
.
[
ex
.
4228
,
in
reporting
on
the
same
62
subjects
,
found
that
subjects
exposed
for
23/4
hrs
did
not
adapt
,
and
that
the
subjects
reacted
to
irritation
of
the
mucous
membranes
and
not
to
odor
intensity
.
the
exposure
was
doubledblind
doubled
blind
,
and
neither
the
subjects
nor
the
testers
knew
the
exposure
.
although
these
problems
have
been
demonstrated
to
be
real
,
they
may
affect
only
a
small
percentage
of
building
occupants
.
also
,
there
are
various
degrees
of
problems
which
may
occur
.
some
individuals
who
experience
relatively
mild
and
treatable
symptoms
such
as
headache
,
may
be
able
to
cope
with
the
sick
building
environment
for
extended
periods
,
although
suffering
from
increased
stress
.
other
individuals
,
more
seriously
affected
,
may
find
symptoms
so
severe
that
they
may
be
unable
to
be
in
the
building
for
extended
periods
,
or
at
all
.
still
others
may
become
temporarily
or
permanently
disabled
.
it
has
been
suggested
that
sbs
may
not
be
one
syndrome
but
a
number
of
subsyndromes
sub
syndromes
[
ex
.
4170
.
this
hypothesis
suggests
that
the
symptoms
particularly
associated
with
chemical
exposure
include
fatigue
;
headache
;
dry
and
irritated
eyes
,
nose
,
and
throat
;
and
sometimes
include
nausea
and
dizziness
.
those
symptoms
most
related
to
microbial
exposures
would
result
in
itchy
,
congested
,
or
runny
nose
;
itchy
watery
eyes
;
and
sometimes
include
wheezing
,
tight
chest
,
or
flulike
flu
like
symptoms
.
the
overlapping
symptoms
in
each
case
are
eye
,
nose
,
and
throat
irritation
,
perhaps
making
the
two
subsyndromes
sub
syndromes
,
chemical
and
microbial
,
difficult
to
distinguish
.
jones
concludes
that
there
is
a
need
for
a
treatment
protocol
as
well
as
a
diagnostic
protocol
,
which
,
in
addition
to
describing
corrective
actions
available
in
response
to
different
diagnostic
findings
,
would
also
provide
guidelines
for
the
design
and
implementation
of
followup
follow
studies
of
buildings
and
individuals
in
order
to
assess
treatment
effectiveness

one
episode
that

in
a
building
occupied
by
a
government
agency

as
a
result

problems
related
to
carpeting

other
suspected
causes
,
five

they
had
