disciplinary
authorities
in
all
50
states
and
in
the
district
of
columbia
have
adopted
one
of
these
rules
,
or
a
similar
prohibition
.
underlying
these
rules
is
the
recognition
that
when
two
parties
in
a
legal
proceeding
are
represented
,
it
is
unfair
for
an
attorney
to
circumvent
opposing
counsel
and
employ
superior
skills
and
legal
training
to
take
advantage
of
the
opposing
party
.
at
the
same
time
,
the
courts
have
long
recognized
that
government
law
enforcement
agents
must
be
allowed
broad
powers
,
within
constitutional
limits
,
to
investigate
crime
and
civil
violations
of
police
and
regulatory
laws
.
these
powers
properly
include
the
authority
to
conduct
undercover
operations
and
to
interview
witnesses
,
potential
suspects
,
targets
and
even
defendants
who
waive
their
rights
to
remain
silent
.
although
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
significantly
restrict
contacts
with
defendants
after
their
initial
appearance
before
a
judge
or
after
indictment
,
these
constraints
generally
do
not
apply
before
a
person
has
been
taken
into
custody
or
charged
in
an
adversary
proceeding
.
sound
policies
support
this
substantial
power
of
police
to
investigate
.
the
general
public
,
victims
of
crime
,
and
even
potential
suspects
have
a
strong
interest
in
vigorous
inquiry
by
law
enforcement
officers
before
arrest
or
the
filing
of
charges
.
as
long
as
investigations
were
treated
as
within
the
province
of
the
police
alone
,
the
traditional
rule
forbidding
counsel
from
directly
contacting
represented
persons
did
not
come
into
conflict
with
legitimate
law
enforcement
activities
.
in
recent
years
,
however
,
the
department
of
justice
has
encouraged
federal
prosecutors
to
play
a
larger
role
in
preindictment
,
prearrest
investigations
.
some
of
this
increased
involvement
stems
from
the
wider
use
of
law
enforcement
techniques
,
such
as
electronic
surveillance
,
which
require
the
preparation
of
legal
filings
.
also
,
complex
white
collar
and
organized
crime
investigations
necessitate
more
intensive
engagement
of
lawyers
,
who
present
such
cases
to
grand
juries
.
most
important
,
greater
participation
of
lawyers
at
the
preindictment
stage
of
law
enforcement
has
been
regarded
as
helpful
in
assuring
that
police
investigations
comply
with
high
legal
and
ethical
standards
.
this
extension
of
the
traditional
prosecutors
responsibility
has
been
a
salutary
development
.
one
byproduct
by
product
,
however
,
has
been
uncertainty
about
whether
the
traditional
professional
limitation
on
attorney
contacts
with
represented
parties
should
be
viewed
as
a
restriction
upon
prosecutors
engaged
in
investigations
and
,
by
extension
,
the
agents
with
whom
they
work
.
the
overwhelming
preponderance
of
federal
appellate
courts
have
held
that
the
restriction
on
contacts
with
represented
persons
does
not
apply
at
the
preindictment
investigation
stage
.

in
recent
years
,
state
courts
and
state
bar
organizations
have
expressed
different
views
on
the
point
at
which
the
prohibition
on
contacts
now
embodied
in
dr
7104
,
model
rule
42
and
their
analogs
should
apply
to
criminal
enforcement
proceedings
.
uncertainty
about
the
scope
and
applicability
of
dr
7104
,
rule
42
and
their
state
counterparts
has
directly
affected
the
investigative
activities
of
agents
,
including
federal
bureau
of
investigation
and
drug
enforcement
administration
personnel
,
who
work
with
prosecutors
.
an
expansive
application
of
these
rules
in
some
jurisdictions
may
have
the
effect
of
blocking
preindictment
interviews
or
undercover
operations
that
most
courts
have
held
permissible
under
federal
constitutional
and
statutory
law
.
this
problem
is
compounded
when
federal
attorneys
assigned
to
the
same
case
are
members
of
different
state
bars
.
under
federal
law
,
a
department
attorney
must
be
a
member
in
good
standing
of
a
state
bar
,
but
he
or
she
need
not
belong
to
the
bar
in
each
state
in
which
he
or
she
is
practicing
for
the
government
.
as
a
result
,
prosecution
teams
often
comprise
attorneys
admitted
to
different
bars
.
the
application
of
different
state
disciplinary
rules
to
these
individuals
creates
uncertainty
,
confusion
and
the
possibility
of
unfairness
.
indeed
,
one
member
of
a
twomember
two
member
federal
prosecution
team
could
receive
a
commendation
for
effective
law
enforcement
while
the
other
member
would
be
subject
to
state
discipline
for
the
exact
same
conduct
.
in
light
of
these
circumstances
,
the
department
has
concluded
that
a
compelling
need
exists
which
warrants
a
uniform
federal
rule
to
reconcile
the
traditional
rule
against
contacts
with
a
represented
person
with
the
obligation
of
the
department
of
justice
to
enforce
the
law
vigorously
.
indeed
,
absent
a
new
federal
rule
,
prosecutors
have
been
forced
on
occasion
to
reduce
their
participation
in
the
investigative
phase
of
law
enforcement
so
as
to
leave
federal
agents
unfettered
by
state
disciplinary
rules
that
were
never
intended
to
govern
police
behavior
.
such
a
retreat
from
the
field
by
prosecutors
serves
neither
efficiency
nor
the
interest
in
elevating
legal
compliance
and
ethical
standards
in
all
phases
of
law
enforcement
.
furthermore
,
the
disciplinary
rules
themselves
invite
this
type
of
regulation
.
virtually
all
the
states
have
adopted
rules
that
include
an
`
authorized
by
law
'
exception
.
these
proposed
regulations
are
intended
to
provide
legal
authorization
in
states
whose
bar
rules
provide
that
exception
.
finally
,
the
department
has
long
maintained
,
and
continues
to
maintain
,
that
it
has
the
authority
to
exempt
its
attorneys
from
the
application
of
dr
7104
and
model
rule
42
and
their
state
counterparts
.
furthermore
,
the
department
maintains
that
whether
,
and
to
what
extent
,
such
prohibitions
should
apply
to
department
attorneys
is
a
policy
question
.

however
,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
all
50
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
have
adopted
some
form
of
a
prohibition
on
contacts
with
represented
parties
,
and
in
view
of
the
long
history
of
those
rules
,
the
department
believes
that
its
attorneys
should
adhere
to
the
principles
underlying
those
rules
to
the
maximum
extent
possible
.
therefore
,
even
though
the
department
has
the
authority
to
exempt
its
attorneys
from
the
reach
of
these
rules
,
the
department
has
decided
not
to
implement
a
wholesale
exemption
.
