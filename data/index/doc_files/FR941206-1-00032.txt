these
employers
.
these
plans
are
to
be
designed
to
convincingly

an
increase
in
the
average
passenger
occupancy
(
apo
)
of
their
employees
who
commute
to
work
during
the
peak
period
of
no
less
than
25
percent
above
the
average
vehicle
occupancy
(
avo
)
of
the
nonattainment
area
.
avo
is
defined
as
the
number
of
employees
reporting
to
all
worksites
in
the
program
area
from
6
am

to
10

divided
by
the
number
of
vehicles
driven
by
these
employees
during

background
the
clean
air
act
as
amended
in
1990
requires
employers
with
100
or
more
employees
in
severe
and
extreme
ozone
nonattainment
areas
to
participate
in
a
trip
reduction
program
.
this
includes
18
of
the
21
counties
in
new
jersey
,
excluding
the
counties
of
warren
,
atlantic
,
and
cape
may
.
epa
issued
guidance
on
12/17/1992
interpreting
various
aspects
of
the
statutory
requirements
(
employee
commute
options
guidance
,
12/19/1992
.
although
the
federal
program
has
been
named
`
employee
commute
options
'
or
`
eco
,
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
opted
for
the
name
`
employer
trip
reduction
'
or
`
etr
.
the
program
shall
be
referred
to
as
`
etr
'
for
the
remainder
of
this
document
.
the
concern
that
led
to
the
inclusion
of
the
etr
provision
in
the
amended
clean
air
act
is
that
people
are
driving
more
than
ever
before
.
in
addition
,
the
distances
driven
per
trip
have
increased
considerably
.
this
has
resulted
in
a
rapid
increase
in
the
number
of
vehicle
miles
traveled
(
vmt
)
and
has
offset
a
large
part
of
the
emissions
reductions
achieved
through
the
production
and
sale
of
vehicles
that
operate
more
cleanly
.
it
is
widely
accepted
that
within
a
decade
,
the
increased
emissions
caused
by
increased
vmt
and
congestion
will
outweigh
the
benefits
derived
from
new
less
polluting
vehicles
.
unless
this
increase
in
vmt
is
mitigated
,
there
will
be
an
overall
increase
in
emissions
from
motor
vehicles
.
the
etr
provision
is
designed
to
decrease
the
use
of
single
occupancy
vehicles
and
to
reduce
emissionsbeyond
what
can
be
and
will
be
obtained
via
stricter
tailpipe
and
fuel
standards
.
section
182d1b
)
of
the
amended
clean
air
act
requires
that
employers
submit
their
compliance
plans
to
a
state
within
two
years
of
the
date
the
state
submits
its
trip
reduction
plan
to
epa
.
the
compliance
plans
should
be
designed
to
`
convincingly
demonstrate
'
an
increase
in
the
apo
for
their
employees
who
commute
to
work
during
the
peak
period
by
no
less
than
25
percent
above
the
avo
of
the
area
.
new
jersey
has
established
different
zones
within
its
nonattainment
areas
for
the
purpose
of
calculating
the
avo
.
the
compliance
plans
must
`
convincingly
demonstrate
'
that
the
employers
will
meet
the
target
within
two
years
of
submitting
a
compliance
plan
,
or
by
11/15/1996
for
new
jersey
.
in
order
to
gain
approval
,
a
states
submittal
must
contain
each
of
the
following
program
elements
:
(
1
)
the
avo
for
each
zone
if
the
area
is
divided
into
zones
;
(
2
)
the
target
apos
)
which
isare
)
no
less
than
25
percent
above
the
avos
;
(
3
)
an
etr
program
that
includes
a
process
for
compliance
demonstration
;
and
(
4
)
enforcement
procedures
to
ensure
submission
and
implementation
of
compliance
plans
by
employers
.
the
acceptability
of
these
elements
as
submitted
by
new
jersey
is
discussed
below
.
