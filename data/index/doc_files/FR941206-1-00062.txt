is
based

the

to
be

subcategorization

section

)
of
the
clean
air
act
gives
the
environmental
protection
agency
the
authority
to
distinguish
among
classes
,
types
,
and
sizes
of
sources
within
a
source
category
in
establishing
standards
.
there
are
many
reasons
for
subcategorizing
a
source
category
.
a
primary
reason
for
subcategorizing
a
source
category
is
that
different
types
of
control
techniques
may
be
appropriate
depending
on
the
type
of
product
manufactured
,
the
manufacturing
process
,
and
the
size
of
the
plant
.
due
to
the
diversity
of
this
source
category
,
the
committee
considered
subcategorizing
the
source
category
by
industry
market
segment
(
eg
,
kitchen
cabinet
manufacturers
,
residential
furniture
,
upholstered
furniture
,
etc
)
and
by
manufacturing
process
(
eg
,
finishing
a
piece
before
it
is
assembled
,
finishing
a
piece
after
assembly
.
discussions
of
subcategorization
occurred
through
several
regulatory
negotiation
meetings
.
a
recurring
issue
during
the
discussions
was
the
difficulty
in
assigning
a
facility
to
one
subcategory
.
some
wood
furniture
facilities
manufacture
products
for
different
market
segments
and
some
use
multiple
manufacturing
processes
.
as
the
data
were
evaluated
and
the
recommended
format
of
the
standards
was
developed
,
it
became
apparent
that
the
proposed
standards
were
most
likely
going
to
be
a
limit
on
the
pounds
of
hap
emitted
per
pound
of
solids
used
at
a
source
(
see
section
vid
.
the
committees
review
of
the
data
revealed
that
the
hap
limit
of
facilities
in
the
source
category
did
not
vary
significantly
according
to
the
industry
market
segment
,
the
size
of
the
facility
,
or
the
manufacturing
process
.
in
addition
,
subcategorization
by
market
segment
could
not
address
the
diversity
of
the
industry
as
there
was
as
much
variation
in
the
types
of
control
techniques
used
within
each
market
segment
as
between
the
market
segments
.
another
aspect
that
the
committee
discussed
was
the
potential
for
subcategorization
to
limit
the
flexibility
of
sources
in
complying
with
the
standards
.
one
compliance
method
under
consideration
(
and
ultimately
included
in
the
proposal
)
was
one
that
allowed
averaging
across
various
finishing
steps
within
a
facility
.
in
this
industry
,
however
,
the
finishing
steps
could
be
within
different
subcategories
and
the
epa
interprets
the
act
as
not
allowing
averaging
across
subcategories
for
compliance
determinations
.
this
made
subcategorization
less
attractive
to
the
committee
.
the
committee
decided
that
the
disadvantages
of
subcategorizing
this
industry
outweighed
any
benefits
to
either
the
affected
sources
or
to
regulators
.
instead
,
the
committee
worked
to
allow
multiple
compliance
techniques
that
could
address
the
operational
differences
among
the
various
segments
within
the
source
category
.
