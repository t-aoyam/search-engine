problems
in

if

related

older
buildings
that
have
not
been
adequately
maintained
and
operated
may
have
problems
with
bioaerosols
if
parts
of
the

have
been
allowed

become
reservoirs
for

also
,
if
inadequate
outside
air
is
provided
,
regardless
of
the
age
of
the
building
,
chemical
and
biological
contaminants
will
build
up
to
levels
that
can
cause
health
effects
in
some
workers
.
in

other
physical
factors
such
as
lack
of

,

,
and
inadequate
lighting
,
and
ergonomic
factors
involving
uncomfortable

intensive

will

in

some
information
contained
in
the
docket
indicates
that
these
chronic
health
complaints
are
psychological
,
however
,
osha
believes
that
chronic
health
complaints
related
to
poor
indoor
air
quality
are
unlikely
to
be
due
to
mass
psychogenic
illness
,
even
though
a
psychological
overlay
is
common
.
it
is
true
that
poor
management
,
boring
work
,
poor
lighting
conditions
,
temperature
variations
,
poor
ergonomic
design
,
and
noise
may
all
lower
the
threshold
for
complaint
.
nevertheless
,
air
quality
complaints
usually
have
some
basis
,
although
they
are
often
difficult
to
assess
with

however
,
a
very
important
constituent
of

is

the

it
is
important
to
note
that
osha
considers
these
health
effects
to
be
material
impairments
of
health
when
the
worker
is
clinically
diagnosed
with
a
condition
that
is
either
caused
or
aggravated
by
poor

health
effects
caused
by
poor

in
1983
,
the
world
health
organization
published
a
list
of
eight
noninclusive
inclusive
symptoms
that
characterize
sick
building
syndrome
[

these
include
irritation

respiratory

and
cough
;
hoarseness
of
voice
and
wheezing
;
hypersensitivity
reactions
;
and
nausea
and
dizziness
.
generally
,
these
conditions
are
not
easily
traced
to
a
specific
substance
,
but
are
perceived
as
resulting
from
some
unidentified
contaminant
or
combination
of
contaminants
.
symptoms
are
relieved
when
the
employee
leaves
the
building
and
may
be
reduced
or
eliminated
by
modifying
the
ventilation
system

comments

that
such

have
been
observed

reported
by

in
