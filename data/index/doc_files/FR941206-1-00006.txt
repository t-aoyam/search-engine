among
the
areas
identified
in
the
rti
study
is
mechanically
separated
product
.
it
notes
that
regulations
exist
on
the
use
of
mss
,
but
not
on
the
use
of
mdp
.
the
rti
study
concluded
that
,
in
general
,
`
the
regulations
covering
meat
and
poultry
have
been
designed
with
the
same
intentto
protect
`
the
health
and
welfare
of
consumers
by
assuring
that
meat
and
meat
food
products
[
or
poultry
products
]
are
wholesome
,
not
adulterated
,
and
properly
marked
,
labeled
,
and
packaged

and

.
although
the
intent
of
the
regulations
remains
the
same
,
the
actual
requirements
are
quite
different
'
the
study
further
concludes
that
the
bases
for
no
comparable
regulation
for
mdp
are
`
unfavorable
consumer
perceptions
and
court
decisions
resulting
in

and
use
restrictions
for

poultry
has
no
definitional
requirements

'
mechanically
separated
red
meat
food
product
became
the
subject
of
consumer
criticism
in
the
mid1970s
mid
after
usda
proposed
to
allow
its
use
in
meat
products
and
to
allow
it
to
be
labeled
as
meat
(
ie
,
beef
or
pork
.
usda
also
issued
an
interim
rule
that
included
standards
for
the
use
of
mechanically
separated
red
meat
product
.
a
lawsuit
soon
followed
in
which
the
court
found
that
this
product
is
not
`
meat
'
as
traditionally
defined
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
meat
inspection
act
.
the
court
further
found
that
usda
had
not
considered
adequately
the
health
and
safety
effects
of
mechanically
separated
red
meat
food
product
.
to
respond
to
questions
on
health
and
safety
raised
by
the
court
,
a
panel
of
government
scientists
was
convened
to
examine
the
questions
.
the
panel
found
that
scientific
studies
established
no
unique
health
risks
associated
with
mechanically
separated
red
meat
food
product
,
but
that
the
product
is
sufficiently
different
from
muscle
tissue
meat
in
consistency
and
composition
to
require
separate
labeling
.
the
panel
recommended
,
among
other
things
,
that
usage
limitations
be
placed
on
this
product
.

the
panel
reports
,
among
other
things
,
led
fsis
to
issue
final
regulations
on
06/20/1978
,
that
established
preparation
,
composition
,
usage
,
and
labeling
requirements
for
mechanically
separated
red
meat
food
product
and
required
that
it
be
produced
only
under
a
quality
control
program
approved
by
the
agency
(
43
fr
26416
.
this
rule
established
a
definition
and
standard
of
identity
for
this
product
that
necessitated
it
being
listed
separately
from
meat
in
the
ingredients
statement
of
a
product
in
which
it
was
used
.
additional
rulemaking
on
06/29/1982
,
reaffirmed
the
agencys
position
that
the
product
,
now
called
mss
,
is
not
`
meat
'
as
traditionally
defined
(
47
fr
28214
.
during
this
same
period
,
mdp
underwent
product
development
separately
from
mechanically
separated
red
meat
food
product
without
similar
fsis
regulation
.
early
distinctions
in
regulatory
treatment
were
largely
due
to
historical
differences
in
how
the
two
industries
used
these
products
and
the
way
in
which
they
came
to
public
attention
.
one
significant
difference
is
that
mechanically
separated
red
meat
food
product
was
being
considered
for
use
in
products
that
had
previously
contained
muscle
meat
.
the
use
of
mdp
in
poultry
hotdogs
created
less
controversy
.
poultry
hotdogs
did
not
exist
before
they
were
made
with
mdp
.
thus
,
consumers
had
no
prior
expectations
about
the
formulation
.
differences
in
regulatory
treatment
of
the
product
,
now
called
mss
,
and
mdp
have
continued
since
that
time
.
the
meat
industry
claims
that
the
effect
of
those
differences
has
been
a
reluctance
on
the
part
of
processors
to
use
mss
,
while
mdp
use
has
expanded
.
in
response
to
the
early
rulemakings
on
mss
,
the
meat
industry
claimed
that
consumers
would
not
buy
products
if
mss
)
is
listed
on
the
label
.
similarly
,
in
responding
to
the
03/19/1994
advance
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
(
anpr
)
on
mdp
(
discussed
later
in
this
document
,
the
poultry
industry
claimed
that
,
if
they
had
to
label
mdp
as
a
poultry
ingredient
,
consumers
would
be
misled
into
thinking
that
they
are
purchasing
products
inferior
to
what
they
have
historically
purchased
or
that
the
product
has
changed
.
if
the
industry
believes
that
consumers
will
be
misled
into
thinking
the
product
has
changed
,
it
should
find
some
way
other
than
inaccurate
labeling
to
assure
them
it
is
the
same
product
.
the
agency
believes
that
if
the
current
labeling
is
misleading
,
it
has
no
choice
but
to
assure
that
the
ingredients
statement
accurately
informs
the
consumer
what
is
in
the
product
.
if
consumers
would
behave
differently
with
different
information
,
then
that
is
itself
evidence
that
the
information
is
important
to
them
.
it
is
the
agencys
responsibility
under
its
consumer
protection
mission
to
assure
the
information
is
accurate
and
not
misleading
.
