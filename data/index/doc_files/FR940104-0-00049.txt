;
(

;
(

)
operation

from

;
and
(

monitoring
of

incidental

at
the

.
the

minimize

taking
of

winter
run
chinook
salmon
incidental
to
the
operation
of

.
this
take
statement
identifies
the
level
of
incidental
taking
by
the
bureau
and

to
be
no
more
than
1
percent
of
the
estimated
number
of
outmigrant
juvenile
winterrun
winter

chinook
salmon
entering
the
delta
in
any
year
,
and
requires
the

and
the
state
to
submit
daily
,

,
and
annual
reports
based
on
an
extensive

to

is

.
based
on
the
1992
run
size
estimate
(
1180

,
nmfs
determined
that
the
allowable
take
of
outmigrating
juvenile
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
incidental
to
operation
of
the
export
facilities
in
199293

.
monitoring
of
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
incidental
take
during
the
1993
outmigration
season
indicated
that
the
level
of
taking
was
substantially
higher
at
the
state
export
facility
than
at
the
federal
export
facility
.
the
monitoring
program
also
indicated
that
the
rate
of
taking
by
mid02/19/1993
mid
was
higher
than
anticipated
,
and
that
continued
high
pumping
rates
could
result
in
exceeding
the
annual
take
level
authorized
by
nmfs
.
as
a
result
,
the
state
voluntarily
curtailed
pumping
at
its
delta
pumping
facility
in
late
february
to
reduce
the
loss
rate
and
cumulative
loss
of
juvenile
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
at
its
facility
.
although
pumping
rates
were
gradually
increased
during
march
and
04/19/1993
at
the
state
facility
,
the
cumulative
loss
of
juveniles
was
less
than
1
percent
of
the
estimated
outmigrant
population
in
1993
.
as
a
result
of
these
and
other
actions
taken
by
the
state
and
bureau
in
accordance
with
the
02/12/1993
,
biological
opinion
and
incidental
take
statement
,
nmfs
believes
that
the
survival
of
outmigrating
juveniles
in
1993
was
significantly
improved
over
previous
years
.
continued
implementation
of
these
protective
measures
in
future
years
is
expected
to
improve
outmigration
success
of
juvenile
winterrun

and
aid
in

suisun

operation
of
the

salinity
control
gate
structure
by
the
state
can
potentially
affect

chinook
adversely
by
diverting
outmigrating
juveniles
from
the
sacramento
river
into
montezuma
slough
where
conditions
for
survival
are
poorer
because
diverted
fish
have
a
longer
migration
route
,
and
are
exposed
to
increased
water
temperatures
,
increased
predation
,
and
numerous
unscreened

diversions
.

may
also
be
blocked
or

by
operation
of
the

as
they
attempt
to
migrate
into
the
sacramento

.
in
order
to
minimize
impacts
on
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
juveniles
,
nmfs
required
(
in
the
1992
cvp
opinion
)
that
salinity
control
gates
to
either
close
from
march
1
through
april
15
,
or
that
unscreened
diversions
in
the
slough
not
operate
during
this
period
.
the
california
departments
of
water
resources
and
fish
and
game
conducted
monitoring
during
this
period
and
provided
documentation
to
nmfs
that
these
diversions
were
not
operated
.
however
,
sampling
by
fws
during
04/19/1992
also
indicated
that
only
a
small
percentage
of
marked
juvenile
salmonids
(
0215
percent
)
were
diverted
into
montezuma
slough
.
since
the
potential
impacts
of
operating
the
salinity
control
gates
on
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
are
unclear
based
on
the
available
information
,
nmfs
addressed
the
need
for
additional
studies
at
the
facility
in
the
incidental
take
statement
included
with
the
1993
cvp
biological
opinion
.
specifically
,
the
incidental
take
statement
requires
the
bureau
and
the
state
to
develop
and
implement
a
program
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
operating
the
salinity
control
structure
on
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
by
spring
1994
.
the
program
is
expected
to
assess
the
diversion
rate
of
chinook
salmon
juveniles
into
montezuma
slough
,
predation
at
the
structure
,
survival
of
juveniles
passing
through
the
slough
,
and
passage
of
adults
upstream
.
droughts
el
nintildeo
the
natural
factors
of
greatest
concern
to
nmfs
are
drought
conditions
and
the
oceanographic
phenomenon
known
as
el
nintildeo
.
the
effects
of
the
extended
19871992
drought
on
californias
water
supply
have
likely
exacerbated
the
effects
of
management
of
state
and
federal
water
operations
and
other
activities
on
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
over
the
past
several
years
.
however
,
the
end
of
the
drought
in
1993
due
to
above
normal
levels
of
precipitation
throughout
the
state
,
and
the
implementation
of
protective
measures
contained
in
nmfs
02/12/1993
,
biological
opinion
are
expected
to
reduce
the
adverse
effects
of
drought
in
future
years
by
ensuring
that
minimum
carryover
storage
is
maintained
in
shasta
reservoir
each
year
,
and
that
conservative
water
supply
forecasts
are
used
by
the
bureau
to
make
annual
water
allocation
decisions
.
in
addition
to
these
measures
,
the
bureau
is
expected
to
construct
a
temperature
control
device
at
shasta
reservoir
that
should
improve
its
ability
to
provide
suitable
water
temperatures
in
the
upper
sacramento
river
.
the
el
nintildeo
event
that
began
in
19911992
may
result
in
reduced
ocean
survival
of
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
produced
in
1990
and
1991
when
the
estimated
run
sizes
were
very
low
(
441
and
191
fish
respectively
)
and
drought
conditions
prevailed
.
for
these
and
other
reasons
,
nmfs
anticipated
that
the
1993
run
size
would
be
low
,
and
also
expects
that
the
run
size
in
1994
will
be
weak
.
the
only
measure
that
may
help
to
mitigate
the
impact
of
el
nintildeo
events
may
be
the
hatchery
supplementation
program
developed
by
the
fws
to
augment
natural
juvenile
production
.
if
the
hatchery
supplementation
program
proves
to
be
successful
,
it
may
provide
the
necessary
juvenile
production
to
offset
any
adverse
effects
of
el
nintildeo
conditions
.
