supplementary
information
:
in
the
federal
register
of
05/12/1993
(
58
fr
28194
,
fda
published
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
for
otc
sunscreen
drug
products
.
in
the
proposed
rule
,
the
agency
discussed
otc
sunscreen
drug
products
that
claim
to
provide
protection
from
uva
radiation
and
the
public
health
significance
of
uva
radiation
(
58
fr
28194
at
28232
and
28233
.
the
agency
also
discussed
testing
procedures
for
sunscreens
that
absorb
uva
radiation
(
58
fr
28194
at
28248
to
28250
.
the
comment
period
for
comments
related
to
uva
ingredients
,
claims
,
and
testing
closed
on
11/08/1993
.
to
ensure
that
sunscreen
drug
products
having
uva
protection
claims
offer
significant
uva
protection
,
the
agency
proposed
that
an
otc
sunscreen
ingredient
must
have
an
absorption
spectrum
extending
to
360
nanometers
(
nm
)
or
above
in
order
to
display
uva
protection
claims
in
its
labeling
(
58
fr
28194
at
28233
.
the
product
would
also
have
to
demonstrate
meaningful
uva
protection
by
satisfying
uva
testing
procedures
that
would
be
included
in
the
monograph
.
however
,
these
procedures
have
yet
to
be
established
.
the
agency
requested
specific
comments
on
appropriate
procedures
to
be
used
.
previously
,
the
agency
had
requested
specific
information

uva
protection
factors
