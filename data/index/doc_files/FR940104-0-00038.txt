in

,
the
cdfg
estimated
that
the
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
run
size
was
only
547
fish
.
this
unexpectedly
small
return
represented
nearly
a
75
percent
decline
from
the
consistent
,
but
low
,
run
size
of
2000
to
3000
fish
that
had
occurred
since
1982
.
as
a
result
of
this
unexpected
decline
,
nmfs
issued
an
emergency
interim
rule
listing
the
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
as
threatened
under

on

(

during
the
period
the
emergency
interim
rule
was
in
effect
,
nmfs
published
a
proposed
rule
to
list
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
as
threatened
under
the
formal
listing
procedures
of
the

on

to
avoid
a
hiatus
in
protection
of
the
species
until

was
completed
,
nmfs
published
a
second

listing
winterrun
winter

chinook
salmon
as
threatened
on
04/02/1990
(

on

nmfs
completed
the
formal

process
and
published
a
final
rule
(

)
listing
the
species
as
threatened
under
the

.
on
06/05/1991
,
the
american
fisheries
society
petitioned
nmfs
to
reclassify
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
as
an
endangered
species
.
at
the
time
the
petition
was
submitted
,
the
best
preliminary
data
available
indicated
that
the
1991
run
would
consist
of
a
return
of
only
88
to
200
adults
from
the
progeny
of
the
1988
run
of
2085
fish
.
the
final
run
size
estimate
made
by
the
cdfg
for
1991
was
191
fish
(

.
nmfs
reviewed
the
petition
and
determined
that
it
contained
substantial
information
indicating
that
the
petitioned
action
might
be
warranted
.
on
11/07/1991
,
nmfs
announced
(
56
fr
58986
)
its
intention
to
review
the
status
of
the
species
to
determine
whether
reclassification
was
appropriate
.
after
conducting
a
status
review
,
nmfs
published
a
proposed
rule
(
57
fr
27416
)
on
06/19/1992
,
to
reclassify
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
as
endangered
.
nmfs
published
a
subsequent
federal
register
notice
(
58
fr
31688
)
on
06/04/1993
,
delaying
the
issuance
of
a
final
determination
on
the
reclassification
for
up
to
six
months
pursuant
to
section
4b6b
)
of
the
esa
.
on
09/10/1993
,
nmfs
published
another
federal
register
notice
that
provided
information
on
the
1993
run
size
estimate
(
341
fish
)
and
reopened
the
public
comment
period
on
the
proposed
rule
.
this
determination
does
not
change
any
of
the
prohibitions
against

.
section
9
of
the

prohibits
taking

.
the
regulations
issued
when
this
species
was
listed
as

in

also

fish

service
(

,
which
is
responsible
for
the
list
of
endangered
and
threatened
wildlife
,
will
revise
the
list
to
reflect
the
reclassification
of
this
species
from

to

.
current
status
conservation
measures
were
implemented
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation
(
bureau
)
beginning
in
19861987
in
an
effort
to
improve
adult
passage
conditions
for
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
at
red
bluff
diversion
dam
and
to
provide
suitable
spawning
and
egg
incubation
conditions
for
the
species
in
the
upper
sacramento
river
below
keswick
dam
.
despite
the
implementation
of
measures
in
19861987
and
19871988
,
the
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
run
size
declined
to
441
fish
in
1990
and
to
191
fish
in
1991
.
the
estimated
1991
run
size
of
191
fish
was
primarily
the
result
of
surviving
progeny
from
the
1988
spawning
population
of
2085
fish
.
thus
,
the
1991
spawning
escapement
represented
nearly
a
90
percent
decline
in
a
single
generation
,
and
suggested
that
the
1988
year
class
was
nearly
a
total
failure
