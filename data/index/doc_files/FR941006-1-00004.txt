supplementary
information
:
the
regulations
concerning
veterinary
biological
products
in
9
cfr
1025e
)
provide
that
:
[
where
the
administrator
determines
that
the
protection
of
domestic
animals
or
the
public
health
,
interest
,
or
safety
,
or
both
necessitates
restrictions
on
the
use
of
a
product
,
the
product
shall
be
subject
to
such
additional
restrictions
as
are
prescribed
on
the
license
.
such
restrictions
may
include
,
but
are
not
limited
to
,
limits
on
distribution
of
the
product
or
provisions
that
the
biological
product
is
restricted
to
use
by
veterinarians
,
or
under
the
supervision
of
veterinarians
,
or
both
.
the
animal
and
plant
health
inspection
service
(
aphis
)
has
received
requests
from
the
national
association
of
state
public
health
veterinarians
(
nasphv
)
to
consider
proposing
a
federal
restriction
that
animal
rabies
vaccines
be
distributed
and
used
only
by
or
under
the
direct
supervision
of
a
licensed
veterinarian
.
the
nasphv
believes
that
a
uniform
national
restriction
would
result
in
:
(
1
)
proper
handling
of
animal
rabies
vaccines
to
help
ensure
potency
and
(
2
)
improved
documentation
of
animal
rabies
vaccinations
.
aphis
has
attempted
to
identify
specific
issues
that
need
to
be
addressed
prior
to
proposing
such
restrictions
on
animal
rabies
vaccines
.
the
agency
is
seeking
data
and
information
on
these
issues
for
consideration
before
it
decides
whether
or
not
to
proceed
with
such
a
proposal
.
