experimental

have
demonstrated
that
exposure
of
susceptible
people
to
low

mixtures
of
vocs
have
induced
mucous

and
pulmonary

.
some
of
these
studies
are
discussed
below

the
potential
of
indoor

to
produce
adverse

in
humans
was
demonstrated
by

in

these
researchers
studied
62
subjects
suffering
from
`

symptoms
.
these
subjects
reported
primarily
eye
and
upper
respiratory
tract
irritation
,
but
were
otherwise
healthy
individuals
that
did
not
suffer
from
asthma
,
allergy
,
or
bronchitis
.
the
subjects
were
exposed
to
a
mixture
of
vocs
in
concentrations
of
0
,
5

or
25
mg

.
these
concentrations
respectively
represented
`
clean
'
air
,
average
polluted
air
,
and
the
maximum
polluted
air
in
danish
households
.
after
exposure
,
a
digit
span
test
was
administered
.
the

found
significant
declines
in
performance
on
this
test

demonstrating

reported
that

to
increase

,
and
produce

,

did
not
affect

on
any

.
these
results
imply
that
persons
who
experience
symptoms
of
sbs
may
have
a
lower
threshold
for
certain
health
effects
compared
to
nonreactive
people
.
this
suggests
that
those
with
compromised
immune
response
(
eg
.
allergy
sufferers
)
may
be
at
elevated
risk
of
sbs
.
ahlstrom

[

that
synergistic

may
occur
when
one

interacts
with
other
indoor

ahlstrom

found
that
there
was
almost
a

)
when
mixed
with
100

indoor
air
from
a

where

was
reported
,
relative
to
10

the
report
of
the
canadian
interministerial
committee
on
indoor
air
quality
[
ex
.
4264
]
adopts
the
world
health
organizations
definition
of
health
:
`
health
refers
to
a
state
of
complete
physical
,
mental
,
and
social
well
being
,
and
not
just
the
absence
of
disease
or
infirmity
'
this
definition
was
adopted
to
allow
the
setting
of
indoor
air
quality
guidelines
based
on
`
comfort
'
as
well
as
`
health
.
the
report
observes
that
the
symptoms
of
sbs
are
sufficiently
general
or
subjective
that
they
may
be
indicative
of
several
other
medical
conditions
.
therefore
,
perhaps
the
best
indicator
that
workplace
exposure
may
play
a
role
in
the
symptoms
reported
by
an
individual
is
the
observation
that
symptoms
worsen
during
the
work
day
,
and
disappear
shortly
after
leaving
work
.
they
state
that
because
there
is
a
wide
variation
in
individual
susceptibility
,
based
on
genetics
,
age
,
medication
,
previous
exposure
to
pollutants
,
gender
,
and
state
of
health
,
especially
those
with
allergies
,
that
certain
individuals
may
be
more
sensitive
to
sbs
than
others
.

bioaerosols
the

a

,
comparing

if

then
it
is
possible
that

environmental
tobacco
smoke
the
burning
of
tobacco
in
enclosed
workplaces
releases
an
aerosol
containing
a
large
variety
of
solid
,
liquid
,
and
gas
phase
chemical
compounds
.
generation
of
tobacco
smoke
is
governed
by
the
source
emission
characteristics
of
smokers
and
their
tobacco
products
,
whereas
removal
is
primarily
determined
by
the
rate
of
replacement
of
building
air
by
outside
air
,
with
reemission
emission
of
surfacesorbed
surface
sorbed
compounds
playing
a
minor
role
.
natural
and
mechanical
ventilation
systems
are
designed
primarily
to
limit
the
accumulation
of
the
products
of
human
respiratory
metabolism
,
and
secondarily
to
limit
odor
;
not
to
control
the
byproducts
of
biomass
combustion
.
thus
,
smoking
indoors
creates
air
pollution
which
is
not
adequately
abated
by
customary
ventilation
systems
.
exposure
to
tobacco
smoke
primarily
occurs
through
the
inhalation
route
.
such
an
exposure
can
be
measured
by
the
determination
of
the
absorption
,
distribution
,
metabolism
and
excretion
of
tobacco
smoke
constituents
and
or
their
metabolites
.
however
,
relatively
few
of
these
individual
constituents
have
been
identified
and
characterized
.
also
,
measurement
of
all
components
in
tobacco
smoke
is
not
feasible
.
therefore
,
it
becomes
necessary
to
identify
a
marker
which
,
when
measured
,
will
accurately
represent
the
frequency
,
duration
and
magnitude
of
the
exposure
to
environmental
tobacco
smoke

issues
covered
include

the
