the
us

house
of
representatives
,
committee
on
public
works
and
transportation
,
authorized
the
anacostia
river
and
tributaries
study
in
a
re
solution
adopted
on
09/08/1988
.
the
resolution
requested
the
corps
of
engineers
to
determine
if
further
improvements
for
flood
control
,
navigation
,
erosion
,
sedimentation
,
water
quality
and
other
related
water
resources
needs
are
advisable
on
the
anacostia
river
and
tributaries
.

.
the
anacostia
river
basin
is
a
170square
square
mile
subbasin
sub
basin
of
the
potomac
river
.
headwaters
of
the
anacostia
river
are
in
the
piedmont
and
coastal
plain
areas
of
montgomery
and
prince
georges
counties
,
maryland
and
it
joins
with
the
potomac
river
in
the
district
of
columbia
.
the
entire
river
system
is
freshwater
;
although
,
the
tidal
influence
extends
for
approximately
9
miles
above
the
confluence
with
the
potomac
river
.
3
.
the
corps
of
engineers
involvement
in
the
basin
dates
back
more
than
115
years
and
includes
projects
and
programs
for
navigation
,
flood
control
,
debris
removal
and
aquatic
vegetation
control
.
these
federal
actions
have
served
their
intended
purposes
well
and
have
benefited
the
area
in
terms
of
improved
navigation
and
reduced
flood
damages
.
however
,
from
1902
through
the
1960s
,
project
construction
eliminated
approximately
2600
acres
of
wetlands
,
99000
linear
feet
of
aquatic
habitat
and
700
acres
of
bottomland
hardwoods
.
these
ecosystems
performed
numerous
beneficial
ecological
functions
for
the
anacostia
basin
and
the
associated
potomac
river
and
chesapeake
bay
.
one
of
the
primary
functions
of
these
ecosystems
is
fish
and
wildlife
habitat
.
historically
,
the
anacostia
river
basin
contained
a
diverse
assemblage
of
fish
and
wildlife
species
.
however
,
populations
of
many
species
have
sharply
declined
due
to
the
habitat
loss
and
degradation
in
the
anacostia
basin
.
