the
alternatives
considered
in

the
ea
were
(

)
the
`
no
purchase
'
alternative
and
(
2
)
to
continue
as
proposed
.
choosing
the
`
no

'
alternative
would
require
the
continued
operation
of
the
detroit
job
corps
center
under
the
present
inadequate

conditions
.
the
potential
for
an
enhanced
facility
and
improved
operational
efficiency
afforded
by
the
proposed

indicates
that
the
proposed
purchase

improvement
of

is
the
preferred
alternative

the

characteristics
of

of

minimizes

the

of

that

based
on

storm

will
not
be
degraded

detroit
has
an
abundance
of
water

electrical
power

natural

to
easily
serve

although
the
proposed

will
cause
an
increase
in

in

the
increase
in

is
not

to
adversely
affect

flow
on

a

city

several
emergency

service
the

several
major

four

the

the
implementation
of
the
job
corps
on

will
provide
jobs
for

could
add

based
on
the
information
gathered
during
the
preparation
of
the
ea
for
the
department
of
labor
,
employment
and
training
administration
,
the
office
of
job
corps
finds
that
the
relocation
of
the
detroit

corps
center
to
the
1800

location
in
detroit
,
will
not
cause

and
,
therefore
,
recommends
that

this
