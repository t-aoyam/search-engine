asbestos
in
construction
the
construction
industry
is
the
principal
market
for
asbestos
materials
and
products
in
the
united

,
accounting
for
68
percent
of
the

consumed

with
the
decline
in
consumption
of

asbestos
in

.
manufacturing
coupled
with
the
introduction
of
asbestos
substitutes
into
product
design
,
the
asbestos
construction
industry
has
shifted
away
from
activities
associated
with
installing
asbestos
products
.
instead
,
in
the
last
decade
concern
over
the
public
risk
presented
by
damaged
asbestos
in
place
,
as
well
as
the
practical
need
to
maintain
aging
interior
sections
in
commercial
and
residential
buildings
,
has
directed
the
asbestos
construction
industry
to
the
areas
of
demolition
,
removal
,
and
renovation
.
in
addition
,
custodial
personnel
occasionally
come
into
contact
with
asbestos
during
their
housekeeping
duties
.
the
construction
industry
is
comprised
of
a
large
number
of
firms
:
approximately
536300
establishments
in
1987
,
employing
just
over
5
million
workers

.
of
this
industry
total
,
423500
establishments
,
or
79
percent
,
employed
fewer
than
10
workers
,
while
only
93
percent
had
20
or
more
employees
.
the
prevalence
of
small
firms
is
partially
related
to
the
ease
of
entry
into
the
construction
industry
.
to
establish
a
construction
firm
generally
requires
minimal
capitalization
;
many
firms
,
in
fact
,
achieve
success
by
carrying
little
overhead
and
adapting
their
services
to
industry
trends
.
furthermore
,
a
sizable
share
of
proprietorships
in
the
industry
are
composed
of
selfemployed
self
employed
individuals
who
contract
their
own
services
,
and
who
shift
back
and
forth
from

status
to

status
as
opportunities

.
in
construction
,
unlike
manufacturing
,
the
typical
industry
endproduct
end
product
is
highly
differentiated
and
is
produced
at
a
site
selected
by
the
purchaser
.
due
to
this
degree
of
product
specificity
,
each
worksite
usually
has
its
own
pattern
of
material
use
,
building
methods
,
and
number
and
mix
of
workers
.
thus
,
considerable
variation
may
exist
in
actual
worker
use
of
,
or
contact
with
,
asbestos
materials
and
products
.
although
the
occasional
use
of
asbestos
products
appears
to
be

material

workers

and

.
worker
mobility
,
resulting
in
considerable
shifting
among
both
job
sites
and
employers
is
another
characteristic
of
the
industry
.
workers
tend
to
identify
with
their
craft
or
occupation
,
not
with
their
employer
[
lange
and

.
cyclical
changes
in
the
economy
and
seasonal
work
patterns
cause
variability
of
job
opportunities
,
with
a
large
portion
of
workers
frequently
entering
and
exiting
the
industry
.
collectively
,
these
factors
make
it
very
difficult
to
estimate
the
total
number
of
workers
exposed
to
asbestos

the
duration
