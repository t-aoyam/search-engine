the
final

requires
certain
engineering
controls

.
these

include
the

both

the

construction
.
the
evaluation
of
technological
feasibility
in
construction
focused
on
the
various
combinations
of
engineering
controls
,
work
practices
,
and
respiratory
protection
necessary
to
reduce
current
exposures
to
achieve
compliance
with
the
final
pel
of

.
in
addition
,
osha
examined
a
number
of
engineering
controls
,
work
practices
,
and
ancillary
requirements
which
will
directly
and
indirectly
contribute
to
reducing
employee
exposures
.
exposures
to
asbestos
in
the
construction
industry
were
classified
into
six
activity
categories
:
&
bull
;
new
construction
_
including
the
installation
of
asbestos
cement
(
a
c
)
pipe
and

falls
under

work
as

bull
;
asbestos
abatement
_
including
both
asbestos
removal
and
encapsulation
with
a
polymeric
coating
,
or
enclosure
.
asbestos
abatement
falls
under
asbestos
work
classes
i
and
iii
as
defined
in
the
revised
standard
.
&
bull
;
demolition
_
involving
asbestos
removal
prior
to
the
demolition
of
all
or
part
of
a
building
or
industrial
facility
that
contains
asbestos
materials
.
demolition
falls
under

as

and
spackling
,
acoustical

renovation
and
remodeling
generally
involve
contact
with
generic
building
materials
and
would
therefore
fall
under
asbestos
work
class
ii
as
defined
in
the
revised
standard
.
&
bull

routine
facility
maintenance
in
commercial
residential
buildings
and
in
general
industry
_
including
maintenance
and
repair
activities
involving
disturbance
of
asbestos
materials
and
products
(
for
example
,
repair
of
leaking
steam
pipes
,
ceiling
tiles
,
roofing
,
drywall
,
or
flooring
;
or
adjustment
of

asbestos
work
as

in
the
revised

when
maintenance
involves

custodial
work

including
sweeping
,
dusting
and
other
housekeeping
duties
that
occasionally
expose
building
maintenance
and
custodial
personnel
to
asbestos
.
custodial
work
falls

derived
baseline
exposure

construction
activity
from
a
database
that

osha
inspection
reports
,
expert
testimony
,
and
various
published
reports

the
technological
feasibility
assessments
for
this
final
revised
standard
were
influenced
by
expected
exposure
reduction
following
the
promulgation
of
the
1986
asbestos
standard
,
and
by
a
review
of
the
literature
,
including
submittals
to
the
osha
docket
(
h033e
.
osha
determined
in
1986
that
,
for
a
variety
of
construction
activities
,
it
was
feasible
to
reach
the
current
pel
of
02

through
the
use
of
available
engineering
controls
and
work
practices
