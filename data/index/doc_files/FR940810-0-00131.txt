construction
and
shipyard
employment
standards
:
housekeeping
practices
have
been
shown
to
be
effective
means
of
reducing
employee
exposure
to
asbestos
.
osha
is
specifying
that
the
now
required
cleaning
of
floors
and
surfaces
on
which
dust
containing
asbestos
can
accumulate
be
performed
at
least
once
per
shift
in
primary
and
secondary
manufacturing
.
in
addition
to
the
current
requirement
that
a
vacuum
containing
a
hepafilter
hepa
filter
must
be
used
,
where
feasible
,
wet
methods
must
also
be
used
for
cleanup
clean
.
once
asbestos
dust
is
entrained
,
it
can
accumulate
on
surfaces
leading
to
potentially
substantial
levels
of
exposure
.
routine
removal
of
dust
can
greatly
reduce
these
accumulations
and
the
risks
that
they
pose
.
there
was
little
overall
all
objection
to
this
provision
from
the
participants
in
the
rulemaking
process
.
however
,
the
asbestos
information
association
asked
that
osha
not
revise
the
current
housekeeping
requirements
which
specify
that
all
surfaces
be
maintained
as
free
as
practicable
of
accumulation
of
dusts
and
wastes
containing
asbestos
(

.
they
argue
that
if
osha
requires
once
per
shift
vacuuming
,
it
would
lead
to
less
effective
housekeeping
efforts
since
vacuuming
might
then
occur
at
a
later
time
in
the
areas
most
in
need
of
housekeeping
than
occurs
with
current
cleanup
whenever
a
fiber
accumulation
occurs
'
osha
is
unconvinced
by
this
argument
.
if
the
employer
believes
that
more
frequent
cleanup
is
needed
,
it
should
be
performed
.
the
standard
merely
requires
that
vacuuming
be
done
no
less
often
than
once
per
shift
.
the
employer
can
determine
when
during
a
shift
,
vacuuming
is
most
useful
and
perform
it
then
.
flooring
maintenance
requirements
there
are
now
a
new
§
1926
1101
(
g2iv
)
and
1910
1001
,
which
prohibit
the
sanding
of
floor
tiles
containing
asbestos
.
further
,
only
low
abrasion
pads
may
be
used
at
speeds
lower
than
300
rpm
in
`
stripping
'
operations
,
and
stripping
of
unwaxed
or
unfinished
floor
tile
containing
asbestos
is
prohibited
.
osha
believes
that
without
such
restrictions
this
type
of
mechanized
activity
may
result
in
the
release
of
significant
levels
of
asbestos
fibers
into
the
air
.
in
addition
,
the
new
provisions
allow
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
floors
to
be
mechanically
buffed
without
limitation
on
the
speed
of
the
buffing
machine
,
so
long
as
the
floor
has
sufficient
finish
to
preclude
contact
between
the
pad
and
the
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
material
.
in
most
cases
,
at
least
3
layers
of
wax
will
provide
that
margin
.
if
the
manufacturers
instructions
specify
a
thicker
wax
layer
,
those
instructions
must
be
followed
.
(

of

issa
.
these
requirements
are
changed
in
some
respects
from
the
07/19/1990
proposal
,
which
would
have
further
restricted
stripping
and
burnishing
activities
.
the
prohibition
concerning
`
sanding
'
of
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
floors
was
supported
by
issa
and
others
,
and
it
unchanged
from
the
proposal
.
(
see
ex
.
136d
.
the
changes
from
the
proposal
reflect
the
comments
and
data
submitted
to
the
record
.
the
data
show
that
now
permitted
activities
are
not
expected
to
result
in
the
release
of
significant
asbestos
contamination
.
in
addition
,
since
oshas
proposal
had
used
various
terms
relating
to
floor
care
imprecisely
,
the
final
provisions
conform
the
language
to
the
common
understandings
of
the
floor
care
industry
.
thus
,
`
stripping
'
is
defined
as
a
wet
process
to
remove
the
floor
polish
or
finish
using
chemical
strippers
,
or
abrasive
pads
.
(
see
ex
.
136d
,
issas
comments
.
`
burnishing
'
is
dry
buffing
of
floor
polish
by
a
highspeed
high
speed
rotary
disc
machine
or
otherwise
.
the
core
requirements
of
oshas
new
provisions
are
that
no
`
sanding
,
ie
.
the
abrading
of
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
material
to
even
out
the
surface
,
is
allowed
:
that
`
stripping
'
of
finishes
of
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
flooring
must
be
conducted
wet
using
the
least
abrasive
pad
possible
;
and
that
burnishing
may
be
performed
only
on
floors
which
have
sufficient
finish
so
that
the
pad
does
not
contact
the
unfinished
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
material
.
osha
believes
that
these
three
principles
of
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
floor
maintenance
are
sufficiently
clear
and
flexible
to
apply
to
all
kinds
of
floor
maintenance
activities
,
even
if
the
activity
is
described
using
different
terminology
.
osha
is
basing
these
provisions
primarily
on
the
results
of
studies
submitted
during
the
rulemaking
.

in
the
most
thorough
and
detailed
study
submitted
