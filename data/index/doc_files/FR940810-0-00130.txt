many

that

should

felt
the

requirements
were
adequate
(

some
objected
to
osha
specifying

in

bctd
argued
that
ahera
training
was
inadequate
for
oshas
purposes
,
and
that
any
employee
in
a
building
containing
either
acm
or
pacm
who
does
not
intentionally
handle
the
material
should
receive
at
least
4
hours
of
awareness
training
and
that
any
worker
who
disturbs
acm
during
repair
,
renovation
,
demolition
or
maintenance
work
needs
the
full

course
(

under
the
training
provisions
of
ahera
,
all
members
of
the
maintenance
and
custodial
staffs
(
of
schools
)
who
may
work
in
a
building
containing
acbm
are
required
to
receive
at
least
2
hours
of
`
awareness
'
training
whether
or
not
they
are
required
to
work

(

.
those
who
conduct
an
activity
which
will
result
in
disturbance
of
acbm
shall
receive
both
the
awareness
training
and
14
additional
hours
of
training
.
epa
set
as
a
minimum
that
the
awareness
training
cover
:
_
information
of
uses
and
forms
of
asbestos
in
buildings
;
_
information
on
health
effects
of
exposure
to
asbestos
;
_
location
of
acbm
in
building
where
employee
works
;
_
recognition
of
deteriorating
or
damaged
acbm
;
and
,
_
the
identity
of
person
responsible
for
management
of
acbm
.
while
the
more
extensive
training
needed
by
those
who
might
disturb
acm
include
in
addition
:
_
description
of
proper
methods
to
handle
acbm
;
_
information
on
respirator
protection
_
the
provisions
of
the
ahera
rule
;
and
,
_
handson
hands
on
training
on
the
use
of
protective
equipment
and
work
practices
information
in
this
rulemaking
discussed
above
shows
that
workers
who
have
performed
work
now
designated
class
iii
and
iv
have
developed
asbestosrelated
asbestos
related
disease
.
because
as
noted
above
,
training
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
instruments
to
protect
workers
,
osha
believes
that
its
former
training
provisions
must
be
improved
by
incorporating
additional
curricula
such
as
covered
in
the
ahera
courses
for
such
workers
.
imposing
time
criteria
for
courses
will
help
insure
that
sufficient
time
for
instruction
is
provided
.
more
time
can
always
be
allotted
,
as
needed
