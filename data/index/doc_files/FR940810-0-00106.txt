in
this
evaluation
,
niosh
concluded
that
there
was
a
hazard
from
exposure
to
airborne
asbestos
fibers
during
the
tearoff
tear
off
of
an
asbestos
shingle
roof
and
recommended
several
practices
to
reduce
worker
exposure
.
osha
notes
that
in
some
cases
,
the
author
of
the
above
studies
recommend
more
rigorous
controls
than
the
final
standards
require
.
largely
,
this
was
based
on
evaluations
of
roofing
removal
exposure
potential
based
on
small
numbers
of
tem
measurements
.
as
stated
elsewhere
in
this
document
,
osha
has
based
its
risk
assessment
,
and
relative
exposure
profiles
on
the
results
of
many
studies
which
relied
on
pcm
values
.
osha
considered
tem
in
the
1986
standard
and
concluded
that
it
was
quite
expensive
and
not
fully
validated
.
more
importantly
,
osha
believes
that
the
roofing
studies
submitted
show
the
relatively
low
levels
of
asbestos
fibers
emitted
during
removal
work
when
proper
controls
are
used
.
the
small
number
of
exceedances
which
occurred
reflect
poor
work
practices
and
`
uncharacterized
and
aged
material
'
the
purpose
of
the
regulated
area
in
the
asbestos
standards
is
to
prevent
asbestos
contamination
of
other
parts
of
the
workplace
and
to
limit
exposure
to
only
those
specially
trained
employees
who
need
to
work
in
the
area
.
while
osha
does
not
want
to
shut
down
the
entire
building
when
asbestos
work
is
done
on
the
roof
,
asbestos
entering
the
ventilation
system
during
roofing
work
is
clearly
unacceptable
.
osha
expects
good
judgment
to
be
used
by
the
competent
person
in
striving
to
achieve
the
intent
of
the
standard
.
osha
requires
that
roof
level
heating
and
ventilation
air
intake
sources
must
be
isolated
.
the
employer
would
also
have
the
option
to
shut
down
the
ventilation
system
and
seal
it
with
plastic
.
only
necessary
work
should
be
done
on
the
roof
while
asbestos
materials
are
being
removed
,
and
the
locations
of
the
work
should
be
selected
to
minimize
exposures
,
such
as
upwind
of
the
asbestos
work
.
osha
agrees
that
the
20
foot
barrier
approach
recommended
by
mr
.
collins
(
ex
.
752
)
has
merit
,
but
believes
the
exact
determination
should
be
made
on
site
,
and
could
vary
depending
upon
working
conditions
.
osha
concludes
that
removal
of
roofing
material
containing
asbestos
requires
the
use
of
controls
to
reduce
significant
risk
.
simple
procedures
will
reduce
exposure
levels
substantially
and
,
for
the
most
part
,
will
reduce
levels
below
the
pels
.
osha
believes
that
it
is
appropriate
to
require
specification
work
practices
for
removal
of
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
roofing
material
,
regardless
of
measure
exposure
levels
.
as
discussed
above
,
these
controls
were
recommended
by
rulemaking
participants
,
although
there
was
some
disagreement
regarding
the
need
for
some
of
the
controls
.
the
final
standard
requires
the
use
of
wet
methods
and
continuously
misting
cutting
machines
during
use
and
loose
dust
left
by
the
sawing
operation
is
to
be
hepa
vacuumed
immediately
.
some
commenters
were
concerned
that
water
could
create
safety
hazards
,
so
the
standard
reflects
that
the
competent
person
could
determine
that
misting
the
cutting
machine
,
or
other
wet
methods
,
should
not
be
used
.
if
wet
methods
are
not
used
the
respiratory
protection
provision
of
this
standard
,
paragraph
(
h
)
requires
that
respirators
be
used
regardless
of
exposure
level
.
this
provision
is
based
upon
oshas
finding
that
dry
disturbance
or
removal
of
asbestos
containing
material
has
large
potential
to
expose
workers
and
is
in
accordance
with
that
of
epa
neshap
.
other
controls
include
removing
the
roofing
material
in
an
intact
state
to
the
extent
feasible
,
immediately
lower
unbagged
or
unwrapped
roofing
material
to
the
ground
via
dusttight
dust
tight
chute
,
crane
or
hoist
,
or
wrapping
the
roofing
material
in
plastic
sheeting
and
lowering
it
to
the
ground
,
transferring
materials
immediately
to
a
closed
receptacle
in
a
manner
so
as
to
preclude
the
dispersion
of
dust
,
and
sealing
off
air
intakes
to
the
building
prior
to
doing
any
roofing
removal
.
osha
concludes
from
the
studies
that
exposures
can
go
over
the
pel
and
create
significant
risk
in
circumstances
when
appropriate
precautions
are
not
take
.
consequently
,
they
support
osha
requirement
for
some
specific
work
practices
in
all
circumstances
.
methods
of
compliance
for

the
newly
revised

and
shipyard

standards
continue
to
regulate
exposure
to
employees
engaged
in
repairing
and
maintaining
building
components
which
contain
previously
installed
asbestos
containing
material
.
in
the
1986
construction

,
most
of
these
jobs
were
called

but
,
as
discussed
above
,
osha
was
instructed
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
clarify
the
cutoffs
cut
offs
for
that
designation
.
now
,
osha
has
determined
that
separate

of
repair
and
maintenance

will
not
be
limited
by
arbitrary

instead
,
they
are
called

and
are

which
may
involve

the
major
difference
between
the
newly
revised
repair
and
maintenance
definitions
,
is
that
the
amount
of
material
and
or
the

the

takes

no

for
