pollution
prevention
considerations
the
pollution
prevention
act
of
1990
establishes
the
following
environmental
management
hierarchy
as
national
policy
:
1
.
pollution
should
be
prevented
or
reduced
at
the
source
wherever
feasible
;
2
.
pollution
that
cannot
be
prevented
should
be
recycled
in
an
environmentally
safe
manner
wherever
feasible
;
3
.
pollution
that
cannot
be
prevented
or
recycled
should
be
treated
in
an
environmentally
safe
manner
wherever
feasible
;
and
4
.
disposal
or
other
release
into
the
environment
should
be
employed
only
as
a
last
resort
and
should
be
conducted
in
an
environmentally
safe
manner
.
the
pollution
prevention
act
considers
`
source
reduction
'
a
fundamental
aspect
of
pollution
prevention
.
source
reduction
is
any
practice
that
reduces
the
amount
of
any
hazardous
substance
entering
the
waste
stream
or
otherwise
released
into
the
environment
prior
to
recycling
,
treatment
,
or
disposal
.
practices
such
as
recycling
,
energy
recovery
,
treatment
,
and
disposal
are
not
considered
pollution
prevention
measures
under
the
pollution
prevention
act
.
as
noted
above
,
however
,
recycling
conducted
in
an
environmentally
safe
manner
is
still
desirable
.
the
proposed
rule
not
only
encourages
pollution
prevention
,
but
even
requires
certain
pollution
prevention
measures
.
by
expressing
the
proposed
emission
limit
for
finishing
operations
in
terms
of
kg
vhap
kg
solids
(
lb
vhap
lb
solids
,
sources
are
encouraged
to
reduce
the
quantity
of
hap
through
reformulation
measures
.
likewise
,
the
emission
limits
for
cleaning
and
gluing
operations
limit
voc
or
hap
content
and
sources
will
likely
comply
by
using
reformulated
materials
.
the
proposed
rule
allows
sources
to
comply
with
emission
limits
through
other
means
such
as
control
devices
,
which
would
not
be
pollution
prevention
.
the
proposed
work
practices
,
however
,
ensure
that
pollution
prevention
measures
will
be
implemented
at
all
major
sources
using
hap
for
finishing
,
gluing
,
cleaning
,
or
washoff
operations
.
source
reduction
of
hap
from
finishing
operations
is
achieved
by
prohibiting
the
use
of
conventional
air
spray
guns
except
in
limited
situations
.
as
previously
described
,
application
equipment
with
a
higher
transfer
efficiency
than
conventional
air
guns
will
result
in
lower
air
emissions
and
reduced
solid
waste
.
training
operators
in
proper
application
techniques
,
cleaning
and
washoff
procedures
,
and
waste
management
will
reduce
emissions
from
finishing
,
cleaning
,
gluing
,
and
washoff
operations
.
source
reduction
of
hap
from
cleaning
operations
is
achieved
by
prohibiting
the
use
of
solvent
for
spray
booth
cleaning
except
in
limited
situations
.
finally
,
although
it
cannot
be
assumed
that
it
will
actually
result
in
source
reduction
,
the
cleaning
and
washoff
solvent
accounting
system
may
prompt
facilities
to
eliminate
inefficient
uses
of
solvent
.
g
.
selection
of
compliance
and
monitoring
requirements
during
the
regulatory
negotiation
,
the
committee
discussed
general
compliance
measures
;
eg
,
that
compliance
would
be
achieved
through
recordkeeping
and
reporting
,
the
frequency
of
reporting
,
and
the
averaging
time
for
compliance
for
a
source
choosing
to
use
an
averaging
approach
to
meet
the
finishing
material
emission
limits
.
after
the
regulatory
negotiation
,
the
agency
included
the
general
concepts
agreed
to
by
the
committee
into
a
regulatory
framework
that
would
also
fulfill
the
requirements
of
the
amended
act
.
for
a
rule
to
be
effective
,
an
owner
or
operator
of
an
affected
source
must
demonstrate
both
initial
and
continuous
compliance
.
the
initial
and
continuous
compliance
measures
included
in
the
proposed
rule
account
for
situations
in
which
either
a
control
device
or
compliant
finishing
materials
,
adhesives
,
and
cleaning
materials
are
used
.
(
see
table
5
for
a
summary
of
the
proposed
compliance
and
monitoring
requirements
)
in
this
industry
,
it
is
likely
that
the
majority
of
sources
will
use
compliant
materials
to
comply
with
the
proposed
emission
limits
;
control
devices
are
likely
to
be
used
in
limited
situations
.
