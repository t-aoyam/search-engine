review
of
packaging
issues
in
citizen
petitions
two
of
the
citizen
petitions
suggested
that
fda
take
action
with
respect
to
the
packaging
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drugs
and
dietary
supplements
.
both
petitions
recommended
packaging
requirements
as
a
means
of
reducing
pediatric
poisonings
from
ingestion
of
multiple
doses
of
drugs
and
dietary
supplements
containing
30
mg
or
more
iron
per
dosage
unit
.
the
ag
citizen
petition
requested
that
fda
use
its
authority
under
the
act
to
require
that
all
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drugs
and
dietary
supplements
containing
30
mg
or
more
iron
per
dosage
unit
be
packaged
in
childresistant
child
resistant
blister
packs
.
the
ndma
petition
recommended
that
fda
incorporate
into
its
regulations
the
ndmainitiated
ndma
initiated
voluntary
program
to
address
pediatric
poisonings
by
such
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
this
voluntary
program
includes
,
in
part
,
a
proviso
that
all
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
currently
subject
to
cpscs
special
packaging
regulations
that
contain
30
mg
or
more
of

per

be
packaged
in

,
and
that
there
be
no
exemption
to
cpscs
childresistant
child
resistant
special
packaging
requirements
for
these
types
of
products
.
as
discussed
previously
,
ndmas
voluntary
program
also
specifies
labeling
statements
and
includes
an
educational
program
.
implicit
in
ndmas
recommendation
is
the
view
that
crcs
,
labeling
warning
statements
,
and
consumer
education
programs
are
sufficient
to
ensure
the
safe
use
of

agency
response
fda
considered
the
following
questions
in
evaluating
and
responding
to
the
packaging
issues
raised
in
the
citizen
petitions
:
(
1
)
can
educational
efforts
and
label
warning
statements
alone
sufficiently
reduce
pediatric
iron
poisonings
?
(
2
)
are
noncomplying
childresistant
child
resistant
packages
a
principal
cause
of
iron
poisoning
deaths
?
(

)
are
additional
packaging
requirements
necessary
to
ensure
the
safe
use
of
certain
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
?
(

)
what
is
fdas
legal
authority
to
regulate
packaging
for
foods
and
drugs
?
(

)
should
childresistant
child
resistant
blister
packaging
be
required
for
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
?
a
.
can
educational
efforts
and
label
warning
statements
significantly
reduce
pediatric
iron
poisonings
?
fda
agrees
with
ndma
that
educating
consumers
on
the
proper
use
of
crcs
and
on
the
hazards
posed
by
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drugs
and
supplements
is
very
important
.
however
,
based
on
the
available
evidence
,
even
if
all
crcs
were
properly
used
,
these
closures
could
not
have
prevented
the
majority
of
the
37
reported
fatalities
.
improper
use
of
crcs
was
reported
in
only
4
of
the
21
(
19
percent
)
pediatric
iron
fatalities
known
to
involve
childresistant
child
resistant
packaging
(

.
educational
programs
and
label
warning
statements
should
help
to
increase
proper
use
of
reclosable
crcs
,
and
thereby
help
to
prevent
some
pediatric
ironpoisonings
iron
poisonings
.
however
,
fda
knows
of
no
information
showing
that
a
consumer
education
program
,
either
that
recommended
by
ndma
or
any
other
such
program
,
will
be
adequate
to
ensure
that
children
will
not
be
able
to
defeat
even
properly
closed
crcs
,
or
that
improper
use
of
such
closures
will
cease
.
in
the
absence
of
such
information
,
fda
believes
that
measures
beyond
consumer
education
programs
are
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
use
of
certain
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
is
safe
.
fda
also
tentatively
finds
that
label
warning
statements
will
not
be
sufficient
to
ensure
the
safe
use
of
these
products
.
this
tentative
conclusion
is
based
on
the
fact
that
label
warning
statements
do
not
in
any
way
bar
access
to
the
product
.
label
statements
are
an
important
educational
tool
for
making
adults
aware
of
the
significant
consequences
for
young
children
if
they
gain
access
to
the
product
.
young
children
,
however
,
cannot
read
and
have
little
judgment
.
thus
,
a
warning
statement
is
likely
to
have
little
or
no
effect
on
their
efforts
to
gain
access
.
