supplementary
information
:
the
service
is
implementing
the
following
fee
schedule
for
commercial
guides
,
outfitters
,
and
transporters
that
are
issued
special
use
permits
to
conduct
commercial
operations
on
refuges
in
alaska
.
fees
for
other
nonrecreational
recreational
types
of
commercial
activities
that
involve
removing
marketable
resources
or
utilizing
reserved
sites
will
not
be
based
on
the
following
fee
schedule
.
fees
for
these
types
of
commercial
activities
will
be
determined
by
the
services
division
of
realty
and
will
be
based
on
fair
market
analysis
surveys
.
these
surveys
will
be
conducted
periodically
to
assure
that
fees
reflect
current
market
values
.
the
service
considered
a
number
of
methods
for
meeting
the
required
mandates
.
four
alternatives
were
given
serious
consideration
and
were
published
in
the
05/31/1991
,
federal
register
(
56
fr
24827
)
to
receive
public
comment
.
these
alternatives
were
:
(
1
)
a
single
fixed
fee
of
$
350
for
all
commercial
permittees
,
(
2
)
a
fee
schedule
based
on
type
of
commercial
use
activity
and
actual
client
numbers
,
(
3
)
a
fee
schedule
based
on
permittee
calculations
,
made
after
the
permit
use
period
,
of
3
%
of
adjusted
gross
income
derived
from
commercial
activities
that
are
authorized
by
special
use
permit
on
refuge
lands
,
and
(
4
)
a
fee
schedule
based
on
permittee
estimates
,
made
prior
to
the
permit
use
period
,
of
3
%
of
anticipated
adjusted
gross
income
derived
from
commercial
activities
that
are
authorized
by
special
use
permit
on
refuge
lands
.
the
service
had
proposed
to
adopt
alternative
4
because
it
appeared
that
it
would
be
(
1
)
equitable
to
all
commercial
use
permittees
,
regardless
of
the
scale
of
their
operation
;
(
2
)
charging
a
fair
market
value
;
(
3
)
reasonably
consistent
with
the
fee
schedule
of
other
federal
agencies
in
alaska
;
and
(
4
)
cost
effective
for
the
government
to
administer
.
thirtyfive
thirty
five
comments
were
received
from
individuals
,
professional
organizations
,
and
state
and
federal
agencies
in
response
to
the
published
federal
register
notice
.
after
review
and
consideration
of
the
comments
received
,
the
service
decided
not
to
implement
this
alternative
.
public
comments
identified
several
potential
inequities
in
the
originally
proposed
alternative
and
strongly
supported
a
flat
fee
or
a
client
useday
use
day
system
.
a
flat
fee
was
reconsidered
but
was
not
selected
because
the
service
believes
it
is
not
equitable
to
all
commercial
operators
since
the
scale
of
operations
is
highly
variable
among
users
.
as
a
result
of
public
comment
,
the
service
is
implementing
the
following
fee
system
which
is
based
on
the
type
of
activity
and
number
of
client
usedays
use
days
.
the
specific
fee
for
each
type
of
client
useday
use
day
is
based
on
an
adjusted
three
percent
of
gross
receipts
figure
which
returns
approximately
152
percent
of
the
typical
daily
rate
charged
to
clients
by
commercial
guides
,
outfitters
,
and
transporters
in
alaska
.
the
services
fee
schedule
system
requires
a
nonrefundable
refundable
$
100
administrative
fee
charged
at
the
issuance
of
a
permit
and
a
predetermined
fee
for
client
usedays
use
days
,
based
on
the
activity
,
charged
following
each
session
of
use
.

the
