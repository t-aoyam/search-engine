supplementary
information
:
purpose
of
the
proposal
this
proposal
would
amend
the
regulatory
requirements
for
the
finely
comminuted
poultry
product
resulting
from
the
mechanical
separation
and
removal
of
most
of
the
bone
from
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
and
for
the
finished
poultry
products
and
meat
food
products
in
which
this
product
is
used
as
an
ingredient
.
the
department
first
conducted
a
rulemaking
regarding
this
product
in
1969
.
over
the
years
,
the
amount
of
such
product
being
manufactured
and
the
number
and
range
of
poultry
products
and
meat
food
products
in
which
it
is
used
as
an
ingredient
,
has
increased
significantly
.
moreover
,
the
department
has
gained
a
great
deal
of
knowledge
from
its
rulemakings
regarding
the
livestock
product
resulting
from
the
mechanical
separation
and
removal
process
which
is
called
mechanically
separated

,
several
red
meat
sausage
manufacturers
alleged
that
,
without
a
regulatory
definition
and
standard
for
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
,
a
disparate
situation
exists
between
labeling
mechanically
separated
poultry
and
the
livestock
product
resulting
from
the
mechanical
separation
and
removal
process
for
which
a
regulatory
definition
and
standard
exist
.
the
red
meat
sausage
manufacturers
have
alleged
that
the
disparate
labeling
situation
poses
an
unfair
advantage
for
the
manufacturers
of
mechanically
separated
poultry
products
.
in
view
of
these
developments
,
and
taking
into
account
the
information
and
experience
acquired
since
1969
and
current
regulatory
policies
,
the
agency
reviewed
and
reevaluated
the
existing
regulations
,
particularly
in
light
of
the
labeling
issues
.
as
a
result
of
its
review
and
reevaluation
,
the
agency
believes
that
further
regulatory
action
is
necessary
pursuant
to
its
statutory
responsibilities
to
protect
the
public
and
prevent
the
preparation
and
distribution
in
commerce
of
poultry
products
and
meat
food
products
which
are
misbranded
or
not
properly
marked
,
labeled
,
or
packaged
