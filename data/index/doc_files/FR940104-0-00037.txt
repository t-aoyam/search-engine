summary
:
nmfs
has
determined
that
the
sacramento
river
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
should
be
reclassified
from
threatened
to
endangered
under
the
endangered
species
act
of
1973
(
esa
.
nmfs
has
determined
that
the
current
biological
status
of
the
species
is
endangered
based
on
the
continued
decline
and
increased
variability
of
run
sizes
since
its
first
listing
as
a
threatened
species
in
1989
,
the
expectation
of
weak
returns
in
certain
years
as
the
result
of
two
small
year
classes
(
1991
and
1993
,
and
continuing
threats
to
the
population
.
although
measures
implemented
through
consultations
conducted
under
section
7
of
the
esa
and
state
and
federal
regulatory
actions
are
designed
to
reduce
adverse
impacts
on
the
species
,
quantifiable
improvements
in
population
levels
are
not
likely
to
be
evident
for
several
years
.
nmfs
will
continue
to
closely
monitor
the
status
of
this
population
,
and
evaluate
the
protective
measures
to
determine
whether
there
is
evidence
that
these
measures
have
reduced
or
eliminated
threats
to
the
species
and
whether
a
change
in
status
may
be
warranted

background
under
the
esa
and
its
implementing
regulations
(

cfr
part
424
,
an
`
endangered
species
'
is
any
species
that
is
in
danger
of
extinction
throughout
all
or
a
significant
portion
of
its
range
.
a
`
threatened
species
'
is
any
species
that
is
likely
to
become
an
endangered
species
within
the
foreseeable
future
throughout
all
or
a
significant
portion
of
its
range
.
based
on
a
review
of
the
status
of
the
sacramento
river
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
and
the
factors
affecting
the
species
,
nmfs
has
determined
that
it
is
endangered
.
the
sacramento
river
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
is
a
unique
population
that
is
distinguishable
from
other
chinook
salmon
runs
in
the
sacramento
river
based
on
the
timing
of
its
upstream
migration
and
spawning
period
.
for
the
most
part
,
the
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
population
is
comprised
of
three
year
classes
,
each
of
which
primarily
returns
to
spawn
as
3year
year
old
fish
.
the
best
available
data
on
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
abundance
are
the
annual
estimates
of
the
spawning
run
size
made
by
the
california
department
of
fish
and
game
(
cdfg
)
based
on
counts
of
fish
passing
the
red
bluff
diversion
dam
.
the
cdfg
began
estimating
the
annual
run
size
for
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
in
1967
after
the
dam
was
placed
in
operation
.
this
time
series
of
annual
run
size
estimates
has
documented
a
precipitous
decline
in
the
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
to
its
present
low
level
