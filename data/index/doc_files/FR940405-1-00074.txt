in
developing
risk
estimates
for
disease
attributable
to
occupational
exposure
,
reliance
is
placed
on
exposure
encountered
in
the
workplace
to
the
extent
possible
.
however
,
in
the
absence
of
purely
occupational
data
,
information
derived
in
environments
other
than
work
sites
is
also
considered
.
osha
believes
that
there
is
no
physiological
difference
related
to
exposure
(
or
its
outcome
)
regardless
of
where
it
is
experienced
.
this
is
true
regardless
of
whether
the
endpoint
is
lung
cancer
,
heart
disease
,
or
indoor
air
related
acute
irritant
effects
.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
degree
of
exposure
may
be
greater
in
one
place
than
in
the
other
.
available
information
which
uses
nicotine
concentration
as
an
index
of
exposure
suggests
that
the
differences
in
exposure
between
office
workplaces
and
residences
lie
well
within
the
uncertainties
of
the
determinations
and
for
some
workplaces
,
such
as
restaurants
and
transportation
facilities
,
exposures
are
significantly
higher
than
the
average
exposures
found
in
residences
.
thus
,
risk
estimates
based
on
residential
exposures
are
expected
to
accurately
reflect
occupational
risks
in
most
workplaces
and
possibly
underestimate
the
risk
in
some
workplaces
.
in
developing
its
risk
assessment
for
lung
cancer
,
the
epa
reviewed
19
studies
which
investigated
nicotine
concentrations
in
various
environments
[
ex
.
4311
.
epas
analysis
showed
that
the
range
of
average
nicotine
concentrations
in
office
workplaces
is
very
similar
to
that
of
homes
.
however
,
in
some
workplaces
,
such
as
restaurants
and
transportation
facilities
,
exposures
are
significantly
higher
.
it
is
true
that
there
are
many
complicating
factors
in
such
determinations
which
could
affect
any
final
conclusions
.
for
example
,
it
is
important
to
consider
the
duration
of
exposure
,
the
intensity
of
exposure
,
the
distance
from
the
sources
and
other
factors
as
well
.
however
,
epas
analysis
suggests
that
risk
assessments
based
on
home
exposures
are
relevant
to
workplaces
as
well
and
,
in
comparison
to
some
workplaces
,
may
even
result
in
an
underestimate
of
the
true
occupational
risk
.
in
addition
,
other
studies
substantiate
the
magnitude
of
workplace
exposures
.
for
example
,
emmons

found
that
the
majority
of
ets
exposure
occurred
in
the
workplace
.
study
subjects
were
selected
from
workplace
settings
with
a
wide
range
of
ets
exposure
.
the
work
sites
ranged
from
those
with
minimal
restriction
of
smoking
and
high
levels
of
exposure
to
work
sites
with
extensive
smoking
restrictions
and
low
exposure
.
ninety
percent
of
the
subjects
worked
outside

.
eightyfour
eighty
four
percent
of
those
who
worked
outside
the
home
(
756
%
of
the
total
sample
)
reported
being
regularly
exposed
to
smoking
in
the
workplace
.
while
the
most
highly
exposed
individuals
in
the
study
were
those
who
had
both
home
and
work
exposures
,
it
is
clear
that
workplace
exposure
constituted
a
significant
component
of
overall
exposure
.
subjects
who
did
not
live
with
smokers
reported
that
the
majority
of
their
exposure
was
in
the
workplace
(

,
home
(

min

)
or
in
other
locations
(

min

.
subjects
who
lived
with
smokers
reported
receiving
slightly
more
exposure
at
home
than
the
workplace
,
however
the
difference
between
home
exposure
and
workplace
exposure
was
not
substantial
(

the
importance
of
the
findings
from
this
study
is
twofold
.
first
,
it
indicates
that
the
workplace
is
the
primary
source
of
ets
exposure
for
nonsmokers
,
who
do
not
live
with
smokers
.
secondly
,
it
shows
that
for
nonsmokers
living
with
smokers
,
even
though
their
household
environment
becomes
their
primary
source
of
exposure
,
the
workplace
still
contributes
a
substantial
amount
of
exposure
,
comparable
to
that
experienced
by
the
nonsmoker
living
with
nonsmokers
