(
the

the
material
on

note
that
percent
determination
must
be
done
in
the

analytical
procedure
note
:
this
method
presumes
some
knowledge
of
mineralogy
and
optical
petrography
.
the
analysis
consists
of
three
parts
:
the
determination
of
whether
there
is
asbestos
present
,
what
type
is
present
and
the
determination
of
how
much
is
present
.
the
general
flow
of
the
analysis
is
:
(

)
gross
examination
.
(

)
examination
under
polarized
light
on
the
stereo
microscope
.
(

examination
by

polar
illumination
on
the

.
(

determination
of
species
by
dispersion
stain
.
examination
by
becke
line
analysis
may
also
be
used
;
however
,
this
is
usually
more
cumbersome
for
asbestos
determination
.
(

)
difficult
samples
may
need
to
be
analyzed
by
sem
or
tem
,
or
the
results
from
those
techniques
combined
with
light
microscopy
for
a
definitive
identification
.
identification
of
a
particle
as
asbestos
requires
that
it
be
asbestiform
.
description
of
particles
should
follow
the
suggestion
of
campbell
