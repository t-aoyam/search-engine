`
quantitative
fit
test
'
means
the
measurement
of
the
effectiveness
of
a
respirator
seal
in
excluding
the
ambient
atmosphere
.
the
test
is
performed
by
dividing
the
measured
concentration
of
challenge
agent
in
a
test
chamber
by
the
measured
concentration
of
the
challenge
agent
inside
the
respirator

when
the
normal
air
purifying
element
has
been
replaced
by
an
essentially
perfect
purifying
element

`
challenge
agent
'
means
the
air
contaminant
introduced
into
a
test
chamber
so
that
its
concentration
inside
and
outside
the
respirator
may
be
compared
.

the
