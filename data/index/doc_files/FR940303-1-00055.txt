summary
:
the
food
safety
and
inspection
service
(
fsis
)
is
proposing
to
amend
the
federal
meat
inspection
regulations
by
amending
the
definition
of
meat
to
include
as
meat
product
resulting
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
recovery
systems
that
do
not
crush
,
grind
,
or
pulverize
bones
to
remove
attached
skeletal
tissue
from
the
bones
of
livestock
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
,
establishing
the
criteria
for
meat
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
meat
recovery
systems
to
assure
consistency
with
the
characteristics
and
composition
of
meat
,
and
establishing
requirements
for
the
handling
of
meat
derived
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
meat
recovery
systems
,
as
well
as
the
material
from
which
it
is
derived
.
this
action
is
being
taken
to
update
the
definition
of
meat
to
acknowledge
and
include
as
meat
product
derived
from
the
advances
made
in
the
modification
of
traditional
mechanical
means
of
separating
meat
from
the
bones
of
livestock
and
the
development
of
advanced
recovery
systems
that
do
not
involve
grinding
,
crushing
,
or
pulverizing
bones
to
remove
the
adhering
skeletal
tissue
.
