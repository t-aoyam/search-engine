the
usepa
has
submitted
a
request

the

this
request
continues
in
effect
under

which
superseded

the

nothing

should
be
construed
as
permitting
or
allowing

establishing
a
precedent
for
any
future
request
for
revision
to
any
sip
.
each
request
for
revision
to
any
sip
shall
be
considered
separately
in
light
of
specific
technical
,
economic
,
and
environmental
factors
and
in
relation
to
relevant
statutory
and
regulatory
requirements
.
under
the
regulatory

et

,
usepa
must
prepare
a
regulatory

assessing
the
impact
of

final

and

alternatively
,
usepa
may
certify
that
the

will
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small

.
small

sip
approvals
under
section
110
and
subchapter
i
,
part
d
of
the
act
do
not
create
any
new
requirements
,
but
simply
approve
requirements
that
the
state
is
already
imposing
.
therefore
,
because
the
federal
sipapproval
sip
approval
does
not
impose
any
new
requirements
,
i
certify
that
it
does
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
small
entities
affected
.
moreover
,
due
to
the
nature
of
the
federalstate
federal
state
relationship
under
the
act
,
preparation
of
a
regulatory
flexibility
analysis
would
constitute
federal
inquiry
into
the
economic
reasonableness
of
state
action
.
the
act
forbids
usepa
to
base
its
actions
concerning
sips
on
such
