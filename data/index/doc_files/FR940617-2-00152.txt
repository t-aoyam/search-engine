environmental
assessment
identification
of
proposed
action
the
proposed
action
would
revise
the
provisions
in
the
technical
specifications
(
ts
)
to
delete
the
area
critically
monitors
for
the
fuel
preparation
pool
,
spent
fuel
storage
pool
and
the
upper
containment
pools
.
the
proposed
action
is
in
accordance
with
the
licensees
application
for
amendment
dated
02/28/1992
.
the
need
for
the
proposed
action
the
proposed
amendment
is
needed
to
reflect
that
area
criticality
monitors
for
the
fuel
preparation
pool
,
spent
fuel
storage
pool
and
the
upper
containment
pools
are
monitors
only
and
do
not
prevent
inadvertent
criticality
and
are
not
considered
in
any
design
basis
accident
or
transient
.
therefore
,
these
monitors
can
be
adequately
controlled
by
plant
documents
and
procedures
similar
to
other
area
radiation
monitors
.
environmental
impact
of
the
proposed
action
the
nrc
staff
has
completed
its
evaluation
of
the
proposed
revision
to
the
ts
and
concludes
that
removing
the
area
criticality
monitors
from
ts
and
placing
operability
and
surveillance
requirements
in
plant
documents
and
procedures
will
not
increase
offsite
releases
.
these
monitors
are
not
relied
upon
to
successfully
mitigate
a
fuel
handling
accident
outside
of
containment
.
therefore
,
the
proposed
changes
do
not
increase
the
probability
or
consequences
of
accidents
,
no
changes
are
being
made
in
the
types
of
any
effluents
that
may
be
released
offsite
,
and
there
is
no
significant
increase
in
the
allowable
individual
or
cumulative
occupational
radiation
exposure
.
accordingly
,
the
nrc
staff
concludes
that
this
proposed
action
would
result
in
no
significant
radiological
environmental
impact
.
with
regard
to
potential
nonradiological
impacts
,
the
proposed
changes
to
the
ts
involve
systems
located
within
the
restricted
area
as
defined
in
10
cfr
part
20
.
it
does
not
affect
nonradiological
plant
effluents
and
has
no
other
environmental
impact
.
therefore
,
the
nrc
staff
concludes
that
there
are
no
significant
nonradiological
environmental
impacts
associated
with
the
proposed
amendment
.
alternative
to
the
proposed
action
because
the
commissions
staff
has
concluded
that
there
are
no
significant
environmental
impacts
associated
with
the
proposed
action
,
any
alternatives
would
have
either
no
significantly
different
environmental
impact
or
greater
environmental
impact
.
the
principal
alternative
would
be
to
deny
the
requested
amendment
.
this
would
not
reduce
environmental
impacts
as
a
result
of
plant
operations
.
alternative
use
of
resources
this
action
does
not
involve
the
use
of
resources
not
previously
considered
in
the
final
environmental
statement
related
to
operation
of
the
perry
nuclear
power
plant
,
units

and
2
,
dated

.
agencies
and
persons
consulted
the
nrc
staff
reviewed
the
licensees
request
and
consulted
with
the
state
of
ohio
.
finding
of
no
significant
impact
the
commission
has
determined
not
to
prepare
an
environmental
impact
statement
for
the
proposed
license
amendment
.
based
upon
the
foregoing
environmental
assessment
,
we
conclude
that
the
proposed
action
will
not
have
a
significant
effect
on
the
quality
of
the
human
environment
.
