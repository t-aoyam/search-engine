executive
order
12866
requires
that
a
regulatory
impact
analysis
be
prepared
for
any
regulation
that
meets
the
criteria
for
a
`
significant
regulatory
action
'
among
these
criteria
,
relevant
to
this
rulemaking
is
the
requirement
that
the
rule
have
an
annual
effect
on
the
economy
of
$
100

or
more

.
consistent
with
these
requirements
,
osha
has
made
a
determination
that
the
final
revised
standard
will
constitute
a
significant
regulatory
action
.
accordingly
,
osha
has
prepared
this
final
regulatory

regulatory

analysis
to
demonstrate
the
technological
and
economic
feasibility
of
the

asbestos
asbestos
is
the
generic
term
applied
to
a
group
of
naturallyoccurring
naturally

,
fibrous
silicates
characterized
by
high
tensile
strength
,
flexibility
,
and
resistance
to
thermal
,
chemical
,
and
electrical
conditions
.
according
to
the
bureau
of
mines
,
a
number
of
silicates
occur
naturally
in
fibrous
form
,
however
,
not
all
of
these
mineral
forms
are
labeled
asbestos
.
historically
,
only

such
that
the

asbestos
silicates
are
divided
into
two
mineral
groups
:
serpentine
and
amphiboles
.
both
groups
are
widely
distributed
in
the
earths
crust
in
many
igneous
and
metamorphic
rocks
.
in
rare
instances
,
these
mineral
deposits
contain
sufficient
quantities
of
usable
asbestiform
minerals
rendering
it
profitable
to
mine
for
commercial
asbestos
.
some
types
of
commercial
asbestos
have
the
properties
of
softness
,
silkiness
and
flexibility
that
,
among
other
uses
,
permits
them
to
be
spun
into
thread
from
which
cloth
can
be
woven
.
this
variety
,
found
in
the
serpentine
group
and
given
the
name
chrysotile
,
is
by
far
the
most
abundant
of
the
asbestos
minerals
,
comprising
over
90
percent
of
world
production
.

and

to
the
amphibole
group
and
,
unlike
the
serpentines
,
are
characterized
by
hard
and
brittle
fibers
.
chrysotile
,
amosite
,
and
crocidolite
all
have
extremely
high
tensile
strengths
and
have
been
used
extensively
as
reinforcers
in
cements
,
resins
,
and
plastics

in
the
production
process
,
asbestos
ore
is
mined
and
then
milled
to
achieve
a
homogeneous

graded
input
.
raw
asbestos
is
shipped
to
primary
industries
to
be
processed
into
intermediate
or
finished
products
.
for
some
goods
,
secondary
manufacturing
may
be
necessary
to
complete
the
production
process
.
the
finished

is
then
sold
to
construction
consumer
industries
for
application
,
installation
or
erection
without
further
modification
.

technically

with
