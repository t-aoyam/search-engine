as
part
of
maintenance
,
there
should
be
a
predictive
element
which
periodically
checks
the
hvac
system
to
evaluate
conformance
with
paragraph
(
d
.
this
check
should
conform
with
the
proposals
of
paragraph
(
d2
)
which
requires
an
inspection
and
maintenance
of
the
building
systems
.
this
periodic
visual
inspection
is
focused
by
the
checklist
outlined
in
paragraph
(
c
)
and
targets
those
components
that
directly
impact
indoor
air
quality
.
in
the
field
of
occupational
safety
and
health
,
as
practiced
by
industrial
hygienists
,
it
is
common
practice
to
perform
walkaround
walk
around
inspections
.
on
the
other
hand
,
the
hvac
industry
often
relies
heavily
on
remote
sensing
to
characterize
system
performance
.
therefore
,
this
required
visual
inspection
will
help
identify
those
deficiencies
that
would
otherwise
be
missed
,
such
as
microbial
contamination
in
cooling
coil
condensate
drip
pans
.
paragraph
(
d3
)
requires
that
the
facility
hvac
system
is
operating
during
all
workshifts
.
the
employer
must
provide
the
minimum
outside
ventilation
rate
for
contaminant
dilution
and
removal
whenever
the
building
is
occupied
and
used
.
osha
understands
that
the
minimum
outside
air
ventilation
rate
may
in
practice
only
be
provided
when
the
building
is
fully
occupied
or
utilized
.
it
is
not
uncommon
for
office
buildings
to
be
occupied
from
6
am
.
to
7
pm
.
to
accommodate
flexible
work
schedules
but
the
hvac
system
may
only
be
in
operation
from
8
am
.
to
5
pm
.
to
conserve
energy
.
the
technical
rationale
for
this
strategy
is
typically
based
on
the
recommendations
of
the
american
society
of
heating
,
refrigerating
and
airconditioning
air
conditioning
engineers
,

quality

section
6.1.3.4
and
appendix
`
g
'
of
ashrae
standard
621989
[
ex
.
4333
]
offers
a
rationale
for
the
lead
lag
operation
of
ventilation
systems
to
accommodate
transient
occupancy
.
the
basis
for
the
rationale
is
that
there
is
capacity
in
air
to
dilute
contaminants
if
the
space
has
been
previously
unoccupied
for
several
hours
.
this
strategy
,
however
,
applies
only
to
occupant
generated
contaminants
like
carbon
dioxide
and
odors
.
housekeeping
cleaning
agents
or
pesticides
are
typical
of
contaminants
that
may
be
released
which
could
not
be
absorbed
by
a
nonventilated
ventilated
space
.
consequently
,
other
contaminants
must
be
diluted
removed
by
the
ventilation
system
whenever
the
building
is
occupied
.
in
addition
,
it
is
recognized
that
certain
automatic
temperature
control
strategies
can
also
prevent
a
facility
from
receiving
the
minimum
outside
air
ventilation
rate
.
the
obvious
example
is
the
early
morning
warmup
warm
cycle
wherein
the
outside
air
dampers
are
kept
shut
in
the
morning
until
the
space
temperature
recovers
from
the
setback
temperature
of
the
night
before
.
these
energy
conservation
and
temperature
control
strategies
must
not
interfere
with
providing
minimum
outside
air
ventilation
when
the
building
is
occupied
.
paragraph
(

)
proposes
to
require
the
employer
to
utilize
general
or
local
exhaust
ventilation
,
as
provided
by
the
existing
hvac
system
or
auxiliary
systems
,
to
minimize
the
hazards
associated
with
maintenance
or
housekeeping
activities
.
the
literature
reports
iaq
bri
episodes
that
were
initiated
with
activities
like
painting
,
carpet
cleaning
and
floor
resurfacing
.
if
these
activities
occur
during
unoccupied
periods
then
chemical
vapors
from
paints
and
adhesives
and
excessive
moisture
from
carpet
cleaning
may
be
diluted
and
removed
by
the
outside
air
ventilation
function
of
the
hvac
system
.
during
occupied
periods
,
efforts
should
be
made
to
restrict
transportation
of
hazardous
contaminants
from
these
activities
throughout
the
facility
by
the
hvac

distribution
system

proposes
to

to
monitor
for
carbon

(

in
the
occupied
space
as

when

concentration

the

would
be
required
to
check
the
operation
of
the
hvac
system
.
co
is
frequently
used
as
a
gross
surrogate
indicator
of
indoor
air
quality
.
ideally
,
by
knowing
the
rate
of
accumulation
of
co
in

the
rate
of

,
it
would
be
possible
to
predict
the
rate
of
removal
of
co
from
the
space
by
the
hvac
system
.
because
buildings
have
average
occupant
densities
to
generate

,
,
the

is
an
indicator
of

to

however
,
the

ventilation
rate
offers
no
confidence
as
to
the
adequacy
of

removal
of

released

if
the

insufficient
to

,
then
it
can
be
assumed
that

also
be
elevated

that

proposes
to
require

to
restrict
the
presence

in

.
the
hvac

itself
should
not
be
the
source
of
hazardous
contaminants
due
to
its
'
critical
nature
as

if
