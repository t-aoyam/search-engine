the
following
sentence
is
added
to
the
end
of
the
paragraph
:
`
do
not
reuse
or
reload
cassettes
for
asbestos
sample
collection
'
the
practice
of
reusing
cassettes
can
result
in
lower
estimates
of
employee
exposure
.
adequate
cleaning
of
the
cassettes
cannot
be
assured
.
fibers
from
the
cassette
may
become
dislodged
and
be
collected
on
the
filter
during
subsequent
sampling
.
employee
exposure
assessments
are
often
assessed
based
on
a
small
number
of
fibers
.
this
is
because
it
is
not
possible
in
every
work
place
to
use
single
cassettes
for
an
entire
work
shift
due
to
excess
dust
in
the
air
.
this
is
significant
for
occupational
exposures
,
because
the
background
fiber
concentration
must
be
subtracted
from
the
compliance
sample
.
if
fugitive
fibers
from
used
cassettes
were
deposited
on
the
blank
filter
,
the
background
estimate
would
be
artificially
high
and
the
employee
exposure
will
be
underestimated
when
the
background
concentration
is
subtracted
as
required
.
elimination
of
the
practice
of
reusing
cassettes
will
eliminate
this
source
of
error
,
thereby
better
assessing
employee
exposure
.
a
requirement
that
cassette
reuse
not
be
allowed
is
added
to
the
end
of
paragraph
2
of
appendix
a
.
paragraph
11
is
revised
as
follows
:
11
.
each
set
of
samples
taken
will
include
10
%
field
blanks
or
a
minimum
of
2
field
blanks
.
these
blanks
must
come
from
the
same
lot
as
the
filters
used
for
sample
collection
.
the
field
blank
results
shall
be
averaged
and
subtracted
from
the
analytical
results
before
reporting
.
a
set
consists
of
any
sample
or
group
of
samples
for
which
an
evaluation
for
this
standard
must
be
made
.
any
samples
represented
by
a
field
blank
having
a
fiber
count
in
excess
of
the
detection
limit
of
the
method
being
used
shall
be
rejected
.
the
original
wording
of
the
standard
was
inadequate
to
apply
meaningfully
to
certain
sampling
practices
,
such
as
continuous
sampling
.
this
change
establishes
that
the
blanks
are
to
be
field
blanks
.
this
wording
also
establishes
when
blanks
are
to
be
taken
.
the
specific
practice
to
be
followed
for
blank
correction
is
outlined
in
appendix
b
,
the
detailed
analytical
method
.
each
time
an
evaluation
of
work
place
exposure
is
made
for
the
purposes
of
this
standard
,
the
samples
used
in
that
evaluation
must
be
represented
by
valid
blanks
taken
in
the
work
space
where
the
compliance
samples
were
taken
.
the
following
changes
apply
to
the
quality
control
section
.
paragraph
2
is
renumbered
2a
.
since
the
standard
was
promulgated
,
the
lack
of
a
specific
requirement
to
participate
the
program
for
analytical
testing
(
pat
)
has
led
to
confusion
with
the
requirement
that
laboratories
participate
in
a
round
robin
using
samples
taken
from
real
world
samples
.
a
second
paragraph
is
added
directly
following
2a
)
and
is
denoted
2b
.
2b
)
all
laboratories
should
participate
in
a
national
sample
testing
scheme
such
as
the
proficiency
analytical
testing
program
(
pat
,
the
asbestos
registry
sponsored
by
the
american
industrial
hygiene
association
(
aiha
.
this
is
a
requirement
of
osha
method
id160
and
niosh
7400
.
this
requirement
was
originally
left
out
of
the
standard
because
of
the
uncertain
status
of
the
pat
program
at
the
time
of
promulgation
of
the
standard
.
inclusion
at
this
time
is
to
make
it
clear
that
the
required
participation
in
a
round
robin
indicated
in
paragraph
2a
)
is
not
satisfied
by
participation
in
the
pat
program
.
such
participation
is
however
,
highly
desirable
and
may
be
required
for
private
accreditation
.
since
the
original
promulgation
of
the
asbestos
standards
,
there
have
been
several
improvements
and
refinements
to
the
analytical
procedure
.
two
major
analytical
methods
reflect
these
changes
and
continue
to
be
updated
as
necessary
.
the
changes
are
mostly
procedural
,
providing
safer
analysis
and
clearer
descriptions
of
the
procedures
that
are
to
be
carried
out
.
as
a
result
,
appendix
a
and
appendix
b
have
been
updated
to
reflect
the
most
recent
refinements
.
changes
to
the
mandatory
asbestos
method
appendix
a
are
intended
to
clarify
some
of
the
requirements
of
the
method
.
wording
has
been
inserted
to
indicate
what
methods
are
acceptable
.
a
definition
of
what
constitutes
a
`
set
'
of
asbestos
samples
was
added
to
more
clearly
define
when
blank
samples
are
to
be
taken
and
to
reinforce
that
they
are
to
be
field
samples
.
paragraph
11
is
amended
to
clarify
what
a
set
of
samples
is
and
when
it
is
necessary
to
take
blank
samples
.
an
early
draft
version
of
niosh
method
7400
was
used
for
the
model
of
appendix
b
.
there
were
several
problems
with
the
method
including
the
potentially
dangerous
practice
of
boiling
acetone
.
this
appendix
has
been
replaced
entirely
with
the
most
current
version
of
osha
method
id160
asbestos
in
air
.
the
osha
id160
give
the
same
results
as
niosh
7400
when
used
within
the
sampling
constraints
imposed
by
appendix
a
,
notably
the
flow
rate
limits
of
between
05
and
5
liters
per
minute
for
the
25
mm
cassette
and
1
to
5
for
the
37
mm
cassette
.
the
counting
rules
are
functionally
the
same
for
both
methods
.
use
of
appendix
b
,
osha
id160
or
niosh
method
7400
when
used
within
the
constraints
of
appendix
a
are
all
acceptable
and
equivalent
.
appendix
b
is
the
same
as
osha
method
id160
on
the
date
of
publication
of
these
changes
.
it
,
like
niosh
method
7400
,
is
subject
to
change
when
such
changes
will
result
in
better
methodology
.
as
the
pel
has
been
lowered
to
01
fiber
cc
,
there
is
an
increased
concern
about
sample
overloading
as
voiced
by
several
commentors
such
as
the
american
industrial
hygiene
association
(
aiha
.
such
overloading
is
the
presence
of
nonasbestos
asbestos
dust
on
the
surface
of
the
filter
obscuring
the
filter
surface
.
such
dust
has
been
shown
to
decrease
the
number
of
fibers
counted
even
before
the
surface
is
fully
obscured
.
some
employers
have
taken
samples
in
such
a
way
that
there
are
no
representative
samples
for
the
work
being
performed
because
all
of
the
filters
have
been
obscured
by
excess
dust
.
the
intention
of
appendix
a
is
to
provide
for
the
most
precise
measurement
possible
while
allowing
for
the
fact
that
many
work
places
have
an
exceeding
amount
of
nonasbestos
asbestos
dust
.
appendix
a
suggests
that
a
sample
be
collected
such
that
there
are
a
minimum
of
100
fibers
mm2
.
in
many
work
places
this
is
not
possible
.
it
is
preferable
to
collect
a
sample
that
can
be
used
to
estimate
the
asbestos
concentration
even
if
it
is
with
a
higher
than
ideal
error
level
than
it
is
to
collect
a
large
volume
and
completely
obscure
the
filter
rendering
the
sample
useless
.
an
acceptable
weight
of
dust
on
the
filter
is
highly
dependent
on
the
average
particle
size
of
the
dust
.
very
small
particles
such
as
those
from
diesel
exhaust
will
quickly
obscure
the
filter
with
very
little
weight
(
much
less
than
1
mg
on
the
filter
.
on
the
other
hand
,
large
particles
may
load
the
weight
up
beyond
several
milligrams
with
little
loss
in
fiber
count
.
for
5
micrometer
diameter
particles
with
a
density
of
3
,
25
%
of
the
filter
area
will
be
obscured
with
a
total
weight
on
the
filter
of
1mg
.
increasing
the
average
diameter
of
the
particles
to
10
micrometers
will
double
the
allowable
weight
to
2mg
.
it
is
very
important
for
the
person
conducting
sampling
to
be
careful
about
the
dust
levels
in
the
air
.
it
is
acceptable
to
take
a
series
of
samples
to
model
the
work
place
air
when
serial
sampling
will
result
in
samples
that
can
be
used
.
serial
sampling
has
the
additional
benefit
that
higher
asbestos
concentrations
can
be
measured
by
reducing
the
volume
of
air
drawn
through
each
filter
.
appendix
g
osha
is
removing
appendix
g
from
the
construction
standard
.
the
rulemaking
proceeding
and
the
agencys
experience
enforcing
the
unrevised
standard
showed
that
this
`
nonmandatory
non
mandatory
'
appendix
was
unclear
and
that
portions
of
it
belonged
in
the
regulatory
text
.
former
appendix
g
covered
controls
for
all
four
classes
of
asbestos
work
.
therefore
,
osha
has
extracted
the
main
provisions
covering
various
controls
and
practices
required
for
each
class
and
placed
them
as
discussed
in
the
regulatory
text
applying
to
each
operation
covered
.
