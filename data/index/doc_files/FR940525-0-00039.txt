electronic
submission
comment
:
a
few
commenters
requested
clarification
concerning
the
format
for
electronic
reporting
.
response
:
hcfa
provided
approved
vendors
of
cost
reporting
software
with
a
uniform
standardized
format
for
the
creation
of
the
required
ascii
file
.
this
format
shows
how
each
unique
record
must
be
displayed
in
the
electronic
file
in
terms
of
worksheet
,
line
,
and
column
position
.
the
specifications
required
to
complete
a
computerized
medicare
cost
report
have
been
in
effect
since
the
inception
of
the
automated
desk
review
(
adr
)
program
in
1983
.
there
are
presently
three
vendors
approved
by
hcfa
for
the
adr
system
.
eight
other
commercial
vendors
are
approved
by
hcfa
for
electronic
compilation
of
the
medicare
cost
report
.
a
hospital
may
use
any
of
the
11
vendors
for
purposes
of
filing
an
electronically
prepared
cost
report
.
each
of
the
11
vendors
must
undergo
periodic
testing
in
which
it
develops
and
submits
to
hcfa
a
completed
cost
report
to
demonstrate
its
systems
ability
to
conform
to
hcfas
display
standards
.
no
hospital
may
file
its
cost
report
electronically
unless
the
commercial
software
system
it
uses
has
completed
the
testing
process
and
been
approved
by
hcfa
.
in
addition
,
when
the
provider
files
the
cost
report
with
the
intermediary
,
the
cost
report
must
pass
edits
specified
in
the
provider
reimbursement
manual
,
part
ii
,
before
the
intermediary
can
accept
it
.
if
the
cost
report
fails
to
pass
these
edits
the
intermediary
will
immediately
reject
the
cost
report
and
return
it
to
the
provider
for
correction
.
the
cost
report
will
be
considered
late
if
the
provider
fails
to
correct
it
before
the
due
date
.
the
provider
will
be
subject
to
withholding
of
interim
payments
until
the
intermediary
receives
the
corrected
cost
report
.
comment
:
several
commenters
questioned
the
need
to
file
a
hard
copy
cost
report
in
addition
to
submitting
the
electronic
cost
report
.
additionally
,
commenters
were
concerned
with
the
lack
of
a
written
statement
certifying
the
accuracy
of
the
electronic
cost
report
.
one
commenter
suggested
that
hcfa
require
providers
to
submit
a
written
certification
with
the
electronic
cost
report
.
response
:
we
agree
with
the
commenters
concerns
regarding
the
need
to
file
a
hard
copy
cost
report
and
the
lack
of
a
statement
certifying
the
accuracy
of
the
electronic
file
.
therefore
,
effective
for
cost
reporting
periods
ending
on
or
after
10/01/1994
,
we
are
eliminating
the
requirement
that
providers
file
a
hard
copy
of
the
cost
report
in
addition
to
the
electronic
file
.
in
new
§
413
24
,
we
specify
that
instead
of
a
hard
copy
cost
report
,
providers
must
submit
a
hard
copy
of
the
certification
statement
,
settlement
summary
,
and
a
statement
of
certain
worksheet
totals
found
within
the
cost
report
file
.
we
note
that
the
certification
statement
provides
that
in
signing
the
statement
,
the
providers
administrator
or
chief
financial
officer
is
certifying
the
accuracy
of
the
data
contained
in
the
electronic
cost
report
or
,
if
the
provider
has
filed
a
manually
prepared
report
,
in
the
hard
copy
cost
report
.
we
believe
that
these
changes
will
reduce
the
burden
on
providers
and
ensure
the
accuracy
of
the
data
contained
in
the
electronic
file
.
however
,
we
also
need
to
ensure
that
the
electronic
cost
report
is
not
altered
once
it
leaves
the
provider
.
thus
,
in
conjunction
with
the
changes
made
based
on
public
comment
,
we
are
implementing
a
series
of
changes
designed
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
electronic
cost
report
once
the
provider
files
it
with
the
intermediary
.
first
,
we
are
specifying
in
new
§
413
24
)
that
the
providers
software
must
be
capable
of
disclosing
that
changes
have
been
made
to
the
cost
report
file
after
the
provider
has
submitted
it
to
the
intermediary
.
specifically
,
electronic
cost
reporting
software
will
be
modified
so
that
the
cost
report
will
calculate
a
`
hash
total
,
that
is
,
a
number
representing
the
sum
of
the
worksheet
totals
(
mentioned
above
)
contained
in
the
providers
as
filed
cost
report
.
if
any
data
in
the
electronic
file
is
changed
after
the
hash
total
is
calculated
,
the
electronic
file
will
disclose
that
a
change
has
been
made
.
we
will
instruct
all
automated
data
reporting
vendors
to
develop
the
capability
to
calculate
hash
totals
and
disclose
changes
for
all
their
provider
clients
.
second
,
we
are
specifying
in
regulations
that
an
intermediary
may
not
alter
a
cost
report
once
it
has
been
filed
by
a
hospital
and
must
reject
any
cost
report
that
does
not
pass
all
specified
edits
and
return
it
to
the
provider
for
correction
.
third
,
hcfa
will
make
periodic
checks
to
ensure
that
the
totals
in
the
electronic
file
agree
with
those
totals
certified
by
the
providers
administrator
or
chief
financial
officer
.
because
providers
may
not
have
anticipated
such
substantial
changes
as
a
result
of
this
rule
,
we
are
soliciting
comments
concerning
the
requirement
in
new
§
413
24
)
that
cost
report
software
be
able
to
disclose
changes
to
the
electronic
file
made
after
the
provider
has
submitted
it
to
the
intermediary
.
comment
:
one
commenter
requested
that
the
intermediary
be
required
to
report
back
to
the
provider
in
electronic
cost
reporting
format
the
audit
adjustments
made
to
the
providers
cost
report
.
this
would
allow
providers
to
readily
add
the
audit
adjustments
to
the
electronic
cost
report
for
future
reference
.
response
:
we
recognize
the
merit
of
this
suggestion
and
will
consider
implementing
this
process
in
the
future
.
the
intermediaries
would
need
additional
computer
programming
to
be
able
to
provide
hospitals
with
an
electronic
file
of
audit
adjustments
.
we
will
discuss
the
commenters
suggestion
with
the
11
approved
vendors
of
cost
report
software
to
determine
the
extent
of
additional
programming
needed
and
the
financial
implications
.
