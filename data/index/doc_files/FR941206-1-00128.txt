reason
for
action
.
the
cable
television
consumer
protection
and
completion
act
of
1992
requires
the
commission
to
prescribe
rules
and
regulations
for
determining
reasonable
rates
for
basic
tier
cable
service
and
to
establish
criteria
for
identifying
unreasonable
rates
for
cable
programming
services
.
the
commissions
existing
rate
regulations
permit
operators
to
pass
through
to
subscribes
the
costs
of
obtaining
programming
plus
a
75
%
markup
mark
on
new
programming
costs
.
the
revised
rules
,
adopted
pursuant
to
the
sixth
order
on
reconsideration
and
fifth
report
and
order
,
permit
operators
to
use
a
new
per
channel
adjustment
methodology
for
channels
added
on
or
after
05/15/1994
,
and
to
eliminate
the
75
%
markup
mark
on
new
programming
costs
for
those
channels
.
this
notice
proposes
to
determine
extent
to
which
cable
operators
electing
to
use
either
the
existing
or
the
new
going
forward
rules
,
can
continue
to
pass
through
to
subscribers
a
75
%
markup
mark
on
increases
