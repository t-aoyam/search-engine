other
considerations
in
addition
to
establishing
emission
limits
and
work
practice
standards
for
the
industry
,
several
members
of
the
committee
were
also
interested
in
establishing
a
mechanism
for
tracking
the
impact
of
the
standards
on
emissions
of
hap
and
other
pollutants
,
collecting
information
on
technologies
being
used
to
meet
the
standards
,
and
providing
a
forum
for
dissemination
of
information
on
evolving
technologies
.
the
committee
members
felt
that
it
was
important
to
verify
the
proposed
standards
were
achieving
the
reductions
in
emissions
and
hazards
that
were
expected
and
to
provide
information
on
the
technologies
and
substances
being
used
to
achieve
those
reductions
.
because
the
emission
limits
for
finishing
materials
can
be
met
through
substitution
of
nonhap
hap
vocs
for
hap
,
and
some
nonhaps
haps
can
be
as
hazardous
as
the
listed
haps
,
they
felt
it
was
important
to
track
emissions
of
other
pollutants
from
the
industry
to
ensure
that
materials
of
equal
or
greater
toxicity
were
not
being
substituted
for
hap
,
and
that
appropriate
action
would
be
taken
if
this
should
occur
.
throughout
the
regulatory
negotiation
,
there
was
discussion
of
new
,
lower
emitting
(
both
voc
and
hap
)
technologies
that
are
reportedly
on
the
threshold
of
demonstration
.
the
committee
members
felt
that
as
these
technologies
are
demonstrated
,
the
information
should
be
made
available
to
the
public
.
after
some
discussion
among
committee
members
concerning
the
logistics
of
collecting
and
disseminating
the
information
,
the
committee
decided
that
the
preamble
to
the
neshap
should
call
for
a
trends
report
.
the
report
would
be
developed
by
the
industry
.
the
report
would
be
made
available
to
the
epa
,
who
would
disseminate
it
to
all
interested
parties
.
in
compiling
a
trends
report
,
the
committee
agreed
that
industry
will
survey
a
sample
of
the
industry
that
is
determined
to
be
representative
of
the
entire
industry
.
this
industrycollected
industry
collected
data
will
initially
establish
a
baseline
for
this
report
and
will
,
in
subsequent
years
,
be
used
to
determine
whether
there
have
been
increases
and
or
decreases
in
overall
industry
use
of
vhaps
and
vocs
,
and
will
include
data
on
increases
and
or
decreases
in
the
use
of
individual
vhaps
or
vocs
.
individual
facility
or
company
data
would
be
collected
and
assembled
by
industry
sources
.
as
the
individual
data
submissions
will
reflect
confidential
business
practices
and
or
trade
secrets
,
such
individual
submissions
are
prohibited
from
public
disclosure
except
pursuant
to
court
order
or
other
legal
requirement
.
this
agreement
to
compile
a
trends
report
begins
with
the
report
submitted
for
the
baseline
year
,
1994
,
which
industry
will
compile
and
submit
to
the
agency
in
1995
.
reports
thereafter
will
be
compiled
every
2
years
,
beginning
with
a
trends
report
for
1996
.
this
agreement
to
submit
a
trends
report
will
terminate
1
year
after
epa
is
required
to
complete
the
review
of
this
standard
prescribed
by
42
usc
.
section
7412f2
,
which
mandates
epa
to
review
neshap
for
residual
risk
.
in
addition
to
the
above
data
,
the
committee
agreed
that
the
trends
report
would
include
a
brief
discussion
of
technologies
being
used
by
the
industry
to
reduce
emissions
,
and
a
discussion
of
evolving
technologies
including
new
finishing
materials
,
adhesives
,
and
improved
application
equipment
.
this
discussion
would
not
be
an
attempt
to
explain
the
emission
trends
,
but
rather
it
would
be
an
independent
review
from
industry
experts
on
new
technologies
that
are
coming
into
increased
use
or
that
may
be
developing
.
the
committee
also
recommended
a
working
group
be
formed
from
interested
committee
members
to
provide
further
input
on
the
details
of
the
scope
of
the
report
