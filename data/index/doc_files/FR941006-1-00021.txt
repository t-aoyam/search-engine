as
of
03/01/1994
,
these
forms
were
being
processed
by
the
departments
central
processing
facility
.
approximately
85
percent
of
reporting
agencies
(
3655
has
)
are
submitting
paper
forms
.
this
extensive
processing
of
paper
forms
has
become
a
burden
to
the
has
as
well
as
to
hud
.
to
reduce
the
cost
to
the
department
of
processing
this
information
and
to
improve
its
accuracy
,
the
department
is
issuing
this
proposed
rule
to
require
that
the
information
be
submitted
electronically
.
the
change
is
expected
to
contribute
significant
savings
to
the
department
,
in
a
time
when
budget
contraints
demand
such
savings
.
housing
agencies
that
report
on
paper
have
the
time
consuming
task
of
completing
the
calculations
which
are
prone
to
error
.
the
department
edits
the
information
on
the
forms
.
when
errors
are
found
,
has
are
notified
(
by
letter
)
and
requested
to
make
appropriate
corrections
.
the
time
spent
by
has
in
initiating
electronic
transmission
and
making
corrections
to
the
electronic
data
submissions
will
be
offset
by
future
savings
in
the
reexamination
and
reporting
process
,
as
well
as
increased
accuracy
and
speed
associated
with
the
admission
,
reexamination
and
reporting
processes
,
and
the
reduced
number
of
hud
adjustments
and
paperwork
required
by
these
adjustments
.
this
change
to
electronic
submission
of
family
data
will
also
encourage
has
to
automate
other
functions
or
to
automate
this
particular
function
as
they
automate
others
,
in
the
course
of
revising
their
own
management
practices
.
the
rule
will
require
has
to
submit
data
electronically
via
telephone
modem
,
rather
than
through
tape
,
diskette
,
or
paper
.
however
,
the
rule
also
provides
that
the
department
may
approve
transmission
of
the
data
by
tape
or
diskette
where
the
department
determines
that
the
cost
of
telephonic
transmission
would
be
excessive
.
(
it
is
contemplated
that
this
would
only
occur
in
a
few
instances
,
involving
very
large

)
b
.
voluntary
automation
several
years
ago
,
the
department
began
to
develop
a
computer
system
to
collect
all
rental
assistance
data
and
ensure
the
accuracy
of
subsidy
payments
.
this
system
serves
as
the
basis
for
the
departments
electronic
data
transmission
requirements
in
lieu
of
hard
copy
.
in
07/19/1993
,
the
department
distributed
a
form
hud50058
hud
information
packet
,
which
gave
instructions
for
submitting
the
data
electronically
.
the
department
encouraged
program
participants
to
begin
transmitting
data
electronically
to
hud
(
via
tape
,
diskette
,
or
telephonic
network
.
approximately
600
housing
agencies
have
responded
by
submitting
the
data
electronically
.
recently
,
the
department
initiated
a
pilot
test
with
20
has
using
the
telephonic
network
mode
(
via
sprintmaila
commercial
software
package
)
to
evaluate
ha
capability
for
data
transmission
.
in
addition
,
a
test
program
(
for
use
by
all
has
)
has
been
initiated
to
assure
that
errors
are
not
introduced
by
the
senders
software
.
both
processes
will
facilitate
implementation
of
this
rule
.
these
electronic
transmissions
consist
of
information
requested
on
the
forms
,
organized
into
various
categories
and
transmitted
in
an
ascii
fixed
format
(
not
field
delimited
.
these
fixed
format
ascii
files
will
deliver
the
data
with
the
field
lengths
as
specified
by
hud
in
the
07/19/1993
guide
.
(
this
guide
may
be
obtained
from
the
office
listed
above
for
program
information
)
the
department
encourages
has
to
begin
electronic
transmission
as
soon
as
the
capability
exists
.
an
earlier
electronic
transmission
will
allow
timely
correction
of
errors
found
during
the
data
load
into
the
automated
software
.
these
corrections
will
then
reduce
the
number
of
errors
formerly
found
when
manual
information
entered
the
departments
system
.
early
electronic
transmission
will
also
help
minimize
an
initial
surge
of
data
in
the
system
from
the
number
of
currently
nonautomated

.
c

has
(
ie
.
those
who
currently
prepare
the
forms
hud50058
hud
and
hud50058fss
hud
manually
)
should
immediately
begin
to
obtain
information
on
the
cost
of
purchasing
hardware
or
software
,
or
both
,
to
determine
whether
it
is
financially
feasible
to
purchase
these
items
or
whether
they
should
contract
out
the
electronic
transmission
of
data
to
another
entity
.
these
has
must
:
(
1
)
complete
the
search
and
either
purchase
the
necessary
hardware
and
software
,
or
sign

contracts
,
(
2
)
complete
their
data
loading
,
and
(
3
)
begin
electronic
transmission
by
one
year
after
the
publication
of
the
final
rule
.
