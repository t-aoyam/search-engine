the

the

(

the

the

these

have
been
reasonably
well
established
for
the
human
[

and
the
chief
effort
associated
with
pharmacokinetic
model
parameterization
in
the
human
is
the
determination
of
the
necessary
level
of
detail
for
the
physiological
description
,
grouping
of

not

a
separate
description
into

similar
groups

the

of
the

volume
and

data
with
the
selected
groupings
.
existing
models
for
nicotine
and
cotinine
contain
a
fairly
detailed
physiological
structure
and
differ
only
slightly
in
their
assignment
of
tissues
.
the
model
of
plowchalk
and
debethizy
[
ex
.
4254
]
includes
separate
compartments
for
the
brain
,
heart
,
and
skin
.
the
first
two
of
these
tissues
are
lumped
into
a

vesselrich

rich
'
tissue
compartment
in
the
model
of
robinson
et

.
[

,
and
the
skin
is
lumped
in
with
the
muscle
.
conversely
,
the
gastrointestinal
tract
is
given
a
separate
compartment
in
the
robinson
model
but
is
lumped
into
a
`
slowly
perfused
'
tissue
compartment
in
the
plowchalk
model
.
these
differences
mainly
reflect
the
different
interests
of
the
modeling
groups
in
terms
of
target
organs
and
routes
of
exposure
.
the
robinson
model
contains
a
venous
infusion
compartment
to
accommodate
the
mixing
time
for
arterial
administration
.
the
published
plowchalk
model
does
not
include
this
feature
,
but
a
forearm
compartment
has
since
been
added
to
provide
a
similar
function
[

neither
model
appears
to
contain
an
explicit
description
of
inhalation
or
oral
exposure
,
but
the
necessary
equations
could
easily
be
added
to
the
existing
physiological
structures
.
a
salivary
fluid
compartment
could
also
be
added
to
either
model
if
desired
.
experience
with
other
chemicals
has
shown
that
uncertainty
in
the
physiological
parameters
generally
has
much
less
impact
on
overall
model
uncertainty
because
they
are
known
relatively
well
and
are
not
as
influential
on
model
behavior
as
the
distribution
and
kinetic
parameters

distributional

in
both
of
the
published
human
models
,
the
tissue
partitioning
was
initially
estimated
on
the
basis
of
steadystate
steady
state
tissue
blood
concentration
ratios
measured
in
animals
.
the
partitioning
parameters
in
the
robinson
model
were
then
iteratively
adjusted
to
fit
other
timecourse
data
.
the
resulting
partition
coefficients
in
the
two
models
differ
by
a
factor
from
two
to
five
in
corresponding
tissues
.
the
partitioning
data
for
cotinine
,
determined
by
gabrelsson
and
bondesson
[
ex

4112
,
show
a
similar
level
of
uncertainty
;
partitions
for
cotinine
following
infusion
of
nicotine
were
two
-
to
fivefold
five
fold
higher
than
the
same
partitions
following
infusion
of
cotinine
.
the
lack
of
reproducibility
of
these
data
represents
a
deficiency
in
the
development
of
pbpk
modeling
for
these
chemicals
.
fortunately
,
the
partition
coefficients
tend
to
be
less
important
than
the
kinetic
parameters
in
terms
of
overall
model
performance
.
to
a
large
extent
,
as
long
as
the
volume
of
distribution
associated
with
the
physiological
structure
and
partition
coefficients
is
in
agreement
with
the
apparent
pharmacokinetic
volume
of
distribution
for
each
chemical
,
the
model
will
perform
adequately
in
terms
of
timecourses
in
blood
and
urine
.
this
was
evidenced
by
the
ability
of
the
robinson
model
to
reproduce
published
nicotine
and
cotinine
pharmacokinetic
data
[
ex

4270

a
potentially
more
significant
uncertainty
associated
with
distribution
is
the
possibility
of

significant
tissue
binding
of

clearly
,
the
relatively
low
capacity
,
high
affinity
binding
associated
with
nicotine
is
unlikely
to
effect

except
at

however
,
the
existence
of

pharmacokinetics
at

lead
to
a
miscalculation
of

for

for

and
therefore
cotinine

associated

that
this

is
due
to
the

of

to
