the

in

and
transfer
all
such

to

.
osha
reaffirms
its
finding
of
the
1986
standard
that
an
employees
presence
in
the
workplace
places
him
at
increased
risk
from
asbestos
exposure
regardless
of
whether
he
she
is
actually
working
with
asbestos
or
is
just
in
the
vicinity
of
such
material
.
osha
has
defined
`
building
owner
'
to
include
these
lessees
who
control
the
management
and
recordkeeping
functions
of
a
building
/
facility
vessel
.
it
is
not
oshas
intention
to
exempt
the
owner
from
notification
requirements
by
allowing
a
lessee
to
comply
.
rather
when
the
owner
has
transferred
the
management
of
the
building
to
a
longterm
long
term
lessee
,
that
lessee
is
the
more
appropriate
party
to
receive
,
transmit
,
and
retain
information
about
inplace
in
place
asbestos
.
when
a
lease
has
expired
,
any
records
in
the
lessees
possession
must
be
transferred
to
the
owner
or
the
subsequent
lessee
exercising
similar
managerial
authority
.
the
expanded
notification
provisions
also
require
that
on
multiemployer
employer
worksites
,
any
employer
planning
to
perform
work
which
will
be
in
a
regulated
area
,
before
starting
,
must
notify
the
building
owner
of
the
location
of
the
acm
and
the
protective
measures
taken
;
upon
discovering
unexpected
acm
,
they
must
provide
similar
notification
;
and
,
upon
work
completion
they
must
provide
to
the
owner
a
written
record
of
the
remaining
acm
at
the
site
.
osha
has
included
a
provision
that
within
10
days
of
the
completion
of
class
i
or
ii
asbestos
work
,
the
employer
of
the
employees
who
performed
the
work
shall
inform
the
owner
and
employers
of
employees
who
will
be
working
in
the
area
of
the
current
location
and
quantity
of
pacm
and
or
acm
remaining
in
the
former
regulated
area
and
shall
also
inform
him
her
of
the
final
monitoring
results
taken
in
that
operation
.
osha
has
determined
that
the
employer
of
employees
reoccupying
the
area
must
have
this
information
in
order
to
provide
the
appropriate
protection
to
his
her
workers
.
to
provide
effective
notification
in
class
iii
asbestos
operations
,
osha
is
building
upon
its
earlier
requirement
to
post
warning
signs
in
regulated
areas
.
now
since
all
class
iii
work
must
be
conducted
in
a
regulated
area
all
maintenancetype
maintenance
type
operations
will
be
posted
with
signs
,
which
state
the
fact
that
asbestos
exposing
activities
are
present
.
osha
considers
site
posting
to
be
a
particularly
effective
means
to
alert
employees
of
hazardous
areas
where
relatively
shortterm
short
term
repair
and
maintenance
activities
are
taking
place
.
osha
believes
that
site
posting
will
adequately
notify
potentially
affected
employees
who
are
not
working
on
the
operation
,
but
are
working
within
the
area
or
adjacent
to
it
.
identification
of
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
materials
in
buildings
and
facilities
in
addition
to
the
`
notification
'
issues
just
discussed
,
osha
addresses
a
related
widespread
concern
expressed
by
participants
in
this
rulemaking
:
how
to
ensure
that
workers
in
buildings
and
facilities
with
previously
installed
asbestos
containing
products
,
are
not
exposed
to
asbestos
fibers
merely
because
they
have
no
knowledge
of
where
such
products
were
installed
.
osha
has
found
that
such
workers
,
primarily
maintenance
workers
and
custodians
,
but
also
contract
workers
such
as
plumbers
,
carpenters
and
sheet
metal
workers
and
workers
in
industrial
facilities
have
shown
historic
disease
patterns
which
in
large
part
resulted
from
exposure
to
previously
installed
asbestos
.
(
see
discussions
elsewhere
in
this
preamble
of
data
submitted
by
bctd
,
afscme
,
seiu
and
others
.
in
its
1990
proposal
osha
raised
the
issue
of
how
to
identify
previously
installed
asbestos
and
asked
for
comments
and
recommendations
(
55
fr
29730
.
osha
opened
the
record
for
supplemental
comments
in
11/19/1992
,
in
a
notice
which
also
set
out
oshas
preliminary
views
on
how
to
effectively
protect
workers
from
unknowing
exposure
to
previously
installed
acm
(
57
fr
49657
.
there
,
osha
proposed
to
require
employers
to
presumptively
identify
certain
widely
prevalent
and
more
risky
materials
.
these
are
thermal
system
insulation
,
and
sprayedon
sprayed
on
and
troweledon
troweled
on
surfacing
materials
,
in
buildings
built
between
1920
and
1980
.
these
materials
were
to
be
termed
`
presumed
asbestos
containing
materials
'
(
pacm
)
and
were
to
be
treated
as
asbestos
containing
for
all
purposes
of
the
standard
.
osha
would
have
allowed
building
owners
and
employers
to
rebut
these
presumptions
using
building
records
and
or
bulk
sampling
.
the
final
provisions
which
are
included
in
all
three
standards
,
like
oshas
1992
approach
,
require
building
owners
and
employers
to
presume
that
thermal
system
insulation
(
tsi
)
and
sprayedon
sprayed
on
and
troweledon
troweled
on
surfacing
materials
contain
asbestos
,
unless
rebutted
pursuant
to
the
criteria
in
the
standard
.
additionally
,
osha
is
requiring
in
its
mandatory
work
practices
for
flooring
material
containing
asbestos
,
that
employers
assume
that
resilient
flooring
material
consisting
of
vinyl
sheeting
,
and
vinyl
and
asphalt
containing
tile
installed
before
1980
also
be
presumed
to
contain
asbestos
(
see
discussion
in
the
`
methods
of
compliance
'
section
.
unlike
the
proposal
,
buildings
constructed
before
1920
are
not
excluded
from
these
requirements
.
also
rebuttal
criteria
have
been
changed
.
unlike
the
approach
osha
suggested
in
the
11/19/1992
notice
,
building
records
may
not
be
relied
upon
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
asbestos
containing
material
and
more
detailed
instructions
are
supplied
for
the
inspection
process
.
osha
believes
that
these
provisions
will
protect
employees
in
buildings
and
facilities
from
the
consequences
of
unknowing
significant
exposure
to
asbestos
in
the
most
costeffective
cost
effective
manner
.
