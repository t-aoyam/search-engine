the
national
automobile
dealers
association
(

)
agreed
in
its
posthearing
hearing
comment
that
the
use
of
spray
can
with
certain
solvents
is
potentially
dangerous
,
and
suggested
that
nonhazardous
sprays
or
aerosols
be
allowed
(
ex

.
another
participant
described
an
occasion
in
which
the
spray
can
was
accidentally
dropped
,
punctured
,
and
released
solvent
into
the
work
area
(

the
safety
director
at
fruehauf
trailer
operations
,
asked
`
why
is
it
necessary
to
use
a
solvent
as
opposed
to
water
?
*
*
*
*
*
*
why
couldnt
it
be
used
in
place
of
a
solvent
in
the
performance
of
brake
and
clutch
work
'

mr

swartz
agreed
that
`
simple
water
and
detergent
can
be
as
effective
'
(
ex

)
however
,
he
insisted
that
it
be
a
gentle
mist
of
water
and
that
resulting
drips
be
caught
and
proper
disposal
carried
out
(

osha
agrees
with
these
comments
and
witnesses
.
the
agency
notes
that
some
of
the
solvents
contained
in
the
spray
cans
used
to
spray
brake
assemblies
present
significant
health
risks
.
as
a
matter
of
public
health
policy
,
it
is
better
not
to
list
as
preferred
,
a
compliance
method
which
introduces
another
hazardous
substance
into
the
breathing
zone
of
the
worker
.
further
,
the
effectiveness
of
the
solvent
spray
method
is
compromised
by
the
reported
need
to
use
additional
force
to
remove
asbestos
deposited
in
the
brake
assembly
,
which
the
spray
cannot
reach
.
additionally
,
comment
and
testimony
indicate
that
the
force
of
the
aerosol
spray
by
itself
can
make
airborne
the
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
dust
.
osha
noted
in
the
proposal
,
that
the
spray
solvent
can
method
produced
the
highest
airborne
concentrations
of
the
methods
tested
by
niosh
(

at

.
osha
notes
that
although
it
based
its
endorsement
of
the
solvent
spray
method
on
the
niosh
study
,
as
mr
.
swartz
pointed
out
,
`
the
issue
of
the
residual
dust
left
in

dont

was
properly
addressed
in
that

(

thus
,
in
this
final
standard
the
spray
solvent
can
method
is
no
longer
a
`
preferred
method
'
the
use
of
which
will
exempt
employers
from
other
provisions
of
the
standard
.
although
the
standard
does
not
prohibit
the
use
of
solvent
sprays
in
brake
and
clutch
repair
to
control
asbestos
exposure
,
employers
will
have
to
comply
with
other
provisions
in
the
asbestos
and
other
standards
when
using
the
method
.
initial
monitoring
must
be
undertaken
to
assure
that
exposures
are
likely
to
remain
under
the
pel
,
provisions
of
the
hazard
communication
standard
relating
to
communicating
the
hazard
potential
of
the
solvent
used
,
and
training
employees
in
avoiding
exposure
to
such
solvent
must
be
complied
with
.
employees
must
be
specifically
informed
that
the
solvent
spray
method
is
not
preferred
,
and
oshas
reasons
for
that
decision
must
be
explained
to
them
,
as
part
of
that
training
.
employers
must
provide
for
the
prompt
cleanup
of
all
asbestos
containing
liquid
or
debris
which
is
produced
by
any
brake
cleaning
method
,
including
a
solvent
spray
.
thus
,
solventwetted
solvent
wetted
asbestos
containing
material
must
be
hepa
vacuumed
when
it
reaches
the
ground
,
because
waiting
will
result
in
dried
and
airborne
dust
.
among
the
methods
tested
by
niosh
was
the
use
of
a
hepa
vacuum
alone
,
without
enclosure
.
the
national
automobile
dealers
association
representative
,
d
.
greenhaus
,
encouraged
osha
to
include
this
in
its
list
of
preferred
methods
of
asbestos
control
in
brake
work
stating
that
this
was
the
method
already
in
use
in
many
places
(
ex
.
7104
.
the
sheehy
(
niosh
)
study
noted
that
'
*
*
*
*
*
*
the
drums
must
be
removed
before
the
vacuum
cleaner
can
be
used
,
thus
there
is
a
potential
for
asbestos
release
during
drum
removal
'
(
ex
.
1112
,
and
p
.
carpenter
of
nilfisk
stated
`
the
greatest
potential
for
exposure
occurs
when
the
brake
drum
is
first
removed
'
(
ex
.
7140
.
osha
agrees
that
the
potential
for
exposure
during
drum
removal
before
the
hepa
vacuum
can
be
used
precludes
listing
including
this
as
a
preferred
method
.
moreover
,
niosh
found
that
hepa
systems
alone
do
not
clean
the
brake
components
as
effectively
as
the
other
methods
(
ex
.
1112
.
mr
.
greenhaus
also
recommended
that
osha
prohibit
three
activities
during
brake
operations
:
dry
brushing
,
air
hose
cleaning
and
use
of
nonhepa
hepa
vacuums
.
niosh
agreed
that
such
prohibitions
are
necessary
and
osha
concurs
.
