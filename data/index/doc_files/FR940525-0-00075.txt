the
impact
of
this
final
rule
on
small

is
expected
to
be
insignificant
.
this
final
regulation
imposes
additional
informational
requirements
on
entities
controlled
by
foreign
governments
.
most
businesses
affected
by
this
rule
will
likely
be
large
businesses
,
because
these
are
the
most
likely
to
be
controlled
by
a
foreign
government
.
accordingly
,
it
is
certified
that
the
final
rule
will
not
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
.
discussion
of
the
final
rule
section
837a
)
of
the
defense
authorization
act
creates
for
the
first
time
a
mandatory
investigation
provision
under
exonflorio
exon
florio
.
there
are
three
points
worth
noting
about
this
provision
.
first
,
this
provision
is
limited
in
application
to
certain
types
of
acquisitions
.
specifically
,
the
acquirer
in
question
must
be
a
foreign
government
controlled
entity
,
or
an
entity
acting
on
behalf
of
a
foreign
government
.
furthermore
,
the
acquisition
must
be
one
which
`
could
result
in
control
of
a
person
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
in
the
united
states
that
could
affect
the
national
security
of
the
united
states
'
(
emphasis
added
.
thus
,
even
where
the
other
specified
criteria
are
met
,
this
provision
does
not
mandate
an
investigation
for
cases
that
could
not
`
affect
the
national
security
of
the
united
states
'
second
,
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
the
acquisition
results
in
foreign
government
control
,
cfius
is
applying
the
same
functional
test
for
control
as
provided
in
section
800
204
.
third
,
in
contrast
to
the
criterion
for
presidential
action
under
exonflorio
exon
florio
,
ie
.
,
,
that
the
foreign
party
acquiring
control
might
take
action
that
`
threatens
to
impair
the
national
security
'
the
criterion
for
undertaking
an
investigation
of
transactions
involving
government
controlled
entities
is
that
there
could
be
an
effect
on
the
national
security
.
the
term
`
foreign
government
'
has
been
broadly
defined
for
purposes
of
these
regulations
to
include
any
government
or
body
exercising
governmental
functions
,
and
includes
but
is
not
limited
to
national
as
well
as
various
regional
and
local
levels
of
government
.
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
definition
is
not
limited
to
the
particular
levels
of
government
that
are
specified
in
the
regulation
,
and
that
other
governmental
bodies
,
including
supranational
supra
national
entities
such
as
the
european
union
(
including
its
component
parts
,
are
covered
by
this
regulation
.
for
purposes
of
the
mandatory
investigation
provision
,
the
regulations
define
the
term
`
engage
in
'
as
used
in
the
phrase
`
seeks
to
engage
in
any
merger
,
acquisition
or
takeover
*
*
*
*
*
'
to
mean
`
seeks
to
acquire
control
through
'
the
purpose
of
this
regulation
is
to
clarify
that
the
mandatory
investigation
provision
would
not
be
triggered
in
cases
where
a
foreign
government
controlled
entitys
participation
in
an
acquisition
is
solely
for
the
purpose
of
investment
,
as
defined
in
section
800
217
of
the
regulations
.
the
committee
believes
that
this
reading
is
supported
by
the
legislative
history
,
and
particularly
floor
statements
made
by
members
of
congress
who
sponsored
this
particular
amendment
.

has

regulations
by
the
addition

words

to
clarify
that
an

role
are
examples
of
ways

which
a
foreign

can
act
on

of
a
