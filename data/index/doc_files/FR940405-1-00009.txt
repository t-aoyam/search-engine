description
of
the
proposed
action
:
the
proposed
action
is
the
establishment
of
revised
energy
conservation
standards
for
room
air
conditioners
,
water
heaters
,
direct
heating
equipment
,
mobile
home
furnaces
,
kitchen
ranges
and
ovens
,
pool
heaters
and
fluorescent
lamp
ballasts
,
and
to
consider
standards
for
televisions
.
environmental
impacts
:
the
ea
evaluates
the
environmental
impacts
of
a
range
of
new
candidate
energy
conservation
standards
for
eight
types
of
household
appliances
.
the
results
are
presented
for
each
potential
standard
level
for
each
of
the
eight
appliance
types
.
each
potential
standard
level
is
an
alternative
action
,
and
the
environmental
impacts
of
each
alternative
are
compared
to
what
would
be
expected
to
happen
if
no
new
standards
for
each
product
were
finalized
,
ie
,
the
`
no
action
'
alternative
.
the
main
environmental
concern
is
emissions
from
fossilfueled
fossil
fueled
electricity
generation
.
most
of
the
design
options
for
the
eight
appliances
would
result
in
decreased
electricity
use
and
,
therefore
,
a
reduction
of
power
plant
emissions
.
the
proposed
efficiency
standards
would
generally
decrease
air
pollution
by
decreasing
future
energy
demand
.
the
greatest
decreases
in
air
pollution
would
be
for
sulfur
oxides
,
listed
in
equivalent
weight
of
sulfur
dioxide
,
or
so
.
.
reductions
of
nitrogen
oxides
and
carbon
dioxide
would
also
occur
and
are
listed
by
weight
of
no
and
co
,
,
respectively
.
design
options
for
many
of
the
appliances
(
ie
,
gas
and
oil
water
heaters
,
gas
pool
heaters
,
direct
heating
equipment
,
mobile
home
furnaces
,
and
gas
ranges
and
ovens
)
would
also
reduce
inhome
in
home
fuel
consumption
,
resulting
in
lower
inhome
in
home
emissions
from
fuelburning
fuel
burning
appliances
.
although
the
quantity
of
raw
materials
used
per
appliance
would
remain
relatively
constant
,
in
most
scenarios
increased
initial
prices
from
standards
are
expected
to
reduce
slightly
the
number
of
appliances
sold
,
which
would
result
in
small
decreases
in
the
total
amount
of
raw
materials
used
.
the
main
effect
of
this
decreased
appliance
production
would
be
the
so
decreases
from
avoided
fuel
burning
at
power
plants
.
the
environmental
contribution
from
reduced
steel
production
is
not
included
in
the
estimates
for
net
so
decreases
resulting
from
design
changes
in
these
products
.
