tentative
position
is
to
consider
amending
the
federal
poultry
products
inspection
regulations
to
define
the
standardized
product
that
results
from
the
mechanical
separation
and
removal
of
most
of
the
bone
from
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
by
a
distinctive
name
.
fsis
is
tentatively
considering
that
`
mechanically
separated
(
kind
)
(
msk
'
is
an
appropriate
,
nonmisleading
name
for
this
product
.
it
appears
to
accurately
and
concisely
describe
the
product
,
indicating
the
nature
of
the
process
by
which
and
the
kind
of
poultry
from
which
it
is
made
,
distinguishing
it
from
poultry
product
ingredients
produced
by
traditional
handdeboning
hand
deboning
techniques
.
the
name
under
consideration
includes
`
kind
'
rather
than
`
poultry
'
to
make
it
clear
that
the
kind
of
poultry
(

)
from
which
the
product
is
made
is
specified
(
eg
,
`
mechanically
separated
chicken
.
as
previously
indicated
,
fsis
believes
that
mdp
differs
sufficiently
from
boneless
poultry
products
produced
by
traditional
handdeboning
hand
deboning
techniques
that
it
should
be
regulated
as
a
separate
,
standardized
ingredient
.
as
such
,
this
product
would
be
defined
by
its
own
,
distinctive
name
,
and
it
would
be
referred
to
by
that
name
in
relevant
regulations
and
in
labeling
.
in
this
regard
,
fsis
is
requesting
public
input
on
other
names
that
would
accurately
and
appropriately
describe
mdp
as
a
distinct
ingredient
.
fsis
is
aware
that
other
descriptions
have
been
associated
with
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanically
deboning
.
in
addition
to
the
use
of
terminology
such
as
`
finely
comminuted
'
poultry
to
specify
the
form
of
the
product
and
`
mechanically
deboned
'
poultry
,
such
product
has
been
referred
to
as
mechanically
separated
poultry
within
the
meat
and
poultry
industries
.
fsis
believes
that
where
a
primary
distinguishing
characteristic
of
a
standardized
product
is
its
bone
content
,
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
define
it
by
a
name
that
includes
the
term
`
deboned
'
and
use
of
this
term
in
labeling
might
mislead
consumers
by
implying
such
product
contains
no
bone
.
persons
commenting
on
this
portion
of
the
anpr
should
be
aware
that
fsis
does
not
consider
that
current
familiarity
with
terminology
or
its
appeal
to
consumers
is
dispositive
on
the
question
of
what
terminology
is
most
likely
to
achieve
its
objectives
for
the
name
of
a
standardized
product
:
instantaneous
consumer
familiarity
and
acceptance
cannot
and
should
not
be
expected
when
labels
declare
the
presence
of
a
product
for
the
first
time
.
however
,
consumer
perceptions
are
important
in
determining
whether
or
not
terminology
that
is
technically
accurate
nevertheless
may
be
confusing
or
even
misleading
.
when
fsis
establishes
a
definition
and
standard
for
a
product
with
respect
to
which
a
specified
name
is
deemed
appropriate
,
the
product
must
be
called
by
that
name
in
labeling
.

tentative
position
:
bone

content
.
fsis
is
considering
that
a
definition
and
standard
for
mdp
would
incorporate
the
existing
restriction
on
the
bone
solids
content
of
mechanically
deboned
poultry
products
,
viz
,
not
more
than
one
percent
(

.
because
this
restriction
is
enforced
by
limiting
calcium
content
,
fsis
is
considering
that
the
definition
and
standard
for
mdp
should
include
maximum
calcium
content
levels
of
not
more
than
0
235
percent
in
product
made
from
turkeys
or
mature
chickens
or
0
175
percent
in
product
made
from
other
poultry
,
as
a
measure
of
bone
solids
contentbased
on
the
weight
of
product
that
has
not
been
prepared
with
heat
treatment
.
as
previously
discussed
,
fsis
adopted
the
one
percent
bone
solids
restriction
after
appraising
the
operating
results
in
a
series
of
poultry
plants
using
mechanical
deboning
equipment
,
analyzing
485
samples
of
raw
product
,
and
concluding
that
existing
equipment
can
be
operated
under
commercial
conditions
to
produce
product
which
meets
this
limit
(

when
processors
applied
the
mechanical
deboning
technology
to
poultry
products
such
as
fowl
frames
that
have
been
heat
treated
using
various
cooking
methods
,
fsis
modified
its
procedures
to
take
into
account
weight
loss
that
can
occur
with
cooking
.
thus
,
the
practice
has
been
to
permit
an
allowance
for
weight
loss
in
order
to
reflect
the
bone
solids
content
that
would
have
been
present
if
heat
treatment
has
not
occurred
;
and
the
adjusted
level
may
not

after
evaluating
data
on
substances
of
potential
concern
that
may
tend
to
concentrate
in
bone
,
the
1979
report
on
health
and
safety
aspects
of
the
use
of
mechanically
deboned
poultry
did
not
recommend
any
change
in
the
existing
bone
solids
limit
.
(
the
report
did
,
however
,
recommend
limitations
on
the
use
of
product
made
from
fowl
because
of
bone
constituents
like
fluoride
;
fsiss
tentative
position
is
to
amend
the
poultry
products
inspection
regulations
accordingly
,
as
discussed
below
)
because
enforcement
is
based
on
calcium
content
analyses
,
rather
than
direct
measurements
of
bone
solids
,
fsis
is
considering
that
an
amended
regulation
would
include
the
maximum
amount
of
calcium
permitted
in
determining
whether
mechanically
deboned
poultry
is
in
compliance
.
as
discussed
below
,
fsis
is
also
considering
that
production
under
an
approved
quality
control
program
is
needed
to
assure
that
such
product
is
manufactured
to
comply
with
regulatory
requirements
on
a
consistent
basis
and
that
implementation
of
a
quality
control
program
would
increase
the
effectiveness
of
enforcement
of
the
restriction
on
bone
solids
content
.
