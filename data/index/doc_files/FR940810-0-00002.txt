published
interim
regulations

'

with
a
60day
day
comment

.
these
regulations
were
made
effective
retroactive
to
11/01/1993
.
on

,
at

opm
published
final
regulations
to
implement
localitybased

comparability
payments
under
the
`
federal
employees
pay
comparability
act
of
1990
'
(

(

the
locality
pay
regulations
revised
the
definitions
of
scheduled
annual
rate
of
pay
in
§
531
101
and
531
301
which
were
previously
published
in
the
interim
regulations
implementing
the
pmrs
termination
act
.
the
final
regulations
on
locality
pay
were
made
effective
01/01/1994
,
and
were
applicable
on
the
first
day
of
the
first
pay
period
beginning
on
or
after
01/01/1994
.
on
02/03/1994
,
at

fr

,
opm
published
corrections
to
fix
three
typographical
errors
in
the
interim
regulations
for
pmrs
termination
.
during
the
comment
period
,
which
ended
02/14/1994
,
opm
received
three
comments
,
each
from
a
different
federal
agency
.
one
agency
suggested
revising
the
regulations
to
clarify
that
employees
cannot
`
become
'
gm
employees
after
11/01/1993
,
and
to
specify
the
personnel
actions
that
would
trigger
loss
of
gm
status
.
a
second
agency
asked
for
clarification
of
whether
an
employee
who
loses
coverage
as
a
result
of
a
temporary
promotion
regains
coverage
when
the
temporary
promotion
ends
,
and
if
so
,
how
the
employees
pay
would
be
set
.
a
third
agency
felt
that
the
text
of
§
531
406
)
(
iiii
)
specifying
when
time
in
a
nonpay
pay
status
is
creditable
service
for
a
withingrade
within
grade
increase
should
be
simplified
.
the
agency
also
asserted
that
certain
definitions
in
§
531
101
and
531
301
were
superseded
by
revised
definitions
in
the
final
locality
pay
regulations
.
finally
,
it
was
called
to
our
attention
that
the
instructions
for
setting
pay
on
loss
of
gm
status
should
be
revised
to
clarify
that
pay
retention
is
not
required
if
an
employee
requests
a
reduction
in
grade
.
following
are
the
major
issues
raised
,
a
summary
of
comments
on
each
issue
,
and
a
discussion
of
changes
made
to
the
interim
regulations

the
definition
of
gm
employee
and
loss
of
status

a
gm
employee
.
summary
of
comments
:
one
agency
suggested
that
the
statutory
basis
(
pub
.
l
.
10389
)
for
the
definition
of
gm
employee
should
be
introduced
in
its
regulatory
definition
in
§
531
202
.
the
agency
also
noted
that
the
timing
and
basis
for
gm
status
could
be
clarified
.
another
agency
specifically
asked
for
clarification
of
whether
an
employee
who
loses
gm
status
when
temporarily
promoted
after
10/31/1993
,
regains
gm
status
when
the
temporary
promotion
ends
.
discussion
and
changes
:
opm
is
adopting
the
suggestion
that
section
4
of
pub
.
l
.
10389
,
the
performance
management
and
recognition
system
termination
act
of
1993
,
be
introduced
in
the
definition
of
gm
employee
(
see
§
531
202
.
where
possible
,
we
are
replacing
references
to
coverage
under
section
4
of
the
act
with
references
to
the
amended
definition
of
gm
employee
and
,
where
appropriate
,
to
a
new
paragraph
,
`
status
as
a
gm
employee
'
(
see
§
531
203
,
which
specifies
personnel
actions
under
which
an
employee
would
retain
or
permanently
lose
gm
status
(
see
531
204
(
d
,
(
e
)
and
(
f
,
and
§
536
308
.
also
,
§
531
204
)
and
the
definition
of
gm
employee
have
been
amended
to
remove
any
suggestion
that
status
as
a
gm
employee
can
be
acquired
any
time
other
than
on
november
1
,
1993
,
the
effective
date
of
section
4
of
the
act
.
when
a
temporary
promotion
begins
after
10/31/1993
,
coverage
under
section
4
of
the
pmrs
termination
act
(
gm
status
)
ends
because
of
the
change
in
grade
.
coverage
cannot
be
regained
once
it
is
lost
because
it
is
linked
to
continuous
service
as
a
supervisor
or
management
official
in
the
same
grade
and
in
the
same
agency
after
10/31/1993
.
coverage
is
acquired
only
once
,
on
11/01/1993
.
