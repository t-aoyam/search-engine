and
the
title
to
part
2013
are
amended
by
deleting
references
to
the
firmr
system
.
the
firmr
system
was
established
to
permit
agencies
to
issue
regulations
that
implement
or
supplement
the
firmr
as
part
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations
(
cfr
.
gsa
has
determined
that
agencies
have
not
issued
such
regulations
in
the
cfr
since
the
establishment
of
the
firmr
,
and
that
a
firmr
system
is
therefore
,
unnecessary
.
removal
of
this
provision
does
not
mean
that
agencies
may
not
issue
internal
agency
directives
or
orders
to
implement
or
supplement
firmr
provisions
.
(
b
)
section
2011
003
paragraph
(
d
)
is
amended
by
deleting
responsibilities
of
the
archivist
of
the
united
states
.
it
is
the
intent
of
the
firmr
to
only
implement
gsas
authorities
and
responsibilities
.
including
the
archivists
responsibilities
in
the
firmr
is
,
therefore
,
unnecessary
.

paragraphs
(
a
)

)
through
(

text
was
taken
from
the
paperwork
reduction
act
.
however
,
not
all
provisions
were
excerpted
.
this
resulted
in
some
confusion
.
accordingly
,
the
text
is
being
removed
so
that
agencies
will
refer
to
the
paperwork
reduction
act
to
learn
the
specific
responsibilities
of
the
designated
senior
official
.
(
d
)
section
2012
001
paragraph
(
b
)
is
amended
by
removing
the
last
sentence
which
pertained
to
agencies
not
subject
to
the
paperwork
reduction
act

this
information
is
adequately
covered
in
§
2012

.
(

)
section
2012

is
amended
by
changing
the
sequence
of
paragraphs
(
a

revised
sequence
more
accurately
aligns
the
responsibilities
of
the
agency
designated
senior

the
federal
acquisition
regulation
(

section
2013
001
is
amended
to
remove
unnecessary
details
which
pertain
to

this
information
is
more
appropriately
discussed
in
§
2013
203
.
section
2013
203
paragraph
(
c
)
replaces
the
term
`
termporary
change
'
with
the
words
`
interim
rule
'
to
standardize
terminology
pertaining
to
revising
the
firmr

also
removed
for
brevity
is
a
redundant
sentence
that
lists
the
various
types
of
guidance
material
already
described
