in
1969
,
the
department
amended
the
regulations
for
poultry
and
poultry
products
inspection
to
,
among
other
things
,
provide
labeling
requirements
for
boneless
poultry
products
,
including
a
prescribed
bone
solids
content
of
not
more
than
one
percent
(
34
fr
13991
.
this
limit
was
based
on
an
evaluation
conducted
by
the
department
of
the
operating
results
in
a
series
of
poultry
plants
that
used
mechanical
deboning
equipment
.
analyses
were
made
of
485
samples
of
raw
,
mechanically
deboned
product
from
nine
commercial
operations
that
used
the
three
types
of
machines
most
often
used
in
the
process
.
the
analyses
showed
that
the
equipment
,
at
that
time
,
could
be
operated
under
commercial
conditions
to
produce
boneless
poultry
that
contained
no
more
than
one
percent
bone
solids
,
on
a
raw
weight
basis
,
and
the
department
concluded
that
it
was
demonstrated
that
it
was
practical
to
limit
the
bone
content
in
deboned
poultry
to
one
percent
.
in
light
of
the
improvements
that
have
occurred
with
regard
to
the
machinery
used
to
mechanically
separate
and
remove
most
of
the
bone
from
the
muscle
and
other
tissues
of
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of
carcasses
,
fsis
recently
conducted
a
study
of
the
bone
solids
content
of
mechanically
deboned
poultry
.
the
percentage
of
bone
solids
content
(
determined
by
calcium
analysis
)
in
boneless
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanically
deboning
was
collected
from
approximately
50
plants
during
08/19/1993
,
and
represented
a
sampling
of
over
2000
products
.
the
data
indicate
that
the
mean
bone
solids
content
of
the
samples
of
these
products
was
approximately
06
percent
;
generally
,
half
of
the
percentages
were
above
06
percent
and
half
were
below
06
percent
.

products
in
which
such

fsis
indicated
it
was
considering
the
need
for
rulemaking
that
would
establish
regulations
on
the
labeling
of

products
in
which
such

is
used

discussions

fsis
received
2744
comments
in
response
to
the

,
most
of
which
were
general

the

responded
to
whether
there
was
a
