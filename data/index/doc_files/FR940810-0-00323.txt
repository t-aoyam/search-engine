this
is
necessary
to
determine

,
because
the
analyst
will
be
looking
at
a
reduced

.
note
:
heating
above
600
&
circ
will
cause
the
sample
to
undergo
a
structural
change
which
,
given
sufficient
time
,
will
convert
the
chrysotile
to
forsterite
.
heating

h
may
have
a
measurable
effect

properties
of
the
minerals
.
if
the
analyst
is
unsure
of
what
to
expect
,
a
sample
of
standard
asbestos
should
be
heated
to
the
same
temperature
for
the

length
of

so
that
it
