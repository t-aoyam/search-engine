.
applicants
request
an
exemptive
order
to
the
extent
that
the
proposed
issuance
and
sale
of
various
classes
of
shares
representing
interests
in
the
same
fund
might
be
deemed
:
(
a
)
to
result
in
a
`
senior
security
'
within
the
meaning
of
section
18g
;
(
b
)
prohibited
by
section
18f1
;
and
(
c
)
to

.
applicants
believe
that
the
proposed
multiclass
class
arrangement
will
better
enable
the
funds
to
meet
the
competitive
demands
of
todays
financial
services
industry
.
under
the
multiclass
class
arrangement
,
an
investor
will
be
able
to
choose
the
method
of
purchasing
shares
that
is
most
beneficial
given
the
amount
of
his
or
her
purchase
,
the
length
of
time
the
investor
expects
to
hold
his
or
her
shares
,
and
other
relevant
circumstances
.
the
proposed
arrangement
would
permit
the
funds
to
facilitate
both
the
distribution
of
their
securities
and
provide
investors
with
a
broader
choice
as
to
the
method
of
purchasing
shares
without
assuming
excessive
accounting
and
bookkeeping
costs
or
unnecessary
investment
risks
.

applicants
further
believe
that
the
proposed
allocation
of
expenses
and
voting
rights
relating
to
the
plans
in
the
manner
described
in
the
application
is
equitable
and
would
not
discriminate
against
any
group
of
shareholders
.
in
addition
,
such
arrangements
should
not
give
rise
to
any
conflicts
of
interest
because
the
rights
and
privileges
of
each
class
of
shares
are
substantially
identical
.

.
applicants
submit
that
the
proposed
multiclass
class
arrangement
does
not
present
any
concerns
that
section
18
was
designed
to
ameliorate
.
the
multiclass
class
arrangement
does
not
involve
borrowings
,
does
not
affect
a
funds
existing
assets
or
reserves
,
and
does
not
involve
a
complex
capital
structure
.
the
multiclass
class
arrangement
will
not
increase
the
speculative
character
of
the
shares
of
the
funds
.
no
class
of
shares
will
have
preference
or
priority
over
any
other
class
of
shares
in
a
fund
with
respect
to
particular
assets
,
and
no
class
of
shares
will
be
protected
by
any
reserve
or
other
account
.

.
applicants
submit
that
the
requested
exemption
to
permit
the
funds
to
implement
the
proposed
cdsc
is
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
,
and
is
consistent
with
the
protection
of
investors
and
the
purposes
fairly
intended
by
the
policy
and
provisions
of
the
act
.
the
proposed
cdsc
arrangements
will
provide
shareholders
the
option
of
having
greater
investment
dollars
working
for
them
from
the
time
of
their
purchase
than
if
a
sales
load
had
been
imposed
at
such
time
