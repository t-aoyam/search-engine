for
maintaining
the

current
policy
on

valid

however
,
a
substantial

of

reflect
the
consumers

that
poultry
product
produced

the

years

the

have
referred

as
`

`

and

several

manufacturers
have
alleged
that
,
without
a
regulatory
definition
and
standard
for
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
,
a
disparate
situation
exists
between
labeling
certain
poultry
products

mechanical
deboning
and
mss
)
which
poses
an
unfair
advantage
for
the
manufacturers
of
poultry
products
and
may
deny
consumers
useful
information
.
fsis
has
considered
the
appropriate
course
for
addressing
these
issues
,
and
has
initiated
two
actions
in
response
to
them
.
fsis
is
contemplating
proposing
regulations
on
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
,
and
is
soliciting
comments
and
requesting
data
on
various
tentative
positions
in
this
advance
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
.
the
other
action
is
a
proposal
found
elsewhere
in
this
issue
of
the
federal
register
which
amends
the
federal
meat
inspection
regulations
by
amending
the
definition
of
