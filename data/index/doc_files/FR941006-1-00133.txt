fda
also
tentatively
concludes
that
the
label
must
state
:
`
if
a
child
accidentally
swallows
this
product
,
call
a
doctor
or
a
poison
control
center
immediately
'
fda
agrees
with
the
ndma
petition
that
treatmentoriented
treatment
oriented
information
should
be
included
on
the
label
because
it
informs
attending
persons
in
a
poisoning
incident
of
the
need
to
take
immediate
action
that
could
save
the
childs
life
and
about
what
that
action
should
be
.
thus
,
it
relates
directly
to
the
consequences
of
use
of
the
product
.
fda
does
not
believe
that
the
warning
statement
should
be
based
upon
or
contain
information
relating
to
the
potency
of
the
iron
product
(
ie
,
different
statements
for
products
above
and
below
30
mg
per
dosage
unit
as
requested
by
the
ag
petition
,
or
reference
to
`
large
doses
'
of
iron
as
a
factor
in
determining
whether
poisoning
may
occur
.
the
agency
tentatively
finds
that
such
statements
could
cause
members
of
the
public
to
attempt
to
determine
whether
a
large
dose
has
been
taken
in
a
possible
poisoning
incident
.
because
most
people
are
not
capable
of
determining
what
dosage
of
iron
may
be
nontoxic
,
toxic
,
or
capable
of
causing
serious
harm
or
death
,
qualified
medical
or
poison
control
personnel
should
determine
the
significance
of
the
dose
a
child
has
ingested
.
nor
does
there
appear
to
be
any
reason
to
require
that
the
statement
include
reference
to
the
specific
types
of
consequences
that
may
arise
from
acute
overdosage
,
ie
,
nausea
,
vomiting
,
cardiovascular
collapse
,
as
requested
by
the
ag
petition
.
fda
does
not
believe
that
this
information
would
materially
add
to
the
label
statement
that
overdose
can
cause
harm
or
death
,
and
fears
that
it
may
lead
to
the
erroneous
conclusion
that
,
because
a
child
does
not
exhibit
one
of
the
listed
symptoms
,
the
child
is
not
in
danger
.
e
.
how
should
the
warning
appear
on
the
label
?
fda
agrees
with
the
ags
'
contention
that
the
warning
statement
should
appear
prominently
on
the
label
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
to
effectively
convey
its
message
.
further
,
the
act
specifically
requires
,
in
sections

and
502c
,
that
information
required
to
appear
on
the
label
of
a
food
or
a
drug
be
prominently
placed
and
appear
with
such
conspicuousness
,
as
compared
with
other
printed
matter
,
as
to
render
it
likely
to
be
read
by
the
ordinary
individual
under
customary
conditions
of
use
.
however
,
the
ag
petition
provided
no
evidence
to
support
the
specific
presentation
elements
that
it
requested
for
the
warning
statement
,
ie
,
that
it
be
boxed
,
in
boldface
type
,
and
in
a
color
that
contrasts
with
the
background
and
with
other
printed
material
on
the
label
or
labeling
.
the
agency
is
not
aware
of
any
basis
on
which
it
can
conclude
that
any
of
these
specific
elements
are
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
statement
appears
on
the
label
in
a
prominent
and
conspicuous
manner
.
further
,
in
the
agencys
rulemaking
that
mandated
warning
statements
on
certain
protein
products
,
the
agency
decided
not
to
mandate
specific
requirements
for
letter
size
and
other
format
elements
.
however
,
the
agency
did
require
that
the
warning
statement
appear
`
prominently

conspicuously
on
the
principal

of
the

fda
made
a
determination
to
give
manufacturers
flexibility
to
design
their
own
label
warning
formats
,
while
ensuring
that
the
statement
is
prominent
and
conspicuous
,
so
that
consumers
are
given
adequate
notice
of
the

in
addressing
the
placement
of

,
the

noted
that
the
seriousness
and
nature
of
the
risk
associated
with
the
use
of
protein
products
in
very
low
calorie
diets
was
sufficient
to
require

of
the

defines
the

as
`
a
display
of
written

printed
,
or

matter
upon
the

and
further
states
that
a

that

not
be

thus
,
if
fda
requires
a
label
warning
statement
to
appear
on
the
immediate
container
of

iron

,
it
would
also
have
to
appear
on
the
retail
package
of
such
a

if
that

is
not
the

as
stated
above
,
the
fact
that
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
have
resulted
in
reports
of
2000
poisonings
in
children
over
approximately
7
years
provides
evidence
that
many
adults
are
not
aware
of
the
potential
for
serious
harm
posed
by
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
based
on
this
fact
,
fda
tentatively
finds
that
there
are
sufficient
grounds
to
require
that
the
label
warning
statement
be
printed
directly
on
the
immediate
container
of
the

the
container
that

and
on

of

an

,
if

is

many

are
packaged
in
this
manner

if
a

is
sold
in

packaging
,
this
requirement
will
mean
that
the

will
have
to
bear
the

directly
on
each

package
or
on
a
strip
