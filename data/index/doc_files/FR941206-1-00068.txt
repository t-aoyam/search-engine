the
format
must
accommodate
multiple
compliance
techniques
for
the
various
industry
segments
;
2
.
given
the
large
number
of
small
businesses
in
this
source
category
,
the
format
must
ensure
that
the
cost
of
compliance
is
not
excessive
;

.
the
format
must
ensure
that
an
equivalent
level
of
control
is
achieved
by
all
affected
sources
;
and
4
.
the
format
must
facilitate
enforcement
by
regulatory
agencies
.
during
the
negotiation
meetings
,
the
committee
considered
several
formats
for
the
finishing
operations
standards
in
addition
to
the
selected
format
of
pounds
of
vhap
emitted
per
pound
of
solids
used
.
these
included
:
(
1
)
a
percent
efficiency
format
,
(
2
)
a
limit
on
emissions
of
hap
per
gallon
of
coating
,
and
(
3
)
a
limit
on
emissions
of
hap
per
gallon
of
solids
.
for
all
haplimit
hap
limit
formats
,
including
the
one
selected
for
the
proposed
standards
,
the
quantity
of
hap
used
annually
is
calculated
as
applied
(
the
total
emissions
from
a
coating
after
any
thinning
by
the
furniture
manufacturer
.
therefore
,
if
prepurchased
coatings
were
diluted
with
thinner
at
a
facility
,
this
dilution
was
accounted
for
.
a
measurement
work
group
comprised
of
some
of
the
committee
members
was
established
by
the
committee
to
investigate
these
potential
regulatory
formats
.
the
measurement
work
group
determined
that
a
percent
reduction
format
was
not
appropriate
for
this
source
category
.
in
debating
a
percent
reduction
format
,
the
measurement
work
group
considered
the
fact
that
conventional
control
devices
were
not
likely
to
be
the
compliance
method
of
choice
for
this
source
category
.
therefore
,
a
straightforward
measurement
of
capture
and
control
device
efficiency
would
not
be
sufficient
to
demonstrate
compliance
with
a
specific
percent
reduction
.
instead
,
to
implement
a
percent
reduction
format
,
baseline
conditions
at
each
affected
source
would
have
to
be
assessed
.
at
an
uncontrolled
facility
this
would
not
be
a
problem
;
baseline
conditions
would
be
the
current
hap
emission
rate
.
the
percent
reduction
would
be
applied
to
this
uncontrolled
rate
to
calculate
the
controlled
hap
emission
rate
required
by
the
standards
.
problems
with
the
percent
reduction
format
arise
,
however
,
if
a
facility
has
implemented
control
strategies
prior
to
proposal
of
the
mact
standards
.
if
the
same
baseline
year
is
selected
for
both
the
uncontrolled
and
controlled
facility
,
the
controlled
facility
would
be
required
to
control
a
greater
quantity
of
hap
emissions
than
the
uncontrolled
facility
.
thus
,
a
percent
reduction
format
was
perceived
as
penalizing
sources
that
initiated
control
strategies
prior
to
proposal
of
the
mact
standards
.
the
committee
agreed
with
the
measurement
work
groups
recommendation
that
a
percent
reduction
format
not
be
selected
for
this
source
category
.
initially
,
the
measurement
work
group
considered
a
limit
on
the
pounds
of
hap
contained
in
a
gallon
of
finishing
material
(
lb
hap
gal
,
either
for
each
finishing
material
or
as
an
average
across
all
finishing
materials
.
in
analyzing
the
data
,
however
,
the
measurement
work
group
discovered
that
the
pounds
of
hap
per
gallon
of
finishing
material
format
would
not
credit
sources
that
switch
to
loweremitting
lower
emitting
,
highersolids
higher
solids
finishing
materials
.
for
example
,
a
facility
using
a
finishing
material
with
a
solids
content
of
40
percent
and
a
hap
content
of
3
lb
gal
will
emit
fewer
pounds
of
hap
than
a
facility
using
a
finishing
material
with
a
solids
content
of
20
percent
and
a
hap
content
of
2
lb
gal
because
the
first
facility
will
use
50
percent
less
finishing
material
than
the
second
.
because
the
hap
content
of
a
finishing
material
is
not
directly
related
to
the
solids
content
,
a
comparison
of
the
emission
potential
of
two
finishing
materials
using
a
lb
gal
format
cannot
be
made
.
as
an
alternative
to
the
lb
hap
gal
format
,
the
measurement
work
group
considered
a
format
of
lb
hap
gal
of
solids
.
it
was
believed
that
this
format
would
adequately
credit
sources
that
converted
some
or
all
of
their
conventional
finishing
materials
to
highersolids
higher
solids
coatings
.
a
problem
with
the
lb
hap
gal
solids
format
,
however
,
is
that
no
epa
test
method
is
currently
available
for
accurately
measuring
the
volume
of
solids
in
a
finishing
material
.
