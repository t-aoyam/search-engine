the

expressed
duponts
support
for

epa
is
currently
reviewing
a
petition
from
dupont
requesting
the
revocation
of
the
tolerance
established
under
section
409
of
the
ffdca
for
residues
of
the
fungicide

the
establshment
of
a
tolerance
for

under
section
408
of
the
ffdca
.
duponts
petition
contends
that
existing
section
409
tolerances
for
raisins
are
inappropriate
since
raisins
meet
the
statutory
definition
of
a
raw
agricultural

the

there
