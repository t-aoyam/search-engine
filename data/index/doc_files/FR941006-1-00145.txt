is
that

therefore
,
fda
requests

for

that
fda
could
take

forms
of
iron
that
may
be
less
toxic
nas
has
reported
that
,
during
the
period
from
1970
to
1987
,
food
manufacturers
increased
their
use
of
elemental
iron
(
ie
,
finely
divided
metallic
iron
)
by
120fold
fold
and
decreased
their
use
of
ferrous
sulfate
by
30
percent
(
ref
.
30
.
the
increase
in
the
use
of
elemental
iron
in
conventional
food
may
be
attributed
to
its
low
cost
and
minimal
reactivity
in
food
.
fda
is
not
aware
of
any
reports
of
accidental
ingestions
or
adverse
reactions
associated
with
the
few
commercially
available
ironcontaining
iron
containing
dietary
supplements
and
drug
products
that
incorporate
elemental
iron
instead
of
an
iron
salt
.
three
basic
types
of
elemental
iron
powders
are
marketed
for
use
in
foods
.
the
three
types
are
reduced
iron
,
electrolytic
iron
,
and
carbonyl
iron
.
the
term
`
carbonyl
'
refers
to
the
production
process
,
not
the
composition
of
the
product
.
the
bioavailability
of
these
various
elemental
iron
sources
is
dependent
primarily
on
their
physical
characteristics
,
which
in
turn
depend
on
the
manufacturing
method
.
for
example
,
higher
relative
bioavailabilities
of
elemental
iron
are
obtained
with
smaller
particle
sizes
.
some
evidence
suggests
that
carbonyl
iron
may
be
a
useful
substitute
for
the
more
commonly
used
chemical
compounds
of
iron
in
reducing
risk
of
accidental
iron
poisonings
.
data
from
studies
in
animals
suggest
that
carbonyl
iron
may
be
only
1/100th
as
toxic
as
ferrous
sulfate
in
single
doses
,
ie
,
the
ld
50
(
lethal
dose
for
50
percent
of
the
test
group
)
of
ferrous
sulfate
is
approximately
0
30
g
fe
kg
(
ref
.
32
)
and
the
ld
50
for
carbonyl
iron
is
approximately
30
g
fe
kg
body
weight
(
ref
.
31
.
thus
,
carbonyl
iron
,
in
comparison
with
ferrous
sulfate
,
appears
to
have
a
much
larger
margin
of
safety
between
the
level
that
would
provide
adequate
iron
nutrition
and
the
level
that
causes
acute
toxicity
.
consequently
,
carbonyl
iron
may
be
inherently
safer
to
use
.
at
the
same
time
,
data
from
human
subjects
indicates
that
the
overall
bioavailability
of
carbonyl
iron
in
supporting
the
nutritional
functions
of
iron
is
about
70
percent
that
of
ferrous
sulfate
(
ref
.
31
.
thus
carbonyl
iron
is
reasonably
as
effective
in
providing
iron
in
the
amounts
needed
to
achieve
the
nutritive
effects
of
iron
.
its
use
may
help
to
reduce
the
risk
of
iron
poisoning
in
children
.
fda
specifically
requests
comments
on
the
appropriateness
of
elemental
iron
as
a
source
of
iron
in
drugs
and
dietary
supplements
,
focusing
on
whether
its
use
in
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
would
decrease
the
risk
of
pediatric
poisonings
while
providing
desirable
iron
nutrition
to
those
who
need
iron
supplementation
.
the
agency
is
interested
in
receiving
data
on
the
potential
of
elemental
iron
for
acute
toxicity
in
humans
and
particularly
in
children
.
fda
will
carefully
consider
any
information
it
receives
on
this
subject
.
if
the
information
is
persuasive
in
establishing
that
the
use
of
elemental
iron
would
substantially
decrease
the
risk
of
pediatric
poisoning
while
allowing
for
effective
dietary
iron
supplementation
,
fda
will
consider
exempting
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
that
incorporate
elemental
iron
from
any
regulations
that
result
from
this
rulemaking
