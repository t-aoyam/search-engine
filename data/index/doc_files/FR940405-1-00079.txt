would
like
to
consider
the
use
of
a
physiologically
based
pharmacokinetic
(

model
in
an
effort
to
develop
a
clear
and
complete
picture
of
factors
that
may
affect
environmental
exposure
measurements
,
internal
dose
estimates
and
ultimately
estimates
of
expected
risk
attributed
to
ets
exposure
at
the
workplace
.
osha
is
seeking
comment
on
appropriate
methodology
,
available
data
,
etc
.
the
following
discussion
offers
an
explanation
of
oshas
approach
to
this
issue
and
an
opportunity
for
the
agency
to
solicit
comment
on
specific
points
of
concern
as
they
relate
to
the
use
of
pharmacokinetics
in
estimating
occupational
risk
from
exposure
to
ets
.
estimating
the
risk
from
exposure
to
ets
requires
the
use
of
some
measure
of
the
extent
of
exposure
.
possible
measures
,
or
metrics
,
can
range
from
categorical
ranking
based
on
survey
responses
to
direct
measurement
of
etsrelated
ets
related
chemicals
in
the
body
fluids
of
exposed
individuals
.
in
general
,
the
use
of
an
internal
measure
of
individual
exposure
would
be
preferred
over
measurements
of
environmental
contamination
,
such
as
airborne
chemical
or
particulate
concentrations
.
in
particular
,
considerable
attention
has
been
given
in
the
scientific
literature
to
the
possible
use
of
cotinine
concentrations
in
body
fluids
as
a
biomarker
of
ets
exposure
[

however
,
obtaining
a
dependable
estimate
of
exposure
from
measurements
of
a
chemicals
concentration
in
body
fluids
requires
a
quantitative
understanding
of
the
chemicals
pharmacokinetics
;
its
uptake
,
distribution
,
metabolism
,
and
excretion
.
following
is
a
review
of
the
evidence
concerning
the
suitability
of
cotinine
as
an
internal
biomarker
for
ets
exposure
.

.
considerations
for
selection
of
a
biomarker
for
ets
a
biomarker
should
,
to
the
greatest
extent
possible
,
accurately
represent
the
individuals
exposure
to
the
substance
of
concern
and
have
relevance
to
a
specific
endpoint
.
in
the
case
of
ets
,
there
are
several
relevant
endpoints
,
with
principal
attention
being
given
to
heart
disease
and
lung
cancer
.
each
different
endpoint
may
be
mediated
by
a
different
subset
of
the
components
of
ets
,
and
therefore
the
appropriate
biomarkers
)
for
each
endpoint
could
be
different
.

cardiovascular
effects
cardiovascular
effects
resulting
from
exposure
to
ets
have
been
associated
with
carbon
monoxide
(
co
,
nicotine
,
and
more
recently
with
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
(
pahs
)
[
ex
.
4123
.
each
of
these
is
associated
with
a
different
fraction
of
ets
;
co
is
a
gas
phase
constituent
,
nicotine
is
a
low
volatility
vapor
,
and
pahs
are
absorbed
on
particulates
.
because
of
the
significant
differences
in
physical
fate
and
transport
,
a
strategy
for
the
use
of
biomarkers
for
cardiovascular
effects
of
ets
would
ideally
make
use
of
separate
markers
for
co
,
nicotine
,
and
pahs
.
