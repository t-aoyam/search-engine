the

the

this
action
modifies

from

to

and
establishes

the
faa
has
determined
that
this
regulation
only
involves
an
established
body
of
technical
regulations
for
which
frequent
and
routine
amendments
are
necessary
to
keep
them

it

therefore

is
not
a

and
(

does
not
warrant
preparation
of
a
regulatory
evaluation
as
the
anticipated
impact
is
so
minimal
.
since
this
is
a
routine
matter
that
will
only
affect
air
traffic
procedures

navigation

it
is
certified
that
this
