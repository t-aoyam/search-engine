the

bureau
has
before
it
a
petition
for
an
interpretive
ruling
regarding
how
the
employees
of
radio
station
time
brokers
should
be
reported
on
the
fcc

the

they
request
that
the

issue
an

in
addition
,
the

filed

in

pleadings
2
.
the
firms
describe
several
specific
situations
and
ask
how
reports
should
be
filed
for
each
.
in
the
first
example
,
a
broker
is
a
licensee
of
another
station
in
the
same
market
as
the
brokered
station
to
which
the
broker
provides
programming
services
.
in
this
case
,
all
employees
are
employed
by
the
licenseebroker
licensee
broker
,
but
some
employees
'
duties
relate
exclusively
to
the
brokers
station
,
some
to
the
brokered
station
,
and
some
to
both
stations
.
the
firms
then
analyze
the
merits
of
various
reporting
methods
.
in
the
second
example
,
a
broker
is
not
a
licensee
of
a
station
in
the
same
market
as
the
brokered
station
.
moreover
,
the
broker
may
or
may
not
be
a
commission
licensee
.
again
,
while
all
employees
are
employed
by
the
broker
,
their
duties
relate
variably
to
the
brokers
station
(
in
the
case
of
licenseebrokers
licensee
brokers
,
the
brokered
station
,
or
both
.
the
firms
,
as
before
,
offer
their
analyses
of
various
reporting
methods
.
finally
,
in
a
third
example
,
the
firms
ask
how
shared
employees
should
be
reported
where
stations
in
the
same
radio
service
are
under
common
ownership
or
control
in
the
same
market
,
such
as
occurs
where
a
licensee
owns
two
fm
stations
in
the
same
market
.
iii
.
discussion
3
.
in
response
to
petitioners
'
request
,
this
interpretive
ruling
sets
forth
general
commission
policy
on
how
to
report
employees
on
form
395b
for
broadcast
stations
involved
in
time
brokerage
arrangements
.
as
a
general
matter
,
we
believe
that
,
consistent
with
the
eeo
rule
which
measures
licensee
performance
,
employees
hired
in
concert
with
time
brokerages
and
lmas
should
be
reported
on
the
form
395b
submitted
by
the
licensee
that
employs
them
.
thus
,
in
the
first
example
above
,
all
employees
hired
and
employed
by
the
licenseebroker
licensee
broker
and
whose
duties
include
providing
program
services
or
other
duties
in
support
of
the
lma
should
,
as
a
general
matter
,
be
reported
on
the
395b
filed
by
the
licenseebrokers
licensee
brokers
station
.
this
is
because
all
such
employees
are
either
employed
by
,
or
under
the
control
of
,
the
licenseebroker
licensee
broker
.
the
licensee
of
the
brokered
station
should
file
a
form
395b
for
any
employees
it
may
retain
or
hire
after
commencement
of
the
brokerage
agreement
.
4
.
in
the
second
example
above
,
whether
the
broker
is
a
licensee
or
not
,
there
is
no
cognizable
brokerage
agreement
because
the
broker
does
not
hold
an
interest
in
a
station
in
the
same
market
as
the
brokered
station
.
see
47
cfr
73
3555
.
however
,
where
the
broker
is
a
licensee
,
the
reporting
requirements
are
,
as
a
general
matter
,
no
different
from
the
first
example
above
.
the
licensee
of
the
brokered
station
should
file
a
form
395b
for
any
employees
it
may
retain
or
hire
after
commencement
of
the
brokerage
agreement
.
similarly
,
the
licenseebroker
licensee
broker
should
file
a
form
395b
for
its
employees
.
if
personnel
employed
by
the
licenseebroker
licensee
broker
perform
duties
for
both
stations
,
the
licenseebroker
licensee
broker
should
report
them
on
its
form
395b
.
if
the
licenseebroker
licensee
broker
employes
personnel
to
work
at
the
brokered
station
,
they
should
also
be
reported
on
the
form
395b
for
the
licenseebrokers
licensee
brokers
station
.
5
.
these
policies
are
not
inconsistent
with
prior
commission
statements
in
policy
statement
on
parttime
part
time
programming
,
82
fcc
2d

,

(

(
policy
statement
.
the
policy
statement
only
considered
whether
employees
of
a
nonlicensee
licensee
time
broker
should
be
reported
by
licensees
selling
blocks
of
their
airtime
to
brokers
.
the
commission
declined
to
require
licensees
of
brokered
stations
to
report
employees
of
a
nonlicensee
licensee
broker
as
part
of
the
eeo
employment
profile
.
our
ruling
here
merely
indicates
that
,
as
a
general
matter
,
time
brokers
who
are
themselves
licensees
should
report
individuals
under
their
employ
,
whether
they
work
at
the
licenseebrokers
licensee
brokers
station
or
a
station
operated
by
the
broker
under
an
lma
.
the
two
rulings
are
,
therefore
,
fully
consistent
.
in
addition
,
the
policy
statement
was
directed
at
the
typical
time
brokerage
existing
in
1980
,
which
involved
the
brokerage
by
nonlicensees
licensees
of
short
,
discrete
periods
of
broadcast
time
.
the
more
common
practice
today
is
for
large
blocks
of
time
or
the
entire
programming
schedule
of
a
station
to
be
brokered
.
when
that
practice
is
engaged
in
by
a
licenseebroker
licensee
broker
,
we
believe
it
generally
appropriate
that
the
licenseebroker
licensee
broker
comply
with
the
eeo
rule
and
its
attendant
reporting
obligations
.
6
.
in
accordance
with
the
reasoning
set
forth
in
policy
statement
,
if
the
broker
is
not
a
licensee
,
as
in
the
second
example
above
,
the
broker
is
not
required
to
file
a
form
395b
.
however
,
we
will
closely
watch
to
see
that
such
agreements
are
not
used
to
circumvent
our
eeo
rule
and
policies
.
