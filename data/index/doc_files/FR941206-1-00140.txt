a
difficult
aspect
of
protecting
sensitive
security
information
is
that
a
large
number
of
persons
must
be
aware
of
at
least
portions
of
the
information
in
order
to
carry
out
their
duties
.
these
include
pilots
,
flight
attendants
,
ticket
agents
,
screeners
,
baggage
handlers
,
and
law
enforcement
officers
.
frequently
,
some
of
these
people
are
not
direct
employees
of
the
air
carrier
or
airport
operator
,
but
they
do
carry
out
duties
for
or
on
behalf
of
the
air
carrier
or
airport
operator
.
for
instance
,
in
many
cases
,
screeners
and
law
enforcement
officers
are
not
directly
employed
by
air
carriers
or
airport
operators
,
but
do
have
important
security
responsibilities
to
carry
out
.
this
section
is
intended
to
cover
all
such
persons
who
have
access
to
sensitive
security
information
.
it
should
be
emphasized
,
however
,
that
airports
and
air
carriers
would
continue
to
have
the
responsibility
they
now
have
to
protect
sensitive
security
information
.
if
sensitive
security
information
is
released
to
unauthorized
persons
,
depending
upon
the
circumstances
,
the
faa
may
hold
the
airport
or
air
carrier
,
as
well
as
the
individual
,
accountable
.
section
1915a
)
would
state
the
general
requirement
that
disclosure
of
and
access
to
sensitive
security
information
shall
be
restricted
to
persons
with
a
`
need
to
know
'
section
1915b
)
would
define
`
need
to
know
'
as
the
requirement
to
have
knowledge
of
or
access
to
the
information
to
carry
out
faaapproved
faa
approved
or
directed
aviation
security
duties
.
of
course
,
in
the
case
of
foreign
air
carriers
that
are
owned
or
operated
,
or
closely
regulated
,
by
the
foreign
government
,
various
officials
in
that
government
have
a
`
need
to
know
'
in
most
cases
,
the
air
carrier
or
airport
operator
has
the
discretion
to
decide
who
in
its
organization
has
a
need
to
know
sensitive
security
information
.
there
are
times
,
however
,
when
information
is
so
sensitive
that
extra
measures
should
be
taken
to
protect
it
from
release
to
those
without
a
`
need
to
know
'
the
rule
would
,
therefore
,
provide
that
for
some
specific
information
the
assistant
administrator
may
make
a
finding
that
only
specific
persons
,
or
classes
of
persons
,
have
an
operational
need
to
know
.
section
1915c
)
would
require
that
,
if
sensitive
security
information
is
released
to
unauthorized
persons
,
the
faa
must
be
notified
.
this
will
permit
the
faa
to
evaluate
the
risk
presented
by
the
release
of
the
information
,
and
to
take
whatever
action
may
be
needed
to
mitigate
that
risk
.
section
1915d
)
alerts
persons
that
violations
may
result
in
a
civil
penalty
or
other
action
by
the
faa
.
under
the
faact
,
the
faa
may
take
a
broad
range
of
enforcement
action
for
violation
of
the
regulations
.
the
faa
anticipates
that
civil
penalty
action
will
be
considered
for
a
violation
of
part
191
,
as
it
is
for
violations
of
parts
107
and
108
.
however
,
the
faa
may
seek
any
enforcement
action
deemed
appropriate
based
on
individual
circumstances
of
the
case
.
further
,
the
faa
may
take
action
to
mitigate
or
correct
the
risk
posed
by
the
violation
.
such
actions
may
include
requiring
air
carriers
or
airport
operators
to
change
their
procedures
for
protecting
security
information
,
or
change
the
security
procedures
in
place
that
may
have
been
compromised
by
unauthorized
release
of
the
information
.
§
1917
.
proposed
1917
would
incorporate
and
expand
current
§
1913
,
which
describes
information
that
is
protected
from
public
disclosure
.
there
is
information
not
specifically
mentioned
in
§
1913
that
should
be
protected
.
the
faa
now
withholds
such
information
from
public
disclosure
based
on
findings
under
§
1915
that
disclosure
would
be
detrimental
to
the
safety
of
persons
traveling
in
air
transportation
or
intrastate
air
transportation
.
those
findings
are
set
forth
in
written
denials
of
foia
requests
for
such
information
,
and
in
declarations
submitted
to
judges
to
seek
protection
of
information
in
litigation
cases
.
to
better
inform
the
public
of
the
information
prohibited
from
unauthorized
release
,
the
faa
proposes
to
add
this
information
to
§
1917
,
as
described
below
:
section
1917a
)
would
retain
the
current
requirements
to
protect
any
approved
or
standard
security
program
for
an
air
carrier
,
indirect
air
carrier
,
airport
operator
,
or
foreign
air
carrier
,
and
that
portion
of
the
security
program
of
the
united
states
postal
service
that
relates
to
security
of
parcel
mail
to
be
transported
by
air
.
the
faa
proposes
to
expand
this
provision
to
include
any
comments
,
instructions
,
or
implementing
guidance
pertaining
to
these
security
programs
.
generally
,
these
materials
reveal
some
or
all
of
the
sensitive
information
and
must
be
protected
the
same
as
the
security
programs
themselves
.
paragraph
(
b
)
would
be
revised
to
include
any
comments
,
instructions
,
or
implementing
guidance
pertaining
to
security
directives
and
information
circulars
.
paragraph
(
c
)
would
list
any
profile
used
in
any
security
screening
process
,
including
persons
,
baggage
,
or
cargo
.
section
1913b
)
(
1
)
and
(
2
)
currently
cover
any
hijacker
profile
and
profile
used
in
baggage
screening
.
this
proposal
makes
that
provision
general
to
cover
profiles
for
screening
persons
,
because
there
are
systems
in
place
to
protect
against
terrorists
and
others
who
might
seek
to
commit
criminal
violence
,
not
just
hijackers
.
it
would
also
cover
profiles
for
cargo
.
like
baggage
,
cargo
is
a
potential
tool
for
criminal
violence
that
the
security
rules
cover
.
paragraph
(
d
)
would
include
any
security
contingency
plan
and
comments
,
instructions
,
or
implementing
guidance
pertaining
thereto
.
these
plans
,
when
adopted
,
become
part
of
the
security
program
and
are
already
covered
by
rules
governing
security
programs
.
they
are
included
in
§
1917
for
emphasis
.
the
faa
proposes
to
delete
the
provisions
currently
in
§
1913b6
,
pertaining
to
the
technical
specifications
for
devices
for
protection
against
,
or
detection
of
,
cargo
theft
,
from
the
rule
.
such
devices
are
not
directly
used
to
meet
the
requirements
for
civil
aviation
security
under
the
faa
regulations
.
any
devices
that
serve
a
dual
function
of
protecting
cargo
and
security
are
protected
under
other
provisions
in
this
section
.
paragraph
(
e
)
would
cover
the
technical
specifications
of
any
device
used
for
the
detection
of
any
explosive
,
incendiary
,
or
deadly
or
dangerous
weapon
.
it
is
essentially
the
same
as
current
§
1913b5
,
except
that
the
current
rule
is
worded
`
explosive
or
incendiary
device
or
weapon
'
the
proposed
rule
would
use
the
same
wording
that
is
in
§
1089a
,
which
contains
the
requirements
for
air
carriers
to
screen
passengers
and
property
for
such
items
.
