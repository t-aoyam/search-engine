requests
for
rehearing
the
indicated
parties
assert
that
the
commission
erred
in
permitting
interstate
pipelines
to
cease
to
submit
the
affiliated
transportation
log
(
form
592
)
90
days
after
the
commission
has
determined
that
an
individual
pipeline
is
in
full
compliance
with
order
no
.
636
.
the
indicated
parties
submit
that
the
information
available
on
form
592
may
be
more
essential
after
a
pipeline
complies
fully
with
order
no
.
636
than
it
is
now
.
the
indicated
parties
state
that
following
full
compliance
with
order
no
.
636
,
an
interstate
pipeline
will
be
permitted
to
sell
natural
gas
at
negotiated
prices
.
in
this
environment
,
the
indicated
parties
argue
that
such
a
pipeline
may
be
motivated
to
favor
its
own
sales
of
gas
as
well
as
sales
made
by
its
marketing
affiliates
.
for
example
,
the
indicated
parties
contend
that
to
obtain
a
sale
at
the
expense
of
other
sellers
,
a
pipeline
could
sell
its
gas
at
a
loss
or
a
very
low
price
,
but
charge
the
full
transportation
rate
.
the
indicated
parties
assert
that
this
would
allow
the
pipeline
to
avoid
the
correlative
discount
rule
under
§
1613i
,
and
charge
all
other
sellers
the
maximum
transportation
rate
rather
than
discounting
to
obtain
the
transportation
business
.
the
indicated
parties
argue
that
to
remain
competitive
,
nonaffiliated
affiliated
sellers
would
be
forced
to
reduce
their
gas
prices
below
what
they
would
charge
if
the
pipeline
discounted
its
transportation
rates
rather
than
the
price
at
which
the
pipeline
merchant
function
sells
its
gas
.
the
indicated
parties
contend
that
the
nonaffiliated
affiliated
sellers
would
suffer
a
loss
because
they
would
be
forced
to
sell
their
gas
at
a
loss
and
pay
the
full
transportation
rate
.
the
indicated
parties
assert
that
the
pipeline
,
however
,
would
not
suffer
the
same
economic
detriment
because
it
would
receive
the
full
transportation
rate
on
the
movement
of
its
gas
.
the
indicated
parties
submit
that
they
and
other
competing
merchants
will
be
unable
to
monitor
and
detect
such
favoritism
without
the
information
provided
on
form
592
.
the
indicated
parties
assert
that
the
difficulty
with
the
elimination
of
the
filing
of
form
592
is
that
the
commission
and
the
industry
have
no
experience
with
the
operation
of
ebbs
by
a
pipeline
in
full
compliance
with
order
no
.
636
.
the
indicated
parties
argue
that
the
commission
cannot
find
that
the
ebbs
will
prove
to
be
a
reliable
and
accurate
source
of
the
information
now
supplied
on
form
592
.
the
indicated
parties
state
that
in
light
of
this
practical
experience
,
the
commission
recently
requested
comments
on
the
configuration
and
operation
of
ebbs
in
docket
no
.
rm903/04/000
.
the
indicated
parties
state
that
in
the
list
of
questions
on
which
comments
were
requested
the
commission
asked
whether
`
any
of
this
information
[
available
on
the
ebbs
can
]
be
used
to
fulfill
existing
ferc
reporting
requirements
'
the
indicated
parties
contend
that
this
request
demonstrates
that
the
ebbs
are
an
unproven
means
of
communicating
the
information
now
available
on
form
592
.
the
indicated
parties
state
that
even
though
it
had
requested
comments
on
whether
it
could
eliminate
any
of
its
current
reporting
requirements
,
the
commission
,
without
even
waiting
for
an
answer
to
its
question
,
erroneously
assumed
in
order
no
.
497d
that
the
answer
would
be
`
yes
'
and
eliminated
one
of
its
reporting
requirements
.
the
indicated
parties
submit
that
the
disparity
between
the
requests
for
comments
and
the
elimination
of
a
reporting
requirement
in
order
no
.
497d
demonstrates
that
the
commission
acted
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
manner
without
substantial
evidence
in
eliminating
the
filing
of
form
592
.
the
indicated
parties
assert
that
the
commission
has
failed
to
protect
the
public
interest
with
its
elimination
of
the
requirement
that
pipelines
file
form
592
.
the
indicated
parties
argue
that
the
commission
should
grant
rehearing
and
reinstate
the
requirement
that
pipelines
file
form
592
.
hadson
also
asserts
that
the
commission
erred
in
eliminating
the
filing
of
form
592
.
hadson
states
that
under
order
no
.
636
pipelines
will
be
able
to
conduct
an
essentially
deregulated
gas
merchant
business
under
the
pipelines
corporate
entity
and
while
sharing
key
personnel
.
hadson
contends
that
this
arrangement
,
which
it
does
not
oppose
in
and
of
itself
,
nonetheless
creates
additional
opportunities
for
the
pipelinetransporter
pipeline
transporter
to
favor
both
its
own
merchant
division
as
well
as
its
affiliates
and
that
this
increases
rather
than
diminishes
the
need
for
public
scrutiny
.
hadson
argues
that
,
at
a
minimum
,
deregulating
the
pipelinemerchant
pipeline
merchant
can
certainly
not
be
invoked
as
grounds
for
a
decrease
in
the
need
for
public
monitoring
by
the
industry
watchdog
.
finally
,
hadson
notes
that
even
requiring
the
same
information
to
be
disclosed
on
an
ebb
is
materially
different
from
requiring
the
information
to
be
filed
with
the
commission
under
the
natural
gas
act
since
filings
with
the
commission
are
subject
to
18
usc
.
1001
while
postings
on
an
ebb
are
probably
not
.
