the
records
and
reports
that
the
epa
considers
necessary
for
demonstrating
initial
and
continuous
compliance
for
this
source
category
are
summarized
in
table
5
.
(
the
selection
of
reporting
and
recordkeeping
requirements
is
further
discussed
in
section
vih
)
reports
identified
under
initial
compliance
methods
in
table
5
are
required
to
be
submitted
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
§
639h
)
of
subpart
a
,
the
general
provisions
to
part
63
.
information
that
should
be
included
in
the
initial
compliance
report
is
identified
in
table
5
.
in
order
to
perform
the
emission
calculations
,
a
source
must
by
necessity
keep
records
of
the
quantity
of
finishing
material
used
over
each
month
,
and
the
vhap
and
solids
content
of
these
finishing
materials
(
see
table
6
.
an
affected
source
demonstrates
continuous
compliance
if
finishing
materials
,
thinners
,
adhesives
,
and
spray
booth
materials
meeting
the
limits
in
the
proposed
rule
are
used
.
if
a
source
at
any
time
uses
a
material
that
does
not
meet
these
limits
(
unless
the
source
is
using
an
averaging
approach
or
is
subject
to
the
special
compliance
provisions
for
coatings
applied
with
continuous
coaters
,
the
source
is
out
of
compliance
with
the
rule
.
a
source
that
complies
with
emission
limits
for
finishing
operations
by
achieving
an
average
hap
limit
across
all
finishing
steps
is
in
compliance
if
,
over
each
month
,
the
hap
limit
required
by
the
proposed
rule
is
met
.
the
committee
agreed
that
a
monthly
averaging
period
was
appropriate
for
this
source
category
because
,
at
many
facilities
,
manufacturing
operations
change
from
weektoweek
week
to
week
or
even
daytoday
day
to
day
.
the
compliance
timeframe
of
a
month
that
is
identified
in
the
proposed
rule
accounts
for
this
variation
,
and
allows
a
source
flexibility
in
performing
manufacturing
operations
.
the
committee
did
not
think
that
there
would
be
any
adverse
environmental
impact
by
choosing
a
monthly
compliance
period
.
it
was
agreed
that
throughout
the
month
,
a
source
would
not
be
likely
to
exceed
the
hap
limit
by
a
considerable
amount
.
if
it
did
,
they
would
have
difficulty
in
meeting
the
monthly
limit
.
if
a
source
does
not
meet
the
hap
limit
over
any
monthly
period
,
it
is
out
of
compliance
with
the
rule
for
each
operating
day
of
the
month
unless
the
source
can
demonstrate
through
records
that
the
violation
of
the
monthly
average
can
be
attributed
to
a
particular
day
or
days
of
operation
.
further
,
periods
of
startup
,
shutdown
,
and
malfunction
should
be
included
when
determining
compliance
when
methods
other
than
control
devices
are
used
to
meet
the
emission
limits
.
startup
,
shutdown
,
and
malfunction
periods
are
included
because
the
use
of
compliant
coatings
should
not
be
affected
during
these
periods
.
semiannual
reporting
,
in
addition
to
recordkeeping
,
is
necessary
to
document
the
compliance
status
of
the
affected
source
.
a
source
using
compliant
finishing
materials
,
thinners
,
adhesives
,
or
strippable
spray
booth
coatings
must
submit
a
semiannual
compliance
certification
that
states
compliant
materials
are
being
used
.
a
source
using
an
averaging
approach
must
provide
copies
of
each
months
emission
calculation
and
submit
a
semiannual
compliance
certification
that
states
that
the
value
of
(
e
,
as
calculated
by
equation
1
of
§
63
804
,
is
no
greater
than
1
for
existing
sources
or
08
for
new
sources
.
the
agency
has
identified
semiannual
reporting
for
this
source
category
,
except
for
sources
that
experience
excess
emissions
and
are
using
a
control
device
to
comply
with
the
proposed
rule
.
for
these
sources
,
continuous
monitoring
system
data
are
used
directly
for
determining
compliance
.
sources
with
a
control
device
that
experience
excess
emissions
must
follow
a
quarterly
reporting
format
for
at
least
1
year
after
the
excess
emissions
occur
and
until
a
request
to
reduce
reporting
frequency
is
approved
.
this
is
consistent
with
guidance
provided
in
the
general
provisions
,
subpart
a
,
63
10
.
in
addition
,
if
the
administrator
finds
significant
industrywide
industry
wide
noncompliance
with
the
rule
,
the
administrator
may
require
that
semiannual
reporting
be
changed
to
quarterly
reporting
.
the
agency
considered
small
business
impacts
when
developing
the
compliance
and
monitoring
provisions
and
decided
that
more
frequent
reporting
for
those
sources
that
are
routinely
complying
with
the
rule
would
not
be
necessary
for
small
businesses
.
