alternate

differential

may
include
primary

based

of

,
or
modification
of

data
by
scanning

a

of
experience
is
required
to
routinely
and
correctly
perform
differential
counting
.
it
is
discouraged
unless
it
is
legally
necessary
.
then
,
only
if
a
fiber
is
obviously
not
asbestos
should
it
be
excluded
from
the
count
.

these

this
