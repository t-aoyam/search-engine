effect
on
small
entities
the
administrator
has
determined
that
this
proposed
rule
would
not
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
,
as
defined
by
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
(
5
usc
.
601
.
it
is
likely
that
producers
with
smaller
lot
sizes
would
have
higher
compliance
costs
per
pound
of
product
because
some
costs
such
as
testing
and
recordkeeping
occur
on
a
lot
basis
.
any
relabeling
costs
also
would
be
lower
per
pound
for
products
with
large
annual
production
.

control
,
and
to
make
such
records
available
to
any
duly
authorized
representative
of
the
secretary
.
this
proposed
rule
would
also
require
labels
of
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
(
ie
,
products
currently
termed
mechanically
deboned
poultry
or
mdp
)

the
