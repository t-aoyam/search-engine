fda
found

like
the
nitroglycerin
regulation
,
this
proposed
regulation
regarding
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
is
intended
to
address
a
public
health
problem
that
,
fda
has
tentatively
concluded
,
can
be
alleviated
by
requiring
specific
packaging
.
as
was
the
case
with
nitroglycerin
before
fda
required
specific
packaging
,
iron
-
containing
products
are
not
safe
as
currently
packaged
.
fda
has
tentatively
determined
that
it
is
necessary
to
prohibit
repackaging
by
pharmacists
in
order
to
protect
product
integrity
and
to
provide
the
greatest
assurance
that
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
will
be
used
safely
and
as
intended
.
fda
recognizes
that
pregnant
women
can
receive
their
iron
supplements
by
way
of
thirdparty
third
party
reimbursement
,
which
generally
requires
that
a
health
care
professional
prescribe
the
supplements
.
these
women
present
their
prescriptions
to
pharmacists
who
,
often
,
repackage
iron
dietary
supplements
in
pharmacy
vials
.
fda
recognizes
the
vital
importance
of
iron
supplements
to
prenatal
health
care
and
emphasizes
that
the
proposed
rule
should
not
diminish
the
availability
of
iron
tablets
to
pregnant
women
or
to
any
other
patient
population
.
fda
expects
that
pharmacists
will
dispense
the
tablets
in
their
original
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
.
under
the
proposed
rule
,
pharmacists
would
be
free
to
dispense
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
in
the
manufacturers
box
,
or
in
any
other
outer
container
,
as
long
as
the
original
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
remained
intact
.
fda
does
not
believe
that
the
proposed
mandatory
packaging
and
labeling
regulation
will
encroach
upon
the
practice
of
pharmacy
.
under
the
proposed
requirement
,
products
will
reach
the
pharmacy
in
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
with
a
warning
statement
printed
directly
on

wrapping
or
container
.
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
such
a
requirement
,
rather
than
representing
an
encroachment
on
the
practice
of
pharmacy
,
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
consumers
receive
adequate
warning

the
serious
dangers

iron

that
look

avoiding

ndma
asked
fda
to
reject
the
recommendation
from
the
ag

for
several
reasons
.
first
,
ndma
stated
that
`
candy
can
beand
ismade
to
look
like
just
about
any
other
consumable
product
.
once
a
supplement
manufacturer
decides
on
a
shape
,
size
,
colorof
which
there
are
limited
selectionsfor
a
supplement
product
,
a
candy
manufacturer
could
choose
independently
to
introduce
a
candy
that
looks
like
that
dietary
supplement
'
second
,
ndma
stated
that
it
is
not
known
what
a
pill
looks
like
to
a
very
young
child
.
`
a
very
young
child
puts
everything
into
his
or
her
mouth
,
and
in
fact
there
are
no
hard
data
to
say
that
candylike
candy
like
appearance
is
why
a
very
young
child
chooses
to
investigate
a
consumable
consumer
product
.
it
is
quite
likely
that
it
may
be
even
more
important
that
the
very
young
child
sees
his
or
her
mother
take
that
pill
every
day
'
third
,
ndma
asserted
that
candylike
candy
like
appearance
is
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder
and
is
simply
too
subjective
a
standard
.
it
would
be
impossible
to
have
an
objective
measure
of
candylike
candy
like
appearance
.
thus
,
ndma
stated
that
any
provision
for
`
no
candy
-
like
appearance
'
would
not
be
practical
and
would
be
difficult
to
administer
because
of
the
subjective
nature
of
assessing
candylike
candy
like
appearance
