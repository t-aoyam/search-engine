based
upon
the
studies
and
practices
noted
above
,
the
fhwa
has
determined
that
three
years
safe
driving
experience
with
the
vision
deficiency
not
only
allowed
for
sufficient
adjustment
by
drivers
to
the
condition
,
but
also
provided
for
the
longest
period
of
experience
for
which
records
were
uniformly
available
from
which
to
predict
future
performance
.
as
noted
above
,
the
california
study
was
limited
to
a
twoyear
two
year
base
period
because
,
like
many
jurisdictions
,
the
accumulation
of
accurate
driver
histories
does
not
exceed
three
years
.
the
use
of
a
threeyear
three
year
base
period
improves
the
predictability
of
the
future
period
because
the
longer
the
period
,
the
more
likely
the
elimination
of
random
anomalies
.

)
therefore
,
the
fhwa
believes
it
has
required
and
applied
a
sufficiently
long
period
of
safe
driving
to
project
continued
safe
driving
over
a
future
period
of
the
same
duration
.
the
fhwa
accepted
only
those
drivers
with
no
chargeable
accidents
for
the
threeyear
three
year
period
of
most
recent
driving
experience
.
this
translated
into
no
chargeable
accidents
,
as
verified
through
motor
vehicle
records
,
in
approximately
300
million
vehicle
miles
travelled
(
vmt
,
as
reported
by
the
applicants
.
although
the
fhwa
certainly
could
not
conclude
that
this
rate
would
remain
at
zero
,
some
of
the
studies
noted
above
concluded
that
the
correlation
between
the
accident
experience
of
the
same
individual
over
two
different
time
periods
was
strongest
when
the
rate
of
accidents
was
lowest
.
moreover
,
the
fhwa
is
confident
that
the
chargeable
accident
rate
of
the
general
commercial
driving
population
over
three
years
could
not
be
less
than
0
.
in
fact
,
the
chargeable
accident
rate
for
the
year
1991
,
the
year
prior
to
the
inception
of
the
vision
study
,
for
the
general
truck
driving
population
was
0
46
per
1
million
vmt
.
if
the
waived
drivers
were
not
permitted
to
continue
to
drive
,
they
would
have
to
be
replaced
by
other
drivers
.
these
`
replacement
'
drivers
come
from
the
general
commercial
driving
population
,
which
includes
new
,
inexperienced
commercial
drivers
.
the
fhwa
has
established
that
the
chargeable
accident
rate
for
the
general
commercial
driving
population
for
the
year
1992
well
exceeds
that
of
the
drivers
participating
in
the
vision
waiver
program
.
information
about
the
past
performance
of
new
,
inexperienced
commercial
drivers
,
many
of
whom
are
younger
in
age
,
does
not
exist
.
studies
have
shown
,
however
,
that
younger
drivers
of
passenger
vehicles
produce
the
highest
accident
rates
.
consequently
,
the
agency
required
a
threeyear
three
year
experience
factor
for
applicants
to
the
waiver
program
as
a
means
of
eliminating
a
similar
risk
posed
by
inexperienced
commercial
drivers
.

1979
.
the
good
driving
record
demonstrated
by
the
waiver
applicants
not
only
required
the
absence
of
chargeable
accidents
over
a
threeyear
three
year
period
,
but
also
the
absence
of
serious
traffic
violations
and
no
more
than
two
minor
traffic
violations
.
according
to
the
california
driver
record
study
mentioned
above
,
this
is
the
best
predictor
of
future
safe
driving
.
the
requirement
of
three
years
safe
driving
experience
with
the
vision
deficit
severely
limited
participation
by
the
highest
accidentrisk
accident
risk
age
group
.
each
drivers
application
was
individually
examined
,
any
missing
information
was
required
to
be
furnished
,
and
each
driver
was
measured
against
the
waiver
standards
to
assure
that
all
the
conditions
were
met
,
ie
,
individualized
determinations
were
made
on
the
basis
of
complete
data
submitted
by
each
applicant
,
to
determine
eligibility
for
participation
in
the
waiver
program
.
