as

above
in
the
discussion
of
fsiss
tentative
position
regarding
the
definition
and
standard
for
mdp
,
fsis
is
considering
that
in
view
of
the
differences
between
mdp
and
poultry
products
produced
by
traditional
handdeboning
hand
deboning
techniques
and
the
developments
since
its
introduction
,
mdp
should
be
regulated
as
a
distinctive
ingredient
with
standardized
characteristics
.
therefore
,
it
is
fsiss
tentative
position
to
define
such
product
by
its
own
name
,
eg
,
`
mechanically
separated
(
kind
'
that
would
be
declared
in
the
ingredient
statements
on
finished
product
labels
by
the
name
specified
in
its
definition
and
standard
.
fsis
recognizes
the
importance
of
the
identification
of
the
calcium
and
cholesterol
content
of
mdp
to
consumers
who
,
according
to
the
comments
received
on
the
06/15/1993
,
anpr
,
indicated
a
desire
to
know
of
the
presence
of
calcium
and
cholesterol
.
fsis
wishes
to
point
out
that
the
effective
date
for
its
mandatory
nutrition
labeling
regulations
(

is
07/06/1994
.
these
rules
require
mandatory
declaration
of
calcium
and
cholesterol
content
on
most
processed
meat
and
poultry
products
which
will
address
this
particular
labeling
concern
.
fsis
believes
that
nutrition
labeling
is
the
most
appropriate
vehicle
for
conveying
a
products
nutrient
content
,
which
includes
calcium
,
cholesterol
as
well
as

information

fsis
is
considering
amending
its
current
boneless
poultry
regulations
to
allow
boneless
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
to
be
classified
as
poultry
or
poultry
meat
if
produced
under
the
provisions
of
a
quality
control
program
that
would
require
compliance
with
certain
criteria
for
this
product
,
eg
,
protein
quality
,
bone

(
calcium
,
and
bone

fsis
is
also
considering
having
handling
requirements
and
limitations
on
use
of
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less

solids
in
certain
products
.
further
,
fsis
is
considering
that
protein
and
fat
content
requirements
would
not
be
necessary
,
for
such
products
,
because
protein
and
fat
are
nutrients
whose
declaration
becomes
mandatory
on
the
labeling
of
most

and
poultry
products
when

tentative
position
:
product
name
and
labeling
.
fsis
is
contemplating
amending
the
labeling
regulations
on
boneless
poultry
products
to
change
the
allowable
bone
content
for
products
currently
labeled
as
poultry
or
poultry
meat
.
the
mechanical
deboning
machinery
used
to
produce
boneless
poultry
products
has
undergone
significant
changes
since
1969
.
over
the
years
,
there
have
been
continued
refinements
in
certain
parameters
,
eg
,
the
ability
to
adjust
the
pressure
and
aperture
size
,
resulting
in
far
less
than
current
allowance
of
no
more
than
one
percent
bone
solids
for
mechanically
deboned
poultry
.
according
to
an
august
1993
study
done
by
fsis
regarding
bone
content
of
boneless
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
deboning
,
the
average
bone
solids
content
was
approximately
06
percent
.
the
changes
in
mechanical
deboning
machinery
have
resulted
in
improved
manufacturing
processes
.
we
believe
it
results
in
products
which
are
comparable
to
`
poultry
'
and
`
poultry
meat
'
derived
from
handdeboning
hand

fsis
is
considering
provisions
that
will
enable
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
to
be
classified
as
poultry
or
poultry
meat
and
labeled
accordingly
.
it
is
fsiss
tentative
view
that
these
products
need
not
be
labeled
to
describe
their
form
(
ie
,
consistency
)
by
terms
such
as
`
emulsified
'
and
`
finely
chopped
'
fsis
believes
that
the
form
of
the
product
may
not
be
important
because
these
products
are
primarily
used
as
ingredients
in
poultry
and
meat
products
,
such
as
poultry
sausages
,
which
are
themselves
categorized
as
finished
products
that
are
`
emulsified
'
`
finely
chopped
'
etc
,
in
terms
of
texture
.
therefore
,
fsis
wishes
to
receive
comments
on
whether
there
is
a
need
to
include
the
term
used
to
describe
the
form
of
the
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
,
eg
,
`
emulsified
'
`
finely
ground
'
etc
,
in
the
ingredients
statement
of
the
product
in
which
such
product
is
used
as
an
ingredient
and
whether
these
terms
are
important
to
the
consumer
.
