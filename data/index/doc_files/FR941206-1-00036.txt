background
section
182d1a
)
of
the
act
,
as
amended
in
1990
(
act
,
requires
states
containing
ozone
nonattainment
areas
classified
as
`
severe
'
pursuant
to
section
181a
)
of
the
act
to
adopt
transportation
control
measures
(
tcms
)
and
transportation
control
strategies
to
offset
any
growth
in
emissions
from
growth
in
vmt
or
number
of
vehicle
trips
,
and
to
attain
reductions
in
motor
vehicle
emissions
(
in
combination
with
other
emission
reduction
requirements
)
as
necessary
to
comply
with
the
acts
rfp
milestones
and
attainment
requirements
.
the
requirements
for
establishing
a
vmt
offset
program
are
discussed
in
the
04/16/1992
,
general
preamble
to
title
i
of
the
act
(
57
fr
13498
,
in
addition
to
section
182d1a
)
of
the
act
.
for
certain
programs
required
under
the
act
(
including
vmtoffset
vmt
offset
,
usepa
had
earlier
adopted
a
policy
pursuant
to
section
110k4
)
of
the
act
to
conditionally
approve
sips
that
committed
to
provide
the
usepa
with
specific
enforceable
measures
by
a
date
certain
.
that
interpretation
was
challenged
in
natural
resources
defense
council
v
.
browner
,
,
consolidated
lawsuits
brought
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
.
in
a
full
opinion
,
dated
05/06/1994
(
and
in
a
03/08/1994
order
and
04/22/1994
amended
order
issued
earlier
)
the
court
found
that
usepas
conditional
approval
interpretation
exceeded
usepas
statutory
authority
.
while
the
court
did
not
specifically
address
the
vmt
offset
program
in
its
orders
or
opinions
,
usepa
believes
that
the
courts
general
conclusion
that
the
agencys
construction
of
the
conditional
approval
provision
was
unlawful
precludes
usepa
from
taking
action
to
approve
any
submitted
vmt
offset
committal
sips
.
on
11/26/1993
,
the
usepa
published
a
proposed
rule
(
58
fr
62309
)
to
conditionally
approve
illinoiss
commitment
for
the
vmtoffset
vmt
offset
requirement
.
in
light
of
the
decision
reached
in
natural
resources
defense
council
v
.
browner
,
,
usepa
has
decided
not
to
go
forward
with
conditional
approvals
of
vmt
committal
sips
,
but
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
interpret
the
vmt
offset
provision
of
the
act
to
account
for
how
states
can
practicably
comply
with
each
of
the
provisions
elements
.
the
vmt
offset
provision
requires
that
states
submit
by
11/15/1992
,
specific
enforceable
tcms
and
strategies
to
offset
any
growth
in
emissions
from
growth
in
vmt
or
number
of
vehicle
trips
,
sufficient
to
allow
total
area
emissions
to
comply
with
the
rfp
and
attainment
requirements
of
the
act
.
