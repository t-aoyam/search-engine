fsis
is
considering
proposing
a
requirement
that
the
protein
in
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
have
a
protein
quality
value
that
is
a
protein
digestibilitycorrected
digestibility
corrected
amino
acid
score
of
not
less
than
40
expressed
as
a
percent
.
this
value
is
consistent
with
nutrition
labeling
requirements
for
protein
in
foods
for
children
older
than
one
but
less
than
four
years
of
age
,
as
provided
in
21
cfr
1019c7
,
which
is
crossreferenced

referenced
in
its
final
nutrition
regulations
(

)
in

.
fsis
believes
this
value
protects
the
young
consumer
from
inadequate
nutrition
and
from
the
use
of
poor
quality
protein
(
ie
,
protein
that
does
not
meet
the
dietary
needs
for
growth
,
and
in
turn
,
protects
people
other
than
young
consumers
.
fsis
is
also
considering
that
it
is
appropriate
to
assure
comparability
of
boneless
poultry
products
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
with
poultry
that
is
derived
by
handdeboning

in

to
human
dietary
needs
to
maintain

integrity
of

supply
.
fsis
is
proposing
to
permit
an
alternative
measurement
to
the
protein
digestibilitycorrected
digestibility
corrected
amino
acid
score
method
,
which
requires
a
digestibility
measurement
in
addition
to
an
amino
acid
analysis
,
to
control
the
cost
of
monitoring
compliance
with
the
protein
quality
requirement
.
fsis
is
considering
proposing
that
,
for
the
purpose
of
measuring
the
protein
quality
of
boneless
poultry
with
06
or
less
bone
solids
,
an
alternative
measurement
of
protein
quality
would
be
allowed
that
is
comparable
to
the
protein
digestibilitycorrected
digestibility
corrected
amino
acid
score
.
this
measure
would
be
based
on
a
comparison
between
the
`
essential
amino
acid
content
of
boneless
poultry
'
and
`
total
amino
acids
present
in
boneless
poultry
'
essential
amino

content
includes
isoleucine
,
leucine
,
lysine
,
methionine
,
phenylalanine
,
threonine
,
and
valine
content
,
and
the
total

present
including

,
aspartic
acid
,
glutamic
acid
,
glycine
,
proline
,

,
and
hydroxyproline
content
.
it
is
being
considered
that
the
essential
amino
acid
content
would
be
determined
by
methods
given
in
the
`
protein
quality
evaluation

'
fsis
believes
that
boneless
poultry
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
found
to
be
in
compliance
by
the
proposed
amino
acid
content
measurement
would
have
protein
of
high
quality
.
this
belief
is
supported
by
the
198283
evaluation
of
an
expert
work
group
that
was
organized
by
