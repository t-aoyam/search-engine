the
second
issue
associated
with
the
use
of
cotinine
as
a
biomarker
is
the
possibility
that
there
is
a
longer
halflife
half
life
for
the
elimination
of
cotinine
at
very
low
biological
concentrations
,
associated
with
the
slow

of
nicotine
from
binding
sites

this
longer
halflife
half
life
at
very
low
concentrations
could
have
the
effect
of
overestimating
exposure
to
ets
in
the
lowest
exposed
population
.
at
this
time
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
to
quantify
the
potential
magnitude
of
this
effect

it

an

for
investigating
some
of
the
concerns
associated
with
the
use
of
cotinine
as
a
biomarker
,
however
,
a
physiologically
based
pharmacokinetic
(
pbpk
)
description
would
be
preferred
.
the
advantage
of
the
pbpk
approach
stems
from
its
biologically
motivated
structure
,
which
permits
the
direct
incorporation
of
biochemical
data
and
the
biologically
constrained
comparison
of
model

with
experimental
timecourses
to

such
issues

pbpk
models
of
nicotine
and

have
been
described
for
both
rats

a
physiological
model
of
cotinine
disposition
[

was
developed
to
analyze
intravenous
infusion
of
nicotine
and
cotinine
and
bolus
dosing
of
cotinine
in
rats
.
in
general
,
the
observed
cotinine
time
profiles
in
blood
and
tissues
were
consistent
with
linear
kinetics
,
but
the
distribution
of
cotinine
into
all
tissues
appeared
to
be
roughly
threefold
three
fold
greater
following
infusion
of
nicotine
than
following
infusion
of
cotinine
,
and
the
clearance
of
cotinine
following
bolus
and
infusion
dosing
was
significantly
different
.
a
more
recent
rat
model
[
ex

255
]
featured
a
physiologically
based
description
of
nicotine
kinetics
and
a
compartmental
description
of
cotinine
.
this
model
provided
a
successful
description
of
the
plasma
kinetics
of
both
nicotine
and
cotinine
for
intraarterial
or
intravenous
bolus
dosing
of
nicotine
.
the
timecourse
of
nicotine
in
most
tissues
was
also
consistent
with
first
order
kinetics
;
however
,
it
was
necessary
to
include
a
description
of
saturable
nicotine
binding
in
the
brain
,
heart
,
and
lung
to
adequately
reproduce
nicotine
concentration
profiles
in
these
tissues
.
this
rat
model
has
also
been
scaled
for
use
in
predicting
mouse
and
human
pharmacokinetics
[
ex

4254
.
the
human
model
has
recently
been
expanded
to
include
a
physiological
description
of
cotinine
as
well
as
a
forearm
compartment
,
and
is
now
able
to
describe
nicotine
and
cotinine
kinetics
following
intravenous
infusion
of
nicotine
in
humans
[

another
human
model
[
ex

4270
]
has
also
been
developed
which
includes
physiological
descriptions
of
both
nicotine
and
cotinine
.
this
model
,
which
assumes
linear
kinetics
,
predicts
results
which
agree
with
published
data
on
the
kinetics
of
nicotine
and
cotinine
in
blood
following
nicotine
infusion
as
well
as
cotinine
in
the
blood

the
infusion
of

application
of
pharmacokinetic
modeling
for
ets
exposure
estimation
both
of
the
human
models
described
above
possess
a
reasonable
biologically
based
structure
,
and
either
model
would
provide
a
useful
starting
point
for
the
development
of
a
pbpk
model
which
could
be
of
use
in
examining
the
relationship
between
cotinine
concentrations
in
body
fluids
and
inhaled
nicotine
.
however
,
neither
of
the
models
currently
possesses
all
of
the
features
which
would
be
necessary
for
such
an
analysis
.
the
most
useful
application
of
pbpk
modeling
would
appear
to
be
to
support
an
analysis
of
four
issues
related
to
the
use
of
cotinine
as
a
biomarker
of
ets
exposure
:
(
1
)
estimation
of
the
contribution
of
dietary
intake
of
nicotine
to
cotinine
levels
in
the
plasma
,
saliva
and
urine
of
nonsmokers
;
(

)
estimation
of
a
plausible
upper
bound
for
cotinine
concentrations
in
plasma
,
saliva
and
urine
associated
with
ets
exposure
(
to
identify
individuals
wrongfully
identifying
themselves
as
nonsmokers
.
this
can
be
viewed
as
a
way
to
validate
misclassification
results
derived
from
surveys
;
(

)
evaluation
of
the
potential
impact
of
high
affinity
,
low
capacity
binding
of
nicotine
and
cotinine
in
nonsmokers
with
low
exposure
to
ets
;
and
(

)
evaluation
of
the
potential
impact
of
pharmacokinetic
uncertainty
and
variability
on
the
use
of
cotinine
concentrations
in
plasma
,
saliva
or
urine
to
infer
an
individuals
ets
exposure
.
the
necessary
features
for
accomplishing
these
analyses
include
both
inhalation
and
oral
routes
of
nicotine
exposure
,
a
salivary
compartment
,
and
a
description
of
nicotine
binding
in
the
brain
,
heart
and
lung
.
in
evaluating
the
use
of
cotinine
as
a
biomarker
of
ets
exposure
,
two
kinds
of
uncertainty
must
be
considered
.
the
first
kind
of
uncertainty
embraces
those
factors
which
could
tend
to
bias
a
risk
estimate
.
two
such
factors
are
dietary
intake
of
nicotine
and
nicotine
binding
.
in
both
of
these
cases
,
the
impact
of
ignoring
the
effect
,
if
it
were
significant
,
would
be
to
overestimate
exposure
(
and
therefore
risk
)
for
the
least
exposed
individuals
.
the
second
kind
of
uncertainty
includes
those
factors
which
tend
to
broaden
the
confidence
interval
for
the
risk
estimate
.
the
most
significant
factors
in
this
category
are
uncertainty
in
the
fraction
of
nicotine
converted
to
free
cotinine
,
and
the
rates
of
metabolic
and
urinary
clearance
of
nicotine
and
cotinine
.
an
example
of
such
uncertainty
is
results
reported
for
halflives
half
lives
of
cotinine
in
nonsmokers
[
ex
.

,

,

,

mean
of

analysis
of
uncertainty
it
is
useful
in
this
evaluation
to
distinguish
uncertainty
from
variability
.
as
it
relates
to
the
issue
of
using
pharmacokinetic
modeling
in
risk
assessment
,
uncertainty
can
be
defined
as
the
possible
error
in
estimating
the
`
true
'
value
of
a
parameter
for
a
representative
(
average
)
individual
.
variability
,
on
the
other
hand
,
represents
differences
from
individual
to
individual
.
for
the
purpose
of
evaluating
the
usefulness
of
pharmacokinetic
modeling
for
estimating
exposure
,
the
uncertainty
and
variability
in
the
various
parameters
for
the
pharmacokinetic
models
can
be
grouped
into
four
classes
:
the
physiological
parameters
(
volumes
and
flows
,
the
tissue
distribution
parameters
(
partitioning
and
binding
,
and
the
kinetic
parameters
(
absorption
,
metabolism
,
and
clearance
.
