the

to

the

'
this
subpart
establishes
policies
and
requirements
for
irps
and
dsm
plans
.
many
of
these
requirements
are
new
,
although
existing
§
1710
253
and
1710
254
,
and
existing
subparts
e
and
g
,
set
forth
analytical
and
related
requirements
for
the
financing
of
most
generation
facilities
that
are
the
same
in
many
respects
to
the
requirements
of
an
irp
.
given
the
expansion
of
rea
lending
authority
in
the
relatively
new
and
sometimes
uncertain
areas
of
dsm
and
renewable
energy
systems
,
it
is
essential
that
borrowers
make
their
investment
decisions
based
on
an
irp
in
order
to
ensure
informed
and
prudent
investment
planning
.
if
a
distribution
borrower
is
a
member
of
a
power
supply
borrower
,
its
requests
for
dsm
loans
must
be
based
on
and
be
consistent
with
the
irp
of
the
power
supply
borrower
.
the
irp
of
the
power
supply
borrower
will
establish
which
dsm
programs
,
ongrid
on
grid
renewable
energy
systems
,
and
traditional
utility
investments
,
among
several
feasible
alternatives
,
are
most
costbeneficial
cost
beneficial
from
the
standpoint
of
the
power
supply
borrower
and
its
members
taken
as
an
integrated
system
.
the
dsm
programs
of
the
individual
distribution
members
must
be
coordinated
among
all
parties
to
ensure
that
the
dsm
programs
of
one
member
do
not
jeopardize
the
financial
integrity
and
loan
security
of
any
other
member
or
that
of
the
power
supply
borrower
.
although
dsm
must
be
implemented
at
the
distribution
level
,
a
significant
portion
of
the
benefits
and
costs
of
dsm
are
accrued
at
the
power
supply
level
.
these
benefits
and
costs
are
then
transferred
to
the
distribution
borrower
through
wholesale
rates
.
consequently
,
dsm
planning
by
distribution
borrowers
must
consider
the
impacts
of
their
activities
on
their
power
supplier
and
the
implications
of
the
power
suppliers
wholesale
rates
.
because
of
the
relationship
between
a
power
supply
borrower
and
its
members
and
the
relationship
among
the
members
of
a
power
supply
borrower
,
it
is
imperative
that
the
power
supply
borrower
and
its
members
coordinate
irp
activities

§
1710
356
)
of
this
interim
rule
.
if
a
distribution
borrower
is
not
a
member
of
a
power
supply
borrower
,
loan
requests
for
dsm
programs
and
ongrid
on
grid
renewable
energy
systems
must
be
supported
by
the
borrowers
own
irp
.
the
irp
must
address
,
in
particular
,
any
effects
its
dsm
programs
will
have
on
the
wholesale
power
rates
charged
by
its
nonrea
rea
financed
power
supplier
.
the
requirements
set
forth
for
dsm
plans
and
irps
are
intended
to
provide
guidance
as
these
new
requirements
are
implemented
.
since
these
areas
are
new
in
many
respects
,
rea
intends
to
exercise
its
discretion
to
administer
the
specific
requirements
and
procedures
with
a
prudent
degree
of
flexibility
,
especially
during
the
first
several
months
of
implementation

comments
from
the
public
are
invited
regarding
the
policies
and
requirements
set
forth
herein
for
dsm

this
interim
regulation

it
