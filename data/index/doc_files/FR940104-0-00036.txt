had
proposed

of

met
,
that
is
,
the

tentatively
concluded
that
there
was
not
significant
scientific
agreement
,
based
on
the
totality
of
publicly
available
scientific
evidence
that
these
claims
are
valid
.

the
dietary
supplement
act
of
1992
in
10/19/1992
,
the

was
enacted

this
statute
imposed
a
moratorium
on
fdas
implementation
of
the
1990
amendments
with
respect
to
dietary
supplements
until
12/15/1993
(
although
the
ds
act
did
provide
that
fda
could
authorize
claims
for
dietary
supplements
before
that
date
.
the
ds
act
directed
fda
to
issue
proposed
rules
to
implement
the
1990
amendments
with
respect
to
dietary
supplements
by
06/15/1993

and
to
issue
final
rules
based
on
these
proposals
by
12/31/1993

the

also
amended

called
`
hammer
'
provision
of
the
1990

section

of
the
1990

provide
that
if
the

did
not
meet
the
established

timeframe
for
issuance
of

the

three
of

authorized

thus
these
