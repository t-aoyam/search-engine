various
reasons
were
advanced
for
the
presence
of
elevated
exposure
levels
within
negative
pressure
enclosures
.
thus
dr
.
sawyer
testified
`
i
have
seen
configurations
that
not
only
dont
work
maintaining
the
enclosure
integrity
,
but
they
actually
can
increase
fiber
burdens
in
the
contamination
area

(
this
involves

a
hepa
filter
by
itself
without
a
drive
mechanism
,
without
a
fan
to
force
air
through
it

`
i
can
anecdotally
tell
you
what
ive
seen
out
there
,
but
a
lot
of
the
systems
just
dont
work
,
and
some
of
them
can
actually
increase
the
hazard
to
workers

in
view
of
the
disparity
in
the
submitted
data
,
osha
concludes
that
negative
pressure
enclosure
systems
,
like
other
control
systems
which
depend
on
proper
installation
,
design
and
supervision
for
effectiveness
,
can
vary
in
protection
they
afford
to
employees
working
within
.
unlike
engineering
systems
permanently
installed
which
are
capitalized
by
the
facility
owner
,
negative
pressure
systems
are
installed
for
the
duration
of
the
job
,
and
economic
pressures
are
exerted
to
hold
down
the
time
and
cost
of
the
installation
.
thus
,
the
support
for
the
use
of
npes
to
reduce
employee
exposure
is
mixed
.
osha
is
also
concerned
that
other
health
and
safety
hazards
may
result
from
work
in
negative
pressure
enclosure
systems
.
for
example
,
problems
with
toxic
adhesives
were
noted
in
the
record
.
levels
of
methylene
chloride
,
used
to
seal
poly
sheeting
to
underlying
surfaces
to
contain
work
areas
have
been
measured
at
over
the
pel
for
that
substance
(
ex
.
124
.
some
of
the
polyethylene
used
for
sheeting
may
be
combustible
(
ex
.
718
.
certain
industries
reported
particular
hazards
of
npes
.
for
example
,
a
representative
of
arco
products
co
.
commented
that
in
the
gasoline
industry
hazards
included
:
buildup
build
of
gases
inside
the
enclosure
,
heat
stress
,
fire
hazards
,
lack
of
good
ventilation
,
difficulty
in
working
with
mobile
equipment
,
difficulties
in
communicating
and
exiting
during
emergencies
(
ex
.
7139
.
various
solutions
to
these
problem
were
suggested
.
thus
,
it
was
suggested
that
less
toxic
adhesives
be
substituted
for
methylene
chloride
;
that
poly
sheets
can
be
attached
without
adhesives
(
bctd
,
ex
.
143
;
that
heat
stress
be
eliminated
by
increasing
the
number
of
air
changes
per
hour
within
the
enclosure
;
that
a
transparent
window
be
installed
in
each
enclosure
to
facilitate
communication
(
ex
.
76
;
and
other
such
adaptations
.
certain
of
these
suggestions
were
criticized
as
ineffective
.
for
example
,
union
carbide
stated
in
its
posthearing
hearing
submission
,
`
we
have
observed
that
even
when
8
to
12
air
changes
per
hour
are
provided
to
the
enclosure
,
on
certain
days
the
inside
of
the
enclosure
temperature
has
risen
as
high
as
140
degrees
f
.
the
heat
stress
situation
is
further
exacerbated
by
the
body
coveralls
worn
by
the
workers
