exemptions
the
transportation
conformity
rule
states
that
its
no
provisions
do
not
apply
when
the
administrator
has
determined
under
section
182f
)
of
the
clean
air
act
that
`
additional
reductions
of
no
would
not
contribute
to
attainment
'
although
two
other
passages
of
the
transportation
conformity
rule
use
this
language
(
which
is
borrowed
from
section
182f1as
test
for
areas
outside
an
ozone
transport
region
)
without
specifically
referring
to
section
182f
,
epa
believes
there
is
no
appropriate
basis
to
interpret
this
identical
language
differently
under
the
transportation
conformity
rule
than
under
the
clean
air
act
.
consequently
,
epa
believes
this
common
language
should
be
interpreted
similarly
for
purposes
of
both
section

)
and
conformity
no
exemptions
.
therefore
,
epa
is
providing
guidance
which
would
exempt
nonclassifiable
ozone
nonattainment
areas
outside
an
ozone
transport
region
from
the
conformity
rules
no
provisions
on
the
same
substantive
basis
as

test

of
the
05/27/1994
memorandum
from
john
seitz
,
referenced
above
,
for
purposes
of
the
no
exemption
test
,
epa
is
interpreting
the
term
`
contribute
to
attainment
'
to
mean
that
the
state
(
or
petitioner
)
need
only
show
whether
additional
no
reductions
would
contribute
to
attainment
,
not
whether
such
reductions
would
contribute
to
attainment
and
maintenance
.
epa
believes
that
congress
could
reasonably
have
believed
it
appropriate
to
require
that
states
impose
reasonably
available
control
technology
(
ract
)
and
new
source
review
(
nsr
)
requirements
on
no
sources
for
areas
in
nonattainment
,
but
that
the
states
could
be
left
to
decide
for
themselves
whether
to
impose
these
no
controls
or
other
measures
for
maintenance
purposes
,
even
if
these
controls
could
`
contribute
'
to
maintenance
.
epa
believes
this
rationale
also
applies
in
the
conformity
context
,
where
epa
believes
it
is
reasonable
to
allow
states
that
have
attained
the
naaqs
to
decide
for
themselves
how
best
to
ensure
maintenance
of
the
standard
.
and
,
as
explained
below
,
epa
has
conditioned
the
monitoringbased
monitoring
based
section
182f
)
and
conformity
exemptions
on
continued
monitoring
data
that
do
not
show
violations
of
the
naaqs
.
this
will
provide
an
additional
incentive
for
states
to
track
no
emissions
(
and
limit
such
emissions
,
where
necessary
)
to
ensure
that
future
violations
do
not
occur
.
epa
notes
that
its
conclusion
regarding
the
relevance
of
maintenance
may
well
be
different
for
other
clean
air
act
provisions
where
the
test
is
whether
emissions
reduction
measures
are
`
necessary
'
for
attainment
,
even
if
maintenance
is
not
explicitly
mentioned
.
see
section
211c4c
)
(
allowing
states
to
overcome
federal
preemption
of
state
fuel
controls
where
`
necessary
'
to
achieve
a

)
and
section
184c

(
providing
for
epa
approval
of
ozone
transport
commission
recommendations
of
additional
control
measures
`
necessary
'
to
bring
any
area
in
the
region
into
attainment
.
it
may
make
less
sense
to
disregard
maintenance
to
disallow
more
stringent
fuel
controls
under
section
211
or
to
disapprove
additional
controls
under
section
184
where
these
measures
not
only
contribute
to
but
are
`
necessary
'
for
maintenance
.
the
rationale
that
the
state
might
appropriately
retain
discretion
to
choose
other
options
to
ensure
maintenance
makes
less
sense
when
the
specific
measures
in
question
are
`
necessary
'
<
footnote

the
transportation
conformity
rule
applies
to
all
nonattainment
and
maintenance
areas
,
and
does
not
distinguish
between
nonclassifiable
nonattainment
and
other
nonattainment
areas
.
consequently
,
epa
interprets
the
transportation
conformity
rules
reference
to
the
need
for
nonattainment
areas
to
obtain
a
section
182f
)
exemption
in
order
to
be
relieved
of
the
no
conformity
requirements
to
include
nonclassifiable
ozone
nonattainment
areas
(
(
ie

,
,

areas
,
even
though
such

are
not
subject
to

182f
)
itself
.
this
means
that
ozone
nonattainment
areas
,
including
nonclassifiable
ozone
nonattainment
areas
,
can
only
be
exempted
from
the
no
provisions
of
the
transportation
conformity
rule
if
epa
determines
that
the
area
satisfies
the
substantive
test
required
for
an
areawide
section
182f
)
exemption
,
through
a
process
similar
to
that
required
for
section
182f
)
exemptions
which
are
not
related
to
conformity
.
thus
,
for
nonclassifiable
ozone
nonattainment
areas
outside
the
northeast
ozone
transport
region
,
epa
will
consider
requests
for
determinations
that
additional
no
reductions
would
not
contribute
to

if
such
areas
already
have
air
