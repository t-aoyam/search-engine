after
careful
review
of
the
comments
,
fsis
is
in
agreement
with
commenters
that
oppose
the
tentative
position
that
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
must
meet
a
minimum
protein
quality
requirement
,
ie
,
a
protein
digestibility
corrected
amino
acid
score
of
not
less
than
40
expressed
as
a
percent
or
the
alternative
measurement
of
essential
amino
acids
being
at
least
33
percent
of
the
total
17
amino
acids
present
.
the
lack
of
the
need
for
a
protein
quality
requirement
is
founded
on
scientific
literature
provided
and
cited
by
comments
from
academia
and
statements
made
by
other
commenters
regarding
the
status
of
the
quality
of
protein
in
diets
of
individuals
in
the
us
.
the
literature
stated
that
the
protein
quality
of
mechanically
deboned
poultry
is
comparable
to
handdeboned
hand
deboned
poultry
.
therefore
,
mechanically
deboned
poultry
can
be
used
in
poultry
and
meat
food
products
without
sacrificing
protein
quality
.
according
to
the
literature
,
during
the
20
to
30year
year
history
of
the
use
of
mdp
in
many
food
products
,
there
has
not
been
an
indication
of
problems
identified
with
protein
quality
.
furthermore
,
consumption
of
enough
highquality
high
quality
protein
by
humans
in
the
us
.
is
not
a
problem
.
in
the
preamble
of
the
final
nutrition
labeling
regulations
,
both
fsis
and
the
food
and
drug
administration
(
fda
)
stated
that
current
evidence
suggests
that
the
diet
typically
consumed
in
the
us
.
provides
for
an
adequate
protein
intake
of
sufficiently
high
quality
to
meet
the
nutritional
needs
of
adults
and
children
4
or
more
years
of
age
(
58
fr
632
and
2079
.
furthermore
,
since
there
are
no
outstanding
health
implications
requiring
the
establishment
of
protein
quality
criteria
for
food
products
,
in
general
,
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
require
such
criteria
for
a
specific
poultry
product
,
viz
,
mechanically
deboned
poultry
.

quality

.
twentyone
twenty
one
commenters
addressed
the
issue
of
quality
control
for
all
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
.
nineteen
of
the
21
commenters
did
not
believe
that
a
mandatory
quality
control
program
was
needed
for
the
production
of
such
products
.
the
commenters
stated
that
(
1
)
quality
control
programs
,
including
partial
quality
control
programs
(
pqc
,
should
remain
voluntary
programs
,
and
(
2
)
that
fsis
should
focus
compliance
program
efforts
on
issues
of
health
and
safety
of
products
and
allow
manufacturers
to
determine
quality
parameters
.
the
commenters
also
noted
that
they
operate
under
pqc
programs
for
manufacturing
mechanically
deboned
poultry
that
are
approved
by
fsis
,
and
any
additional
concerns
for
assuring
their
processes
are
in
conformance
with
current
regulations
should
be
incorporated
into
their
present
pqc
programs
rather
than
by
issuance
of
a
formal
requirement
through
rulemaking
.
fsis
believes
that
establishments
manufacturing
poultry
products
that
are
mechanically
separated
must
have
controls
in
place
to
assure
that
such
products
comply
with
the
agencys
proposed
definition
,
standard
,
and
other
criteria
.
however
,
after
reviewing
the
comments
and
reexamining
examining
the
agencys
current
regulatory
agenda
,
fsis
believes
that
because
there
are
efforts
underway
within
the
agency
to
study
and
address
ways
of
reducing
the
potential
for
situations
that
would
render
any
poultry
or
meat
food
product
adulterated
,
unwholesome
,
and
or
misbranded
it
is
premature
to
address
the
need
for
a
mandatory
quality
control
program
for
this
one
distinct
category
of
poultry
product
.
fsis
does
,
however
,
believe
that
records
of
achieving
compliance
with
parameters
established
for
mechanically
separated
poultry
product
,
eg
,
bone
solids
content
and
bone
particle
size
criteria
,
should
be
maintained
to
substantiate
that
boneless
poultry
criteria
meets
the
proposed
regulatory
manufacturing
practices
.

protein

.
nineteen
commenters
responded
to
the
tentative
position
on
establishing
a
minimum
protein
content
and
a
maximum
fat
content
requirement
for
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
with
greater
than
06
percent
bone
solids
content
.
all
nineteen
commenters
disagreed
with
fsis
'
position
on
establishing
such
a
protein
and
fat
content
requirement
for
this
mechanically
separated
poultry
.
the
commenters
stated
that
poultry
product
produced
by
mechanical
separation
is
used
as
an
ingredient
in
readytoconsume
ready
to
consume
products
of
which
most
have
established
protein
and
or
fat
standards
.
furthermore
,
the
commenters
stated
that
most
poultry
and
meat
food
products
are
now
required
to
have
nutrition
labeling
.
fsis
does
not
agree
that
`
most
readytoconsume
ready
to
consume
'
poultry
and
meat
food
products
have
established
protein
and
fat
standards
,
as
asserted
by
the
commenters
.
standards
of
identity
and
composition
for
poultry
and
meat
food
products
generally
do
not
include
minimum
protein
content
requirements
.
of
the
products
for
which
standards
stipulate
a
maximum
fat
content
,
most
are
sausages
composed
of
meat
from
livestock
.
there
are
no
fat
limitations
associated
with
sausages
made
from
poultry
,
according
to
fsis
policies
.
