environmental
leadership
program
:
update
epa
announces
the
next
steps
in
the
development
of
the
environmental
leadership
program
(
elp
.
after
reviewing
many
possible
options
,
the
agency
has
decided
to
proceed
with
pilot
projects
to
test
the
feasibility
of
a
voluntary
program
to
recognize
industrial
facilities
.
the
pilots
will
explore
ways
to
encourage
facilities
to
develop
innovative
audit
and
compliance
programs
and
to
reduce
the
risk
of
noncompliance
compliance
through
pollution
prevention
practices
.
the
wide
variety
of
public
comments
on
the
original
elp
proposal
(
published
in
the
federal
register
on
01/15/1993
)
clearly
indicated
an
interest
in
a
program
to
recognize
and
encourage
`
environmental
excellence
'
while
no
true
consensus
emerged
on
the
best
structure
or
goals
for
the
program
,
several
themes
were
common
to
the
majority
of
the
comments
:
&
bullepa
should
encourage
companies
and
facilities
of
all
sizes
and
from
all
industries
to
participate
in
the
program
.
&
bullepa
should
focus
its
program
on
individual
facilities
rather
than
on
entire
corporations
.
&
bullany
epadeveloped
epa
developed
statement
of
environmental
principles
would
duplicate
existing
privatesector
private
sector
efforts
and
would
be
difficult
to
enforce
.
in
response
to
these
comments
,
epa
has
decided
to
continue
developing
a
voluntary
,
facilitybased
facility
based
program
.
the
agency
will
develop
pilot
projects
with
specific
industries
and
states
to
evaluate
the
many
unresolved
issues
raised
during
the
comment
period
.
these
include
a
possible
multipletier
multiple
tier
structure
to
encourage
broad
participation
,
determining
the
role
of
compliance
,
selfreporting
self
reporting
of
violations
,
public
accountability
,
the
role
of
incentives
in
encouraging
companies
to
exceed
minimum
requirements
,
and
how
pollution
prevention
practices
can
help
facilities
reduce
or
avoid
the
risk
of
noncompliance
compliance
.

and
steve

,
the
assistant
administrator
for
the
office
of
enforcement
and
compliance
assurance
(

been
asked
to
coordinate
this
effort
.
the
agency
will
provide
more
information
on
the
process
for
selecting
pilot
participants
and
on
the
development
of
test
projects
in
the
early
spring
of
1994
.
the
office
of
compliance
within
oeca
will
be
responsible

this
process

.
also
in
response
to
the
comments
,
the
agency
has
concluded
that
it
will
not
issue
its
own
guidelines
for
corporate
environmental
principles
,
but
rather
work
cooperatively
with
the
many
other
organizations
that
have
developed
corporate
and
industrywide
industry
wide
codes
of
environmental
conduct
.
the
office
of
pollution
prevention
and
toxics
will
take
responsibility
for
representing
the
agency
in
this
area
,
and
for
ensuring
the
involvement
of
other
epa
offices
where
appropriate
.
