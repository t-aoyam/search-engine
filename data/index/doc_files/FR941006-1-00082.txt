the
commission
is
continuing
to
consider
the
petition
as
part
of
this
rulemaking
and
seeks
further
comment
on
abolishing
the
gelac
.
the
commission
is
also
seeking
evidence
either
supporting
or
refuting
the
petitioners
claim
that
the
privatelyfunded
privately
funded
gelac
undermines
the
public
financing
of
general
election
campaigns
by
allowing
the
actuality
and
the
appearance
of
improper
influence
in
presidential
elections
.
absent
evidence
supporting
the
petitioners
claim
,
the
commission
would
be
reluctant
to
completely
eliminate
the
gelac
because
presidential
campaigns
would
need
to
devote
some
of
their
public
funds
for
compliance
expenses
,
instead
of
using
public
moneys
for
campaign
expenses
.
the
result
could
be
significant
difficulty
in
complying
with
the
public
financing
statutes
and
the
feca
.
the
gelac
is
also
used
to
make
repayments
,
which
would
need
to
be
funded
from
other
sources
.
moreover
,
the
elimination
of
monetary
contributions
of
$
1000
or
less
for
compliance
purposes
could
force
some
committees
to
turn
to
much
larger
inkind
in
kind
donation
of
legal
and
accounting
services
to
ensure
that
their
compliance
obligations
are
satisfied

and
(

.
accordingly
,
comments
are
requested
on
several
alternative
revisions
to
the
gelac
.
for
example
,
should
the
amount
raised
and
spent
for
compliance
costs
be
limited
to
a
fixed
percentage
of
the
general
election
spending
limit
?
if
so
,
what
amount
or
percentage
would
be
sufficient
to
ensure
that
adequate
amounts
are
available
for
meeting
compliance
obligations
?
please
note
that
this
approach
is
not
included
in
the
proposed
rules
which
follow
.
the
petitioners
and
one
commenter
also
challenge
the
appropriateness
of
allowing
fundraising
costs
for
the
gelac
to
be
paid
for
by
the
gelac
on
the
ground
these
expenses
are
campaign
expenses
that
should
be
subject
to
the
spending
limits
.
the
current
rules
permit
fundraising
costs
to
be
paid
by
the
gelac
because
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
sue
public
funds
to
solicit
private
contributions
that
are
used
solely
for
legal
and
accounting
compliance
purposes
.
however
,
the
commission
is
concerned
that
fundraising
activities
for
the
gelac
could
be
used
to
generate
electoral
support
for
the
candidates
campaign
,
and
if
so
,
should
be
treated
as
qualified
campaign
expenses
.
accordingly
,
comments
are
sought
on
whether
to
continue
to
permit
the
gelac
to
pay
the
entire
amount
of
these
costs
,
or
whether
a
fixed
percentage
of
gelac
fundraising
costs
should
be
paid
by
the
general
election
campaign
committee
.
splitting
the
costs
would
recognize
that
solicitations
and
other
activities
conducted
to
raised
gelac
funds
have
a
campaignrelated
campaign
related
component
.
comments
are
sought
as
to
the
appropriate
percentage
that
should
be
paid
from
general
election
funds
.
please
note
that
this
approach
is
not
included
in
the
proposed
rules
which
follow
.
the
commission
is
also
considering
modifying
section
90033a1ia
,
which
currently
requires
solicitations
to
clearly
state
that
the
contributions
are
solicited
for
the
gelac
.
a
new
sentence
would
also
require
solicitations
to
state
that
contributions
to
the
gelac
may
not
be
used
for
campaign
purposes
.
please
note
that
the
provisions
regarding
predesignations
and
transfer
of
primary
funds
to
the
gelac
in
paragraphs
(
a1
)
(
iiiv
)
would
be
reorganized
.
current
paragraphs
(
a2i
)
(
a
)
through
(
h
)
of
section
90033
set
forth
the
permissible
sues
of
gelac
funds
.
the
petition
for
rulemaking
urged
the
commission
to
delete
current
paragraph
(
h
)
allowing
gelac
funds
to
be
used
to
pay
unreimbursed
costs
of
providing
transportation
for
the
secret
service
and
national
security
staff
.
although
this
provisions
is
included
in
the
attached
proposed
rules
,
the
commission
seeks
further
comment
on
whether
it
is
appropriate
to
use
gelac
funds
for
this
purpose
.
please
note
that
gelac
funds
may
not
be
used
to
pay
transition
costs

and
winding
down
expenses
that
are
not

.
in
addition
,
the
commission
proposes
reducing
from
70
%
to
50
%
the
standard
amount
that
the
gelac
may
pay
for
computerrelated
computer
related
costs
,
and
the
corresponding
exclusion
from
the
spending
limits
.
see

cfr

)
and
(

.
the
gelac
is
relatively
small
in
comparison
to
the
publicly
funded
general
election
account
.
much
of
the
computer
costs
are
for
basic
accounting
purposes
,
which
the
campaign
committee
would
need
to
perform
regardless
of
the
need
to
comply
with
the
campaign
financing
laws
.
please
note
,
however
,
that
committees
would
still
be
able
to
deduct
a
higher
amount
if
they
can
show
that
their
computerrelated
computer
related
compliance
costs
are
higher
.
section
90033a2iv
)
would
be
modified
slightly
to
clarify
that
funds
remaining
in
the
gelac
may
only
be
used
to
pay
debts
remaining
from
the
primary
or
for
other
lawful
purposes
if
all
gelac
expenses
have
been
paid
.
finally
the
commission
is
proposing
to
revise
two
citations
contained
in
11
cfr
90033a2iii
.
the
first
sentence
of
this
paragraph
currently
refers
to
paragraphs

be
updated

(

through

)
and
(
h
'
also
,
the
citation
to
paragraph

)
in
the
second
sentence
should
instead
refer
paragraph

.
b
.
gains
on
the
use
of
public
funds
section
90045
of
the
commissions
regulations
allows
a
committee
to
invest
public
funds
or
use
them
in
other
ways
to
generate
income
,
provided
that
an
amount
equal
to
the
net
income
derived
from
those
investments
,
minus
any
taxes
paid
,
is
repaid
to
the
treasury
.
section
90072b4
)
also
lists
the
receipt
of
any
income
as
a
result
of
investment
or
other
use
of
payments
from
the
fund
pursuant
to
11
cfr
90045
as
one
of
the
basis
for
requiring
repayment
.
these
provisions
seek
to
ensure
that
any
income
received
through
these
use
of
public
funds
benefits
the
public
financing
system
.
the
proposed
rules
would
indicate
that
section
90045
applies
to
any
use
of
public
funds
that
results
in
come
to
the
committee
,
regardless
of
whether
the
committee
engaged
in
that
use
with
the
intention
of
generating
income
.
the
proposed
rules
also
contain
a
conforming
amendment
to
section
90072b4
,
which
would
indicate
that
income
on
investment
or
other
use
of
payments
from
the
fund
must
be
repaid
to
the
treasury
.
the
comission
notes
that
if
a
committee
loses
an
item
that
is
insured
,
and
the
insurance
proceeds
exceeds
the
cost
of
replacing
the
item
,
such
excess
would
be
considered
income
for
the
purposes
of
proposed
sections
90045
and
90072b4
.
