that
when
conscientiously
used
by
welltrained
well
trained
,
wellsupervised
well
supervised
personnel
,
glove
bags
can
effectively
reduce
asbestos

release
.
the
niosh
study
demonstrated
clearly
that
the
obverse
is
also
true
;
when
glove
bags
are
used
improperly
by
untrained
or
insufficiently
trained
workers
,
airborne
fiber
levels
can
become
significantly
elevated
.
consequently
,
based
on
this
extensive
evidence
and
analysis
,
osha
is
permitting
wider
use
of
glove
bag
technology
in
the
final
standard
,
but
is
including
additional
requirements
to
improve
the
effectiveness
of
their
use
.
the
agency
notes
that
the
new
regulatory
text
prescribing
the
specifications
and
work
practices
for
allowable
glove
bag
removals
would
prohibit
the
kind
of
removal
activity
observed
in
the
niosh
study
.
based
on
its
study
,
niosh
recommended
detailed
work
practices
and
specifications
for
glove
bag
use
.
osha
has
incorporated
the
major
recommendations
into
the
standard
,
either
as
part
of
the
overall
requirements
for
asbestos
removal
,
or
as
required
components
of
permitted
glove
bag
systems
.
for
example
,
niosh
recommends
that
workers
`
spray
frequently
during
the
removal
process
so
that
newly
exposed
surfaces
are
wetted
'
osha
requires
that
all
work
be
performed
using
wet
methods
.
`
wet
methods
'
are
defined
as
,
applying
sufficient
water
to
acm
and
pacm
during
the
work
operation
so
that
fibers
,
if
released
,
are
prevented
from
becoming
airborne
.
other
recommendations
likewise
are
covered
by
more
generic
requirements
.
for
class
i
work
in
which
glove
bags
are
used
,
osha
is
requiring
that
2
persons
perform
the

other
systems
although
glove
bag
systems
were
the
alternative
system
most
discussed
during
the
rulemaking
,
participants
submitted
data
on
other
systems
which
were
claimed
to
effectively
isolate
asbestos
dust
during
removal
.
the
agency
has
reviewed
the
data
and
comment
on
these
submissions
and
has
listed
four
additional
systems
as
permitted
for
class
i
work
under
stated
circumstances
in

the
agency
emphasizes
that
the
listing
of
any
system
is
not
an
endorsement
by
osha
.
the
listing
merely
indicates
that
various
combinations
of
engineering
controls
and
work
practices
represented
by
these
systems

when
properly
carried
out

and
when
all

required

are
found
by

to
constitute
