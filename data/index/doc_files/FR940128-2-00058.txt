in
05/19/1993
,
the
navy
initiated
a
scoping
process
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
scope
of
significant
issues
to
be
addressed
related
to
this
action
.
a
scoping
meeting
was
held
in
the
city
of
long
beach
on
27
05/19/1993
and
the
process
of
preparing
the
eis
was
begun
.
more
recently
,
however
,
the
navy
has
become
aware
that
additional
potential
reuses
of
the
hospital
site
may
have
been
identified
that
need
to
be
evaluated
through
the
nepa
process
.
therefore
,
the
scoping
process
is
being
reopened
for
a
period
of
90
days
from
the
date
of
this
notice
to
allow
communities
,
organizations
,
and
the
public
to
submit
to
the
navy
additional
reuse
alternatives
or
substantive
environmental
issues
of
concern
.
the
navy
will
then
fully
evaluate
potential
reuse
recommendations
that
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
implementation
and
which
would
generate
jobs
and
or
revenues
for
the
local
economy
.
public
scoping
meetings
will
be
conducted
in
late
03/19/1994
to
allow
oral
public
scoping
comments
.
a
notice
of
time
and
place
for
these
meetings
will
be
advertised
in
local
newspapers
and
mailed
to
local
city
officials
.
it
is
important
that
federal
,
state
,
and
local
agencies
and
interested
individuals
take
this
opportunity
to
identify
environmental
concerns
that
should
be
addressed
during
the
preparation
of
the
eis
.
agencies
and
the
public
are
invited
and
encouraged
to
provide
written
comment
in
addition
to
,
or
in
lieu
of
,
oral
comments
at
the
public
meetings
.
to
be
most
helpful
,
scoping
comments
should
clearly
describe
specific
issues
or
topics
which
the
commentor
believes
the
eis
should
address
.
written
comments
