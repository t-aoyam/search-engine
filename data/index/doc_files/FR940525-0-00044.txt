may
be

insurers
then
are
responsible
for
all
aspects

including

and
to
policyholders
insured
by

and
the

the
insurers
retain
a
specified
amount
of
the
premium
for
their
expenses
,
including
the
commissions
of
agents
.
under
the
arrangement
,
the
government
provides
such
additional
funds
as
may
be
required
,
over
and
above
the
net
premium
income
,
for
the
payment
of
claims
.
once
the
arrangement
is
signed
by
the
authorized
official
of
the
private
insurer
and
the
government
,
it
is
effective
at
the
beginning
of
the
governments
fiscal
year
on
october
1
and
runs
through
the
following
september
30
.
also
,
in
accordance
with
article
vcommencement
and
termination
of
the
arrangement
,
the
federal
insurance
administration
(
fia
)
is
required
,
by
june

of
each
year
,
to
publish
in
the
federal
register
the
terms
for

this
interim
rule
amends
the
national
flood
insurance
program
(
nfip
)
regulations
dealing
with
the
marketing
of
flood
insurance
policies
,
at
article
iiundertakings
of
the
company
,
paragraph
g
.
of
the
arrangement
,
by
requiring
the
wyo
company
to
follow
marketing
guidelines
established
by
the
federal
insurance
administration
(
fia
.
fia
is
currently
developing
marketing
guidelines
which
will
then
be
established
in
consultation
with
representatives
of
the
wyo
companies
.
as
a
result
of
the
heavy
flood
losses
which
occurred
in
recent
years
(
ie
,
hurricanes
andrew
and
iniki
in
august
and
09/19/1992
,
the
northeaster
storm
in
12/19/1992
,
the
blizzard
of
03/19/1993
,
and
the
midwest
flooding
in
the
summer
of
1993
,
fema
recently
had
to
exercise
its
borrowing
authority
for
the
first
time
in
eight
years
.
while
the
program
has
been
growing
modestly
,
greater
increases
in
the
policyholder
base
are
needed
to
provide
additional
premium
dollars
to
build
up
the
reserves
to
meet
future
catastrophic
flooding
events
.
further
,
large
numbers
of
the
victims
of
recent
flood
disasters
were
not
protected
by
flood
insurance
.
therefore
,
fema
has
determined
that
sufficient
cause
exists
for
making
this
rule
effective
immediately
so
the
revised
arrangement
can
be
the
basis
of
the
offer
required
by
june
1
and
that
delaying
the
effective
date
until
after
a
comment
period
would
be
impracticable
and
contrary
to
the
public
interest
.
however
,
comments
are
requested
and
will
be
considered
before
further
regulations
are
issued
