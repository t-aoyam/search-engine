at
a
minimum
,
the
work
practice
implementation
plan
should
specifically
identify
procedures
(
eg
,
checklists
)
for
confirming
:
1
.
that
all
storage
containers
are
normally
closed
,
that
is
,
closed
unless
an
operator
is
actively
engaged
in
activities
such
as
emptying
or
filling
the
container
;
2
.
that
organic
solvents
are
not
used
for
spray
booth
cleaning
,
except
as
allowed
by
the
proposed
rule
;
3
.
that
conventional
air
spray
guns
are
not
in
use
at
any
finishing
application
station
,
except
as
allowed
by
the
proposed
rule
;
4
.
that
cleaning
solvent
from
gun
cleaning
and
line
flushing
is
collected
in
a
normally
closed
container
;
5
.
that
the
washoff
tank
is
normally
closed
;
and
6
.
that
dripping
from
the
washoff
tank
is
minimized
by
tilting
and
rotating
the
part
to
drain
as
much
solvent
as
possible
.
other
programs
to
be
incorporated
into
the
work
practice
implementation
plan
include
:
1
.
an
inspection
and
maintenance
(
iampm
)
plan
to
address
equipment
leaks
from
transfer
operations
;
2
.
an
operator
training
program
;
3
.
an
accounting
system
for
washoff
and
cleaning
solvents
;
and
4
.
a
formulation
assessment
plan
.
the
iampm
plan
for
equipment
leaks
must
require
,
at
a
minimum
,
inspection
of
all
equipment
(
eg
,
pumps
,
valves
,
and
flanges
)
used
to
transfer
or
apply
finishing
materials
,
adhesives
,
and
solvents
.
the
inspection
may
be
a
visual
inspection
only
,
but
must
be
conducted
at
a
minimum
frequency
of
once
per
month
,
with
repairs
to
leaking
equipment
made
within
15
calendar
days
.
the
operator
training
program
must
require
that
all
new
and
existing
personnel
involved
in
finishing
,
gluing
,
cleaning
,
and
washoff
operations
be
trained
.
all
new
personnel
,
those
hired
after
the
effective
date
of
the
standard
,
shall
be
trained
upon
hiring
.
all
existing
personnel
,
those
hired
before
the
effective
date
of
the
standard
,
shall
be
trained
within
6
months
of
the
effective
date
of
the
standard
.
all
personnel
shall
be
given
refresher
training
annually
.
the
training
must
include
,
at
a
minimum
,
appropriate
application
techniques
,
appropriate
cleaning
and
washoff
procedures
,
appropriate
equipment
setup
,
and
appropriate
management
of
cleaning
wastes
.
the
solvent
accounting
system
must
require
,
at
a
minimum
,
that
the
facility
record
the
quantity
and
type
of
solvent
used
for
washoff
and
cleaning
,
the
number
of
pieces
washed
off
and
the
reasons
why
,
and
the
quantity
of
spent
solvent
generated
from
each
site
.
the
work
practice
standards
also
must
require
the
owner
or
operator
of
the
affected
source
to
develop
a
formulation
assessment
plan
(
fap
.
the
plan
requires
the
facility
to
track
usage
of
those
volatile
hap
that
are
listed
in
the
proposed
rulemaking
pursuant
to
section
112g
)
as
`
nonthreshold
'
`
high
concern
'
or
`
unrankable
'
(
collectively
these
are
called
`
vhap
of
potential
concern
.
under
the
fap
,
each
facility
would
identify
a
baseline
level
of
usage
for
each
vhap
of
potential
concern
presented
in
table
4
of
the
proposed
rule
.
the
baseline
usage
level
would
be
the
highest
annual
usage
from
1994
,
1995
,
or
1996
.
if
,
after
11/19/1998
,
the
annual
usage
of
the
vhap
exceeds
its
baseline
level
,
the
owner
or
operator
of
the
affected
source
must
provide
a
written
notification
to
the
permitting
authority
that
describes
the
amount
of
increase
and
explains
the
reasons
for
exceedance
of
the
baseline
level
.
the
following
explanation
would
relieve
the
owner
or
operator
from
further
action
,
unless
the
affected
source
is
not
in
compliance
with
any
state
regulations
or
requirements
for
that
vhap
.
1
.
the
increase
is
de
minimis
(
no
more
than
15
percent
above
the
established
baseline
;
2
.
the
facility
complies
with
any
state
air
toxics
regulations
or
guidelines
for
that
vhap
;
3
.
it
results
from
the
adoption
of
low
voc
coatings
,
that
is
,
coatings
with
a
voc
content
of
no
more
than
1
lb
voc
lb
solids
,
as
applied
(
the
potential
increase
in
hap
being
deemed
acceptable
because
it
is
offset
by
a
decrease
in
voc
;
or
4
.
the
usage
is
below
the
de
minimis
values
presented
in
table
4
of
§
63
803
of
the
proposed
rule
.
