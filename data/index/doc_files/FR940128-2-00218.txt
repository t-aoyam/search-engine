settlement
of
disciplinary
actions
.
the
exchanges
enforcement
department
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
issuing
disciplinary
charges
if
,
following
an
investigation
,
it
is
determined
that
persons
or
entities
within
the
exchanges
jurisdiction
committed
serious
infractions
of
the
exchanges
rules
or
the
federal
securities
laws
.
the
issuance
of
formal
charges
begins
a
rather
lengthy
process
involving
the
filing
of
an
answer
to
the
charges
,
the
exchange
of
documents
,
and
the
scheduling
of
a
disciplinary
hearing
.
very
often
,
however
,
persons
who
are
the
subject
of
exchange
investigations
wish
to
settle
the
matter
before
formal
charges
are
issued
by
stipulating
to
certain
facts
and
consenting
to
a
penalty
.
at
present
,
article
v
,
section
1b4
)
of
the
constitution
and
rule
345c
)
require
the
issuance
of
formal
charges
before
a
disciplinary
matter
can
be
settled
.
in
contrast
,
the
comparable
rules
at
the
nyse
,
nasd
,
and
cboe
permit
potential
respondents
to
settle
disciplinary
proceedings
without
the
service
of
formal
charges
.
it
is
proposed
that
the
exchange
conform
its
procedures
for
settling
disciplinary
actions
to
those
now
in
effect
at
all
the
other
major
selfregulatory
self
regulatory
organizations
.
there
would
be
several
advantages
to
amending
the
procedures
in
the
manner
proposed
.
first
,
it
would
save
the
substantial
time
and
expense
that
is
now
devoted
to
the
formal
charging
process
in
settled
cases
.
second
,
it
would
give
the
exchange
more
flexibility
in
negotiating
the
resolution
of
enforcement
actions
.
third
,
conforming
the
exchanges
settlement
procedures
to
those
in
place
at
the
other
principal
selfregulatory
self
regulatory
organizations
would
serve
the
interests
of
regulatory
uniformity
and
simplicity
.
finally
,
potential
respondents
would
still
retain
the
option
of
following
the
current
disciplinary
procedures
if
they
are
so
inclined
.
