summary

is
proposing
to
amend
regulations
to
clarify
use
of
the
designation
`

beaujolais
'

a
wine
label
.
in
response
to
comments
from
consumers
and
wine
industry
members
,
atf
is
proposing
that
a
wine
which
has
been
designated
with
a
varietal
type
designation
in
accordance
with
27
cfr
4
23a
,
and
which
derives
not
less
than
75
percent
of
its
volume
from
pinot
noir
grapes
or
napa
gamay
grapes
,
may
be
further
designated
with
the
optional
term
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
when
the
optional
designation
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
appears
on
the
brand
label
,
it
shall
be
in
direct
conjunction
with
the
required
varietal
type
designation
(
pinot
noir
or
napa
gamay
)
and
appellation
of
origin
,
in
lettering
of
substantially
the
same
size

kind
.
atf
believes
that
this
clarification
of
the
label

'
will
be
informative
to

and
industry
in
the
marketing
and

disclosing

appear

history
of
gamay
beaujolais
name
for
many
years
atf
has
permitted
the
use
of
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
on
wine
labels
as
a
varietal
designation
.
this
resulted
from
the
identification
in
the
1940s
,
of
a
grape
grown
in
napa
county
,
california
as
the
gamay
grape
native
to
the
beaujolais
region
of
france
.
in
the
late
1960s
,
the
university
of
california
at
davis
(
ucd
)
determined
that
the
grape
known
as
napa
gamay
was
the
true
french
gamay
and
that
the
gamay
beaujolais
vine
was
actually
a
clone
of
pinot
noir
.
since
then
,
atf
has
permitted
wine
produced
from
both
the
napa
gamay
and
pinot
noir
grape
varieties
to
be
labeled
as
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
the

(

)
at

(
a
service
operated
in
cooperation
with
ucd
which
makes
virus
free
,
true
type
plant
material
available
to
the
industry
)
also
identified
the
gamay
beaujolais
vine
as
a
clonal
selection
of
the
pinot
noir
variety
.
more
recently
,
ucd
determined
that
the
grape
known
as
napa
gamay
is
not
the
gamay
grape
of
france
.
napa
gamay
has
been
positively
identified
by
the
fpms
as
valdiguie
,
although
it
is
not
widely
known
by
this
name
.
winegrape

advisory
committee
in
1982
,
atf
established
the
winegrape

names
advisory
committee
(
referred
to
as
the
`
committee
)
to
conduct
an
examination
of
the
hundreds
of
grape
variety
names
and
synonyms
in
use
[

fr
13623
,
03/31/1982
.
according
to
its
charter
,
the
committee
was
to
advise
the
director
of
the
grape
varieties
and
subvarieties
which
are
used
in
the
production
of
wine
,
to
recommend
appropriate
label
designations
for
these
varieties
,
and
to
recommend
guidelines
for
approval
of
names
suggested
for
new
grape
varieties
.
their
recommendations
were
restricted
to
grape
names
used
in
producing
american
wines
.
the
committees
final
report
,
presented
to
the
director
in
09/19/1984
,
contained
the
committees
findings
regarding
use
of
the
most
appropriate
names
for
domestic
winegrape
varieties
.
one
finding
which
appeared
in
the
l984
final
report
of
the
winegrape
varietal
names
advisory
committee
was
that
the
name
`
gamay
beaujolais
'
is
not
the
name
of
any
grape
variety
.
however
,
the
report
did
recommend
that
the
term
be
permitted
for
use
during
a
five
year
phase
out
period
,
for
wine
made
either
from
the
grape
called
napa
gamay
,
or
from
the
gamay
beaujolais
clone
of
pinot
noir
.
