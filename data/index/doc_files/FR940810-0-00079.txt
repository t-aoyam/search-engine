most
of
the
requirements
in

(

are
instructions
to
use
specified
work
practices
.
the
work
practice
approach
to
controlling
asbestos
exposure
in
construction
activities
is
widely
endorsed
.
it
is
the
model
for

under

(

,
most
state

and

osha
has
tried
to
formulate
work
practice
requirements
as
simple
,
flexible
instructions
,
embodying
the
basic
control
strategies
for
asbestos
dust
suppression
.
these
are
to
wet
it
down
,
contain
the
disturbance
,
and

engineering
controls
which
are
listed
and
described
in
the
regulation
are
the
ones
which
the
rulemaking
record
confirms
are
used
,
understood
,
and
effective
.
osha
expects
that
modifications
and
innovations
in
asbestos
control
technology
will
be
developed
.
the
standards
provide
for
this
by
setting
up
general
criteria
for
alternative
controls
,
and
an
easily
met
procedure
to
allow
the
use
of
effective
alternatives
.
paragraph
(
g6
)
governs
alternatives
for
class
i
control
methods
,
and
paragraph
(
g7vi
)
for
class
ii
methods
.
for
both
classes
,
detailed
written
demonstrations
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
alternative
modification
are
required
and
evaluations
by
designated
persons
are
required
.
alternatives
for
class
i
work
require
a
more
rigorous
demonstration
of
effectiveness
,
and
advance
notice
to
osha
of
their
use
.
osha
intends
these
requirements
to
be
capable
of
being
met
by
welldesigned
well
designed
and
tested
alternative
control
methods
.
they
are
meant
to
exclude
shortcut
short
cut
methods
which
hope
to
evade
the
other
provisions
in
the
standard
.
by
their
inclusion
,
osha
is
stating
its
policy
view
that
industry
has
demonstrated
its
responsible
innovative
capability
in
the
past
,
and
will
continue
to
do
so
.
the
first
provision
in
the
construction
methods
of
compliance
paragraph
,
(
g1i
,
requires
that
three
basic
and
simple
controls
be
utilized
in
all
operations
covered
by
the
construction
standard
,
regardless
of
exposure
levels
in
those
operations
.
these
provisions
apply
to
,
for
example
,
employers
who

and

the
controls
required
are
:
use
of
hepa
filtered
vacuums
to
collect
debris
and
visible
dust
;
use
of
wet
methods
to
control
asbestos
fiber
dispersion
;
and
prompt
disposal
of
asbestos
contaminated
waste
materials
.
osha
has
imposed
these
controls
to
reduce
airborne
contamination
by
asbestos
fibers
disturbed
during
construction
activities
.
however
fibers
are
released
,
contamination
can
be
reduced
by
suppressing
asbestos
containing
dusts
,
and
or
collecting
them
before
they
dry
and
are
able
to
migrate
.
osha
believes
that
most
employers
will
be
able
to
use
wet
methods
,
in
handling
asbestoscontaining
asbestos

materials
to
reduce

the
use
of
wet
methods
to
control
airborne
asbestos
was
not
explicitly
required
in
the
1986
construction
standard
.
it
was
mentioned
among
the
control
measures
which
could
be
used
to
keep
down
fiber
levels
during
`
maintenance
and
renovation
projects
in

do

themselves

in
the
method
of
compliance
section
,
osha
presented
use
of
wet
methods
among
a
list
of
engineering
and
work
practice
controls
from
which
an
employer
could
choose
when
seeking
to
comply
with
the
pel
.
the
1972
asbestos
standard
had
required
the
use
of
wet
methods
to
the
extent
practicable
to
reduce
the
release
of
asbestos
fibers
unless
the
usefulness
of
the
product
would
be
diminished
by
the
use
of
such
methods
.
on
reconsideration
,
osha
now
finds
the
use
of
wet
methods
to
be
an
inexpensive
,
generally
feasible
,
and
highly
effective
way
to
control
release
of
asbestos
fibers
and
returns
to
the
earlier
requirement
for
its
use
in
all
feasible
situations
