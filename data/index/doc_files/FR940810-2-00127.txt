applicants
submit
that
the
requested
exemption
to
permit
the

to
implement
the
proposed
cdsc

appropriate

is
consistent
with
the
protection
of
investors
and
the
purposes
fairly
intended
by
the
policy
and
provisions
of
the
act

the
proposed
cdsc
arrangements
will
provide
shareholders
the
option

having
greater
investment
dollars
