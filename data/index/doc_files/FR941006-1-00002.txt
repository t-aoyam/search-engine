summary
:
we
are
proposing
to
amend
the
regulations
concerning
interstate
movement
of
horses
that
test
positive
for
equine
infectious
anemia
to
allow
the
horses
to
be
moved
interstate
directly
to
slaughter
under
a
permit
and
in
a
sealed
conveyance
,
as
an
alternative
to
the
horses
being
officially
identified
prior
to
the
interstate
movement
with
a
hot
iron
or
chemical
brand
,
freezemarking
,
or
a
lip
tattoo
.
this
proposed
change
in
the
regulations
would
provide
owners
of
equine
infectious
anemia
reactors
with
an
alternative
means
of
handling
their
animals
while
preventing
the
spread
of
this
communicable

supplementary
information
:
background
the
regulations
in
9
cfr
part
75
(
referred
to
below
as
the
regulations
)
contain
provisions
for
the
interstate
movement
of
horses
,
asses
,
ponies
,
mules
,
and
zebras
that
test
positive
for
communicable
diseases
,
including
equine
infections
anemia
(
eia
.
the
purpose
of
these
provisions
is
to
prevent
the
spread
of
communicable
diseases
,
including
eia
.
a
viral
disease
of
equines
,
eia
,
also
known
as
swamp
fever
,
may
be
characterized
by
sudden
fever
,
swelling
of
the
legs
and
lower
parts
of
the
body
,
severe
weight
loss
,
and
anemia
.
section
754a
)
of
the
regulations
defines
an
eia
reactor
as
any
horse
,
ass
,
mule
,
pony
or
zebra
which
is
subjected
to
an
official
test
and
found
positive
.
under
§
754b
)
of
the
regulations
,
no
eia
reactor
may
be
moved
interstate
unless
the
reactor
is
officially
identified
and
meets
certain
other
requirements
.
section
754a
)
of
the
regulations
defines
`
officially
identified
'
as
the
permanent
identification
of
a
reactor
with
markings
permanently
applied
by
an
animal
and
plant
health
inspection
service
(
aphis
)
representative
,
a
state
representative
,
or
an
accredited
veterinarian
using
a
hot
iron
or
chemical
brand
,
freezemarking
or
a
lip
tattoo
.
aphis
believes
that
eia
reactors
could
be
moved
interstate
to
slaughter
under
a
permit
and
in
a
sealed
conveyance
,
as
an
alternative
to
being
officially
identified
prior
to
the
interstate
movement
.
moving
eia
reactors
interstate
to
slaughter
under
a
permit
and
in
a
sealed
conveyance
would
ensure
that
the
animals
are
not
diverted
for
other
uses
.
therefore
,
we
are
proposing
to
amend
the
requirements
for
interstate
movement
in
§
754b
)
by
adding
a
provision
stating
that
`
official
identification
is
not
necessary
if
the
animal
is
moved
directly
to
slaughter
,
traveling
under
a
permit
and
in
a
sealed
conveyance
'
in
addition
,
we
propose
to
add
definitions
to
§
754a
)
for
`
official
seal
'
and
`
permit
'
an
official
seal
would
be
defined
as
a
`
serially
numbered
metal
or
plastic
strip
,
or
a
serially
numbered
button
,
consisting
of
a
selflocking
self
locking
device
on
one
end
and
a
slot
on
the
other
end
,
which
forms
a
loop
when
the
ends
are
engaged
and
which
cannot
be
reused
if
opened
.
it
is
applied
by
an
aphis
representative
or
state
representative
'
a
permit
would
be
defined
as
an
`
official
document
(
vs
form
127
or
a
state
form
which
contains
the
same
information
,
but
not
a
`
permit
for
entry
)
issued
by
an
aphis
representative
,
state
representative
,
or
accredited
veterinarian
which
lists
the
owners
name
and
address
,
points
of
origin
and
destination
,
number
of

covered
