in
the
federal

of

(

the

(

,
propose
to
amend

establishing

exemption

there

received
in

to
the

.
the
data
submitted
on

proposal
and
other
relevant
material
have
been
evaluated
and
discussed
in
the
proposed
rule
.
based
on
the
data
and
information
considered
,
the
agency
concludes
that
the
tolerance
exemption
will
protect
the
public
health
.
therefore
,
the
tolerance
exemption
is
established
as
set
forth
below
.
any
person
adversely
affected
by
this
regulation
may
,
within
30
days
after
publication
of
this

request
a

a
copy

the
objections

requests
filed
with
the

should
be
submitted

and
the
grounds
for

(

each

if

a

will
be
granted
if
the
administrator
determines
that
the
material
submitted
shows
the
following
:
there
is
a
genuine
and
substantial
issue
of
fact
;
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
available
evidence
identified
by
the

would
,
if
established
,
resolve
one
or
more
of
such
issues
in
favor
of
the
requestor
,
taking
into
account
uncontested
claims
or
facts
to
the
contrary
;
and
resolution
of
the
factual
issues
)
in
the
manner
sought
by
the
requestor
would
be
adequate
to
justify
the
action
requested

under

order
12866
(

4
,
1993
,
the
agency
must
determine
whether
the
regulatory
action
is
`
significant
'
and
therefore
subject
to
review
by
the
office
of
management
and
budget
(

and
the
requirements
of
the
executive
order
.
under
section
3f
,
the
order
defines
a
`
significant
regulatory
action
'
as
an
action
that
is
likely
to
result
in
a
rule
(

)
having
an
annual
effect
on
the
economy
of

forth

pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the

has
determined
that
this

is
not

not
subject

review

the

has

establishing

from

requirements

not
have
a
significant
economic
