a
review
of
the
comments
and
evidence
demonstrates
that
there
is
a
high
degree
of
prevalence
of
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
flooring
and
that
there
are
diagnostic
difficulties
in
identifying
asbestos
fibers
in
flooring
material
.
consequently
,
osha
is
changing
its
approach
and
the
final
standard
provides
that
the
employers
shall
assume
in
removing
flooring
that
it
contains
asbestos
and
take
the
specific
precautions
unless
the
employer
demonstrates
that
the
flooring
materials
are
not
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
.
such
a
showing
must
be
based
on
analysis
which
is
likely
to
reveal
the
asbestos
content
of
the
flooring
material
,
the
backing
and
the
mastic
.
no
one
protocol
for
analysis
is
specified
,
but
the
standard
requires
that
a
certified
industrial
hygienist
(
cih
)
or
project
designer
certify
the
analytical
results
.
osha
believes
that
the
final
standards
provisions
relating
to
flooring
removal
are
more
comprehensive
and
protective
than
the
proposals
.
there
,
an
exemption
for
flooring
removals
from
the
npe
requirement
was
conditioned
merely
on
compliance
with
certain
work
practices
recommended
by
the
resilient
floor
covering
institute
(
rfci
.
these
practices
included
a
prohibition
of
sanding
of
floor
or
backing
,
use
of
a
hepa
vacuum
cleaner
before
and
after
removal
,
prohibition
of
dry
sweeping
,
application
of
new
material
over
old
tiles
without
removal
if
possible
,
wet
removal
of
residual
felt
,
and
bagging
and
disposal
of
waste
in
6
mil
plastic
containers
.
the
new
final
provisions
allow
removal
to
be
performed
by
these
methods
,
but
also
allow
various
heating
methods
to
be
used
,
or
any
other
means
of
loosening
floor
tiles
,
without
breakage
.
unlike
the
proposal
,
an
employer
cannot
proceed
without
negative
air
or
critical
barriers
,
merely
using
nonaggressive
aggressive
work
practices
and
wet
methods
,
unless
his
prejob
job
evaluation
shows
that
similar
floor
removals
(
in
the
same
building
or
of
the
same
materials
and
mastics
)
were
successfully
completed
by
work
crews
with
adequate
training
and
experience
in
working
under
these
conditions
.
osha
noted
in
the
proposal
that
data
provided
by
rfci
showed
that
where
jobs
followed
their
recommended
practices
,
mean
exposures
to
workers
were
between
0
0045
and
0
03
f
cc
for
workers
performing
floor
tile
removal
,
removal
of
resilient
sheet
flooring
,
or
removal
of
cutback
adhesive
.
during
the
rulemaking
,
additional
data
were
submitted
showing
exposure
levels
during
flooring
removals
.
david
kirby
,
osha
witness
from
oak
ridge
national
laboratory
(
ornl
)
said
that
he
has
used
the
rfci
work
practices
successfully

maintaining

at
an
average

when
asked
what
additional
precautions
were
taken
at
his
facilities
during
these
operations
,
he
replied
that
`
we
do
use
regulated
areas
in
the
sense
that
we
dont
allow
anyone
in
the
area
as
were
doing
the
work
,
and
we
also
require
workers
to
wear
respiratory
protection
as

doing
this
activity

we

there

in

argued
that
the
rfci
methods
specifically
,
and
`
nonaggressive
non

'
flooring
removal
methods
generally
,
do
not
always
result
in
exposure
levels
which
are
acceptable
(

it
cited
various
studies
or
project
results
submitted
to
the
record
.
some
of
these
results
were
given
in
terms
of
structures
per
square
centimeter
,
a
convention
of
tem
.
for
example
,
richard
kelly
of
lawrence
livermore
national
laboratory
objected
to
allowing
the
use
of
rfci
methods
to
control
asbestos
exposure
during
removal
of
asbestos
containing
mastic
(
ex
.

,

.
he
reported
that
during
removals
in
which
only
the
mastic
contained
asbestos
,
he
had
measured
(
by
tem
)
fiber
levels
of
33
s
cc
during
dry
power
chipping
of
vat
and
09
s
cc
during
wet
hand
removal
in
what
he
called
a
`
realworld
real
world
application
of
the
rfci
procedures
'
he
noted
that
the
floor
was
not
prevacuumed
vacuumed
nor
was
a
heat
gun
used
as
described
in
the
recommended
practices
.
under
its
ahera
rule
,
epa
defines
`
structure
'
as
a
microscopic
bundle
,
cluster
,
fiber
or
matrix
which
may
contain
asbestos
.
osha
notes
that
such
structures
may
be
smaller
and
or
thinner
than
the
asbestos
fibers
required
to
be
counted
under
the
osha
reference
method
.
a
general
summary
of
the
results
of
these
studies
shows
that
most
of
the
exposure
levels
were
below
the
proposed
pels
when
measured
using
the
osha
reference
method
