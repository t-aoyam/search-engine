formerly
,
the
general
industry
standard
had
been
considered
the
generic
asbestos
standard
.
however
,
because
of
dramatic
changes
in
the
market
for
asbestos
containing
products
,
the
standard
now
covers
only
four
industry
segments
,
three
of
which
are
distinct
from
each
other
,
and
all
are
diminishing
in
volume
and
employee
population
.
brake
and
clutch
repair
is
the
activity
engaged
in
by
the
largest
group
of
asbestos
exposed
workers
,
although
most
of
them
are
exposed
sporadically
and
at
low
levels
.
next
largest
is
custodial
workers
who
do
not
perform
their
duties
as
part
of
construction
activities
,
but
clean
surfaces
,
sweep
,
buff
and
vacuum
floors
and
wash
walls
and
windows
in
manufacturing
plants
and
a
wide
variety
of
public
and
commercial
buildings
.
although
in
the
preamble
to
the
proposal
and
throughout
this
proceeding
osha
and
most
commenters
had
treated
these
workers
as
part
of
the
construction
work
force
,
osha
concludes
that
pure
custodial
work
is
not
a
construction
activity
,
and
should
be
regulated
under
the
general
industry
standard
.
however
,
to
avoid
misinterpretation
or
for
purposes
of
clarity
of
duties
to
affected
parties
,
osha
also
is
including
provisions
protecting
custodial
workers
who
may
unknowingly
contact
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
material
in
the
construction
and
shipyard
employment
standards
.
in
this
way
,
there
will
be
no
advantage
to
interpreting
coverage
under
any
one
of
the
asbestos
standards
,
rather
than
another
.
the
primary
and
secondary
manufacture
of
asbestos
containing
products
,
completes
the
roster
of
identifiable
general
industry
sectors

osha
expands
on
this
theme
its
on
economic
analysis
later
in
this
document
.
at
the
time
of
the
proposal
,
epa
had
prohibited
,
at
three
stated
intervals
from
08/19/1990
to
08/19/1996
,
the
future
manufacture

importation

processing
and

in
commerce
of
asbestos
in
almost
all
products

.
subsequently
the
ban
was
overturned
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
.
epa
has
interpreted
the
decision
as
invalidating
only
those
portions
of
the
ban
for
products
that
were
manufactured
or
imported
at
the
time
of
the
decision

remaining
legitimacy

the

are
declining
rapidly

the

covers
(
but
is
not
limited
to
)
the
following
activities
involving

:

,
removal
,

the
scope
and
application
remain
generally
unchanged
from
the
proposal
and
earlier
standard
.
however
,
3
issues
arose
.
first
,
new
language
,
proposed
in
1990
is
retained
in
the
final

`

coverage
under
this
standard
shall
be
based
on
the
nature
of
the
work
operation
involving
asbestos
exposure
,
not
on
the
primary
activity
of
the
employer
'
this
point
was
made
clearly
in
the
preamble
to
the
1986
standards
;
however
,
it
was
not
specifically
stated
in
the
regulatory
text
and
subsequently
some
confusion
arose
among
the
regulated
community
.
therefore
,
it
is
included
as
a
clarification
of
the
intended
application
of
the
standards
.
asbestos
work
which
involves
removal
,
repair
,
maintenance
or
demolition
is
therefore
explicitly
regulated
by
the
construction
standard
even
if
such
work
is
performed
within
a
facility
otherwise
regulated
under
the
general
industry
standard
.
certain
commenters
stated
that
maintenance
and
custodial
work
should
not
be
regulated
by
the
construction
standard
,
because
they
are
not
construction
operations
.
osha
notes
that
it
has
made
a
distinction
between
maintenance
and
custodial
work
,
that
maintenance
work
is
covered
in
the
construction
and
shipyard
employment
standards
,
and
that
custodial
work
is
covered
in
all
three
standards
,
when
it
is
incidental
to
work
otherwise
covered
by
a
standard
.
naturally
occurring
asbestos
in
soil
:
prior
to
the
publication
of
the
1990
asbestos
proposal
,
osha
received
submissions
describing
asbestos
deposits
which
occur
as
natural
formations
in
the
us
.
and
that
when
disturbed
,
for
example
during
earthmoving
projects
or
during
mining
operations
,
drilling
,
blasting
or
sawing
operations
,
the
asbestos
in
the
deposit
can
become
airborne
and
expose
workers
to
significant
levels
of
asbestos
fibers
(
ex
.
310
,
311
.
the
agency
proposed
to
clarify
that
such
activities
were
covered
under
its
asbestos
construction
standard
and
that
methods
of
control
were
to
be
employed
to
avoid
worker
exposure
during
disturbances
of
naturally
occurring
asbestos
deposits
.
osha
sought
additional
information
regarding
any
additional
provisions
it
would
adopt
to
protect
workers
engaged
in
these
activities
.
in
the
proposal
,
the
agency
also
requested
any
information
on
appropriate
methods
to
use
to
determine
the
presence
of
asbestos
in
soils
,
the
effectiveness
of
wet
and
or
other
methods
to
control
worker
exposures
and
information
on
effective
decontamination
methods
for
exposed
workers
.
