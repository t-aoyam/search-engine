summary
:
the
united

environmental

agency
is
granting
an
exemption
to
the
detroitann
detroit

ozone
nonattainment
area
from
applicable
oxides
of
nitrogen
(
no
)
)
requirements
found
in
the
clean
air
act
(
act
.
approval
of
the
exemption
would
apply
for
various
no
including
adoption
and
implementation
of
regulations
addressing
general
conformity
,
transportation
conformity
,
inspection
and
maintenance
,
reasonably
available
control
technology
,
and
new
source
review
.
a
no
exemption
request
was
submitted
by
the
state
of
michigan
on
11/12/1993
.
a
subsequent
letter
dated
05/31/1994
clarified
this
earlier
submittal
.
this
request
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
detroitann
detroit
ann
arbor
area
has
not
monitored
a
violation
of
the
ozone
standard
for
a
3year
year
period
;
1991
to
1993
.
given
this
monitoring
data
,
michigan
may
petition
for
an
exemption
from
the
no
requirements
based
on
a
demonstration
that
additional
reductions
of
no
would
not
contribute
to
attainment
of
the
ozone
standard
.
the
rationale
for
this
approval
is
set
forth
in
this
final

of
intent
to
comment

background
on
11/12/1993
the
state
of
michigan
submitted
a
petition
to
the
epa
requesting
that
the
detroitann
detroit
ann
arbor
ozone
nonattainment
area
be
exempted
from
the
requirement
to
implement
no
ract
controls
pursuant
to
section
182f
)
of
the
act
.
the
exemption
request
is
based
upon
monitoring
data
which
demonstrate
that
the
ozone
standard
has
been
attained
in
the
detroitann
detroit
ann
arbor
area
for
a
3year
year
period
;
1991
through
1993

if
additional

in
an
area
that
did
not
implement
the
section
182f
)
no
requirements
,
but
did
attain
the
ozone
standard
,
it
is
clear
that
the
additional
no
reductions
required
by
section
182f
)
would
not
contribute
to
attainment
.
in
its
submittal
,
the
state
included
data
from
ozone
monitors
for
the
most
recently
recorded
years
,
19911993
.
these
data
showed
that
over
this
3year
year
period
a
violation
of
the
ozone
standard
was
not
monitored
in
the
detroitann

this
is
the
main
criterion
by
which
epa
judges

fact

has
submitted
adequate
monitoring
data
showing
no
violations
of
the
ozone

over
the
last
3
years
in
the
area
,
epa
finds
that
the
state
submittal
is
approvable

demonstration
cannot
be
approved
if
there
is
evidence
,
such
as

showing
that
the
no

would
interfere
with
attainment

maintenance
in
the
area

for
exemption

in
any
downwind
areas
.
no
such
evidence
exists
.
iii
.
final
action
the
epa
is
granting
the
detroitann

upon
the
evidence
provided

the
state
and
the
states

with
the

outlined
in

in

however
,
it
should
be
noted
that
this

is
being
granted
on
a
contingent
basis
;
ie
,
the
