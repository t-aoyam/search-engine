outside

can
be
introduced
into
a
building
through
the
ventilation

windows
.
outside
air
contaminants
include
vehicular
exhausts
,
industrial
emissions
,
microbiologicals
,

inside
air
contaminants
are
emitted
from
building
materials
and
furnishings
,
appliances
,
office
equipment
and
supplies
,
biological
organisms
,
and
of

,
pollutants
introduced
by
the
building
occupants

inside

include

,
volatile

,
combustion

such
as

the

can
