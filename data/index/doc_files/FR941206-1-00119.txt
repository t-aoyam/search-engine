subpart
201201
requires
agencies
to
perform
an
analysis
of
alternatives
based
on
the
requirements
analysis
to
determine
the
most
advantageous
alternative
that
will
meet
their
needs
.
like
the
requirements
analysis
,
the
analysis
of
alternatives
must
be
`
commensurate
with
the
size
and
complexity
of
the
agencys
need
.
as
indicated
in
§
20120
203
,
gsas
intention
was
that
agencies
only
include
in
the
analysis
of
alternatives
those
alternatives
that
are
truly
feasible
to
implement
.
it
has
come
to
our
attention
,
however
,
that
some
agencies
are
analyzing
all
alternatives
,
whether
or
not
they
are
feasible
in
the
specific
circumstance
.
this
unnecessarily
complicates
and
lengthens
the
acquisition
process
.
accordingly
,
§
20120
202
,
which
states
the
firmr
policy
on
performing
analyses
of
alternatives
,
is
being
revised
to
emphasize
that
agencies
should
limit
the
number
of
alternatives
analyzed
to
those
that
are
feasible
to
implement
.
other
changes
are
also
being
made
to
this
subpart
.
section
20120
203
is
being
revised
to
increase
from
$
50000
to
$
1000000
the
threshold
for
performing
a
more
detailed
analysis
of
alternatives
.
agencies
will
be
given
the
option
of
performing
either
an
analysis
using
the
present
value
of
money
if
the
estimated
amount
of
their
proposed
acquisition
is
less
than
$
1000000
or
an
analysis
that
demonstrates
that
the
benefits
of
the
acquisition
will
outweigh
the
costs
.
this
change
will
help
to
streamline
the
acquisition
process
by
reducing
documentation
requirements
for
a
greater
number
of
smaller
acquisitions
.
additionally
,
paragraph
20120
203
)
is
being
revised
to
delete
the
title
of
omb
circular
a94
and
to
move
it
to
the
new
§
2014
003
.
(
u
)
section
20120
203
paragraph
(
d2
)
is
revised
to
permit
agency
heads
to
grant
exceptions
to
fedstds
fed
stds
provided
gsa
is
notified
at
least
30
days
prior
to
any
use
of
the
excepted
fedstd
fed
std
,
eg
,
in
a
solicitation
.
this
change
empowers
agencies
to
accomplish
their
missions
more
effectively
.
(
v
)
section
20120
304
paragraphs
(
a
)
and
b1
)
deal
with
capability
and
performance
validation
.
they
are
revised
to
require
use
of
validation
techniques
that
are
more
economical
to
government
and
industry
than
use
of
a
benchmark
or
an
operational
capability
demonstration
(
ocd
.
in
the
early
years
of
computing
,
comprehensive
benchmarks
,
stress
tests
,
and
ocds
were
useful
for
validating
reliability
,
performance
and
other
requirements
.
in
todays
mature
industry
,
the
reliability
and
stability
of
the
marketplace
offerings
are
much
higher
.
also
,
there
is
substantial
empirical
data
available
from
independent
sources
to
assist
agencies
in
assessing
how
a
proposed
system
will
perform
in
their
environment
and
with
their
workloads
.
as
a
result
,
the
use
of
benchmarks
or
ocds
may
not
be
the
most
advantageous
approach
in
many
acquisitions
.
this
is
more
likely
to
be
the
case
for
those
acquisitions
that
do
not
require
customized
hardware
and
or
software
.
agencies
will
not
be
required
to
select
the
most
economical
technique
available
that
will
meet
their
minimum
needs
.
additionally
,
§
20120
304
)
is
revised
to
delete
the
adjective
`
actual
'
in
front
of
the
word
`
requirements
.
the
world
`
actual
'
caused
some
confusion
about
the
meaning
of
`
when
a
benchmark
is
used
as
part
of
performance
validation
,
agencies
shall
ensure
,
that
the
fip
software
selected
for
benchmarks
is
representative
of
actual
requirements
*
*
*
*
*
'
in
fact
,
agencies
acquire
systems
to
accommodate
a
workload
over
a
life
cycle
of
some
years
.
any
agencys
definition
of
its
requirements
at
the
time
of
acquisition
is
its
best
estimate
of
workload
that
will
ultimately
occur
over
the
ensuing
years
.
(
w
)
section
20120
305
is
revised
to
emphasize
the
agency
requirement
for
the
submission
of
post
delegation
information
to
gas
for
specific
delegations
.
with
the
increased
emphasis
on
results
oriented
performance
,
gas
will
seek
information
demonstrating
that
agencies
are
obtaining
the
benefits
cited
in
their
agency
procurement
requests
.
(
x
)
section
20121
201
paragraph
(
b
)
is
revised
to
reflect
the
current
name
and
symbol
of
a
gsa
organization
.
(
y
)
section
20121
301
paragraphs
(
a
)
and
(
d
)
are
revised
to
delete
references
to
omb
circular
a130
,
appendix
iii
.
(
z
)
section
20121
401
paragraph
(
c
)
is
revised
to
remove
references
to
omb
circular
a130
,
appendix
ii
,
which
is
proposed
for
revision
;
and
to
remove
the
title
of
the
circular
since
it
appears
in
the
new
§
2014
003
.
(
aa
)
section
20121
43
is
amended
to
change
the
annual
report
date
from
november
30
to
october
20
for
reporting
the
dollar
amount
charged
to
users
for
the
sharing
of
excess
fip
resources
.
this
earlier
due
date
allows
for
more
timely
submission
of
gsas
consolidated
governmentwide
report
to
congress
.
