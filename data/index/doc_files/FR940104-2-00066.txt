considering
the
existing

proposed

the
licensee
,
the
likelihood
of
damage
to
the
exposed
auxiliary
sws
lines
from
postulated
missiles
generated
by
natural
phenomena
is
minimal
.
also
,
based
on
the
compensatory
measures
provided
,
assurance
exists
that
the
ability
to
bring
the
plant
to
a
safe
shutdown
will
be
maintained
following
any
natural
phenomena
,
including
tornadoes
or
other
severe
weather
which
could
result
in
airborne
missiles
.
therefore
,
there
is
reasonable
assurance
that
the
proposed
gdc2
gdc
exemption
will
present
no
undue
risk
to
public
health
and
safety
.

the
commission
has
determined
,
pursuant
to
10
cfr
50
12
,
that
special
circumstances
as
set
forth
in
10
cfr
50
12
.
the
exemption
would
provide
only
temporary
relief
from
the
applicable
regulation
(
gdc2
gdc
.
the
exemption
is
requested
for
a
specific
time
period
after
which
the
facility
would
again
be
in
conformance
with
all
the
requirements
of
gdc2
gdc
.
the
licensee
has
made
good
faith
efforts
in
considering
alternatives
to
the
exemption
requests
and
has
concluded
that
the
phase
1
,
stage
4
sws
refurbishment
and
restoration
program
can
only
be
conducted
without
the
subject
exemption
during
a
period
when
both
na1amp2
are
shut
down
and
defueled
.
the
impact
of
scheduling
such
a

outage
would
have
significant
consequences
in
terms
of
power
supply
,
fuel

,

and
replacement
power
costs
.
finally
,
the
exemption
will
indirectly
result
in
benefits
to
the
public
from
increased
reliability
of
the
upgraded

related

.
based
on
the
above
and
on
review
of
the
licensees
submittal
,
as
summarized
in
the
safety
evaluation
dated
december
27
,
1993
,
the
nrc
staff
concludes
that
the
likelihood
of
unacceptable
damage
to
the
exposed
auxiliary
sw
lines
due
to
tornadoeborne
tornadoe
borne
missiles
during
the
exemption
period
is
low
.
based
on
the
low
probability
of
unacceptable
events
,
coupled
with
the
comprehensive
compensatory
measures
which
the
licensee
has
committed
to
,
the
nrc
staff
finds
the
proposed
exemption
from
gedc2
gedc
acceptable
.
iv
accordingly
,
the
commission
has
determined
that
,
pursuant
to
10
cfr
50
12
,
the
subject
exemption
is
authorized
by
law
,
will
not
present
an
undue
risk
to
the
public
health
and
safety
,
and
is
consistent
with
the
common
defense
and
security
.
the
commission
further
determines
that
special
circumstances
,
as
provided
in
10
cfr
50
12
,
are
present
justifying
the
exemption
;
namely
,
that
the
exemption
would
provide
only
temporary
relief
from
the
applicable
regulations
and
that
the
licensee
has
made
good
faith
efforts
to
comply
with
the
regulations
.
therefore
,
the
commission
hereby
approves
the
following
exemption
:
na1amp2
may
operate
without
conforming
to
the
requirements
of
gdc2
gdc
as
they
apply
to
the
buried
portions
of
the
auxiliary
sws
lines
from
lake
anna
to
the
main
sws
header
providing
that
compensatory
measures
as
described
herein
are
continued
for
the
period
of
the
exemption
.
pursuant
to
10
cfr
51

,
the
commission
has
determined
that
granting
the
above
exemption
will
have
no
significant
impact
on
the
quality
of
the
human
environment
