rule
the
transportation
conformity
final
rule
,
entitled
`
criteria
and
procedures
for
determining
conformity
to
state
or
federal
implementation
plans
of
transportation
plans
,
programs
,
and
projects
funded
or
approved
under
title
23
usc
.
or
the
federal
transit
act
'
was
published
in
the
federal
register
on
11/24/1993
(
58
fr
62188
.
this
action
was
required
under
section
176c4
)
of
the
clean
air
act
,
as
amended
in
1990
.
conformity
to
an
implementation
plan
is
defined
in
the
clean
air
act
as
conformity
to
an
implementation
plans
purpose
of
eliminating
or
reducing
the
severity
and
number
of
violations
of
the
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
and
achieving
expeditious
attainment
of
such
standards
.
in
addition
,
federal
activities
may
not
cause
or
contribute
to
new
violations
of
air
quality
standards
,
exacerbate
existing
violations
,
or
interfere
with
timely
attainment
or
required
interim
emission
reductions
towards
attainment
.
the
transportation
conformity
final
rule
establishes
the
process
by
which
the
federal
highway
administration
and
the
federal
transit
administration
of
the
united
states
department
of
transportation
and
metropolitan
planning
organizations
determine
the
conformity
of
highway
and
transit
projects
.
under
the
rule
,
conformity
applies
in
nonattainment
and
maintenance
areas
.
the
transportation
conformity
rule
requires
ozone
nonattainment
and
maintenance
areas
to
perform
a
regional
emissions
analysis
of
motor
vehicle
nox
emissions
in
order
to
determine
the
conformity
of
transportation
plans
and
programs
.
this
analysis
must
demonstrate
that
the
no
emissions
which
would
result
from
the
transportation
system
if
the
proposed
transportation
plan
and
program
were
implemented
are
within
the
total
allowable
level
of
no
emissions
from
highway
and
transit
motor
vehicles
(
motor
vehicle
emissions
budget
,
as
identified
in
a
submitted
or
approved
attainment
demonstration
or
maintenance
plan
.
until
an
attainment
demonstration
or
(
for
nonclassifiable
areas
)
a
maintenance
plan
is
approved
by
epa
,
the
regional
emissions
analysis
of
the
transportation
system
must
also
satisfy
the
`
build/nobuild
build/no
build
test
'
that
is
,
the
analysis
must
demonstrate
that
emissions
from
the
transportation
system
if
the
proposed
transportation
plan
and
program
were
implemented
would
be
less
than
the
emissions
from
the
transportation
system
if
only
the
previously
applicable
transportation
plan
and
program
were
implemented
.
furthermore
,
the
regional
emissions
analysis
must
show
that
emissions
from
the
transportation
system
if
the
transportation
plan
and
program
were
implemented
would
be
lower
than
1990
levels
by
any
nonzero
amount
.
the
transportation
conformity
rule
as
currently
written
provides
for
an
exemption
from
these
requirements
with
respect
to
no
if
the
administrator
determines
under
section
182f
)
of
the
clean
air
act
that
additional
reductions
of
no
would
not
contribute
to
attainment
.
this
exemption
is
explicitly
referred
to
and
is
described
in
similar
language
in
§
51
394
)
(
the
`
applicability
'
section
of
the
rule
)
and
in
the
preamble
(
58
fr
62197
,
november
24
,
1993
.
the
language
is
repeated
in
the
provisions
of
the
rule
regarding
the
motor
vehicle
emissions
budget
test
(
51
428
)
and
the
`
build/nobuild
build/no
build
'
test
(
51
436
,
51
438
,
although
clean
air
act
section
182f
)
is
not
specifically
mentioned
.
section
182f
)
of
the
clean
air
act
contains
requirements
forand
in
some
cases
,
exemptions
formajor
stationary
no
sources
in
marginal
and
above
ozone
nonattainment
areas
and
in
an
ozone
transport
region
.
epa
guidance
for
application
of
section
182f
)
in
these
areas
is
briefly
described
and
referenced
in
the
next
section
of
this
preamble
.
because
the
transportation
conformity
rule
covers
all
nonattainment
areasincluding
nonclassifiable
ozone
nonattainment
areas
(
(
ie
,
submarginal
,
transitional
,
incomplete
no
data
areas
)
that
are
not
necessarily
covered
under
section
182fcorresponding
guidance
is
needed
for
applying
in
these
nonclassifiable
ozone
nonattainment
areas
the
section
182f
)
no
exemption
referenced
in
the
transportation
conformity
rule
.
this
guidance
is
described
below
(
section
ii
,
`
epa
policy
)
and
is
consistent
with
the
existing
guidance
that
applies
to
the
marginal
and
above
areas
outside
an
ozone
transport
region
.
the
substantive
test
for
a
no
exemption
is
the
same
in
both
sets
of
areas
,
but
in
nonclassifiable
ozone
nonattainment
areas
the
effect
of
a
no
exemption
is
limited
solely
to
the
issue
of
whether
such
areas
may
be
exempted
from
meeting
the
no
requirements
of
the
transportation
conformity
rule
.
b
.
general
conformity
on
11/30/1993
(
58
fr
63214
,
epa
published
the
general
conformity
final
rule
,
entitled
`
determining
conformity
of
general
federal
actions
to
state
or
federal
implementation
plans
'
this
action
was
required
under
section
176c4
)
of
the
clean
air
act
,
as
amended
in
1990
.
like
the
transportation
conformity
rule
,
the
general
conformity
rule
exempts
an
area
from
considering
no
emissions
if
the
area
has
been
exempted
under
section
182f
)
of
the
clean
air
act
(
see
definition
of
`
precursors
of
a
criteria
pollutant
'
58
fr
63248
.
in
order
to
avoid
repetition
,
this
general
preamble
describes
guidance
on
no
exemptions
with
respect
to
the
transportation
conformity
rule
.
however
,
this
guidance
for
transportation
conformity
is
intended
to
also
apply
with
respect
to
general
conformity
.
