asbestos

,
largely
as
a
result
of
a
fear
of

[

building
owners
commission
asbestos
removal
in
an
attempt
to
eliminate
,
or
at
least
reduce
,
the
probability
of
future
lawsuits
.
although
the
likelihood
of
future
lawsuits
is
uncertain
,
building
owners
presumably
calculate
that
the
`
expected
'
cost
of
such
lawsuits
would
run
over
$
4
billion
a
year
,
on
average
(
using
the
20year
year
forecast
given
above
.
if
an
individual
building
owner
spends
$
50000
to
remove
the
asbestos
from
a
building
to
avert
potential
future
lawsuits
,
the
owner
may
be
implicitly
calculating
that
such
an
expenditure
will
effectively
eliminate
a
5
percent
chance
that
the
owner
will
have
to
pay
out
over
$
1
million
in
a
lawsuit
.
unfortunately
,
the
evidence
suggests
that
such
attempts
to
reduce
the
probability
of
lawsuits
,
in
the
absence
of
proper
protections
,
may
be
in
vain
.
as
discussed
elsewhere
in
this
benefits
section
,
recent
evidence
suggests
that
such
removal
attempts
,
in
the
absence
of
proper
protections
,
may
actually
increase
building
occupants
'
exposure
to
asbestos
.
ultimately
,
exposure
to
asbestos
is
the
impetus
for
lawsuits
.
while
it
might
be
arguable
,
from
an
exposure
standpoint
,
that
the
building
owners
most
economical
choice
would
be
to
encapsulate
existing
asbestos
,
the
path
of
minimizing
liability
is
driving
many
building
owners
to
actually
remove
the
asbestos
.
it
appears
that
successful
avoidance
of
liability
is
guaranteed
only
by
taking
all
feasible
measures
to
minimize
exposures
to
occupants
during
removal
.
thus
,
spending
an
additional
$
5000
for
worker
health
to
complete
a
$
50000
removal
operation
could
ultimately
prevent
a
$
1
million
lawsuit
.
this
analysis
suggests
,
then
,
that
the
asbestos
standards
requirements
for
engineering
controls
and
work
practices
,
including
the
use
of
negative
pressure
enclosures
and
other
isolation
efforts
,
if
successful
in
averting
lawsuits
,
would
have
a
market
value
of
upwards
of
$
4
billion
a
year
(
the
minimum
value
of
averting
lawsuits
.
note
that
there
need
not
actually
be
over
$
4
billion
a
year
in
lawsuits
;
the
market
behavior
of
owners
willing
to
pay
for
asbestos
abatement
simply
reflects
the
market
value
to
those
owners
of
minimizing
the
likelihood
of
lawsuits
,
in
effect
acting
as
a
type
of
insurance
policy
.
moreover
,
as
discussed
above
,
it
is
not
necessary
that
such
efforts
be
100
percent
successful
in
preventing
lawsuitsthe
estimated
effectiveness
in
reducing
the
probability
or
value
of
potential
lawsuits
possesses
considerable
value
.
additionally
,
it
is
not
necessary
that
such
controls
dramatically
reduce
exposures
to
building
occupants
,
although
oshas
analysis
indicates
that
they
will
,
as
long
as
it
is
established
that
all
feasible
measures
were
taken
to
minimize
asbestos
exposures
to
building
occupants
so
that
owner
negligence
cannot
be
the
grounds
of
a
lawsuit
.
if
instituting
the
asbestos
controls
mandated
by
the
osha
standard
were
only
marginally
effective
in
reducing
the
probability
of
lawsuits
,
say
by
10
percent
,
the
use
of
these
preventative
measures
would
still
possess
a
value
of
over
$
400
million
.
