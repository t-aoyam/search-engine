fully
conductive

are
required
to
reduce
fiber

is
commonly
set

calibrate
each
sampling
pump
before
and
after
sampling
with
a
calibration
cassette
inline
in
line
(
note
:
this
calibration
cassette
should
be
from
the
same
lot
of

used
for
sampling
.
use
a
primary
standard
(
eg
.
bubble
burette

to
calibrate
each
pump
.
if
possible
,
calibrate
at
the
sampling

note
:
if

calibration
is
not
possible
,
environmental
influences
may
affect
the
flow

the
extent
is
dependent
on
the
type

consult
with
the
pump
manufacturer
to
determine
dependence
on
environmental
influences
.
if
the
pump
is
affected
by
temperature
and
pressure
changes
,
use
the
formula
in
appendix
b
to
this
section
to
calculate
the
actual
flow
rate
.
526
.
connect
each
pump
to
the
base
of
each
sampling
cassette
with
flexible
tubing
.
remove
the
end

of
each
cassette
and
take

assure
that
each
sample
cassette
is
held
open
side
down
in
the
employees
breathing
zone
during
sampling
.
the
distance
from
the
nose
mouth
of
the
employee
to
the
cassette
should
be
about
10
cm
.
secure
the
cassette
on
the
collar
or
lapel
of
the
employee
using
spring
clips
or
other
similar
devices

the
most
significant
problem
when
sampling
for

is
overloading

caution
:
do
not

may
be
necessary
when
there

,
observe
the
filter
with
a
small
flashlight

if
there
is
a
visible

.
blank
samples
are
used
to
determine
if
any
contamination
has
occurred
during
sample
handling
.
prepare
two
blanks
for
the
first
1

20
samples
.
for
sets
containing
greater
than
20

,
prepare

.
handle
blank
samples
in
the
same
manner
as
air
samples
with
one
exception
:
do
not
draw
any
air
through
the
blank
samples
.
open
the
blank

in
the
place
where
the

cassettes
are
mounted
on
the

.
hold
it
open
for
about

close
and
seal
the

appropriately
.
store

.
immediately
after
sampling
,
close
and
seal
each
cassette
with
the

and
plastic
plugs
.
do
not
touch
or
puncture
the
filter
membrane
as
this
will
invalidate
the
analysis
.
52

.
attach
a
seal
(

osha
or
equivalent
)
around
each

in
such
a
way
as
to
secure
the
end
cap
plug
and

plug
.
tape
the
ends
of
the
seal
together
since
the
seal
is
not
long
enough
to
be
wrapped

.
also
wrap
tape
around
the

to
keep
the
seal
secure
