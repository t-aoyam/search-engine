nmfs
consulted
with
the
pacific
fishery
management
council
(
pfmc
)
pursuant
to
section
7
of
the
esa
to
evaluate
the
potential
effects
of
the
proposed
pacific
ocean
salmon
fishery
management
plan
(

)
on
winterrun
winter

.
a
biological
opinion
was
issued
to
the
pfmc
on
03/01/1991
,
that
concluded
management
of
the
salmon
fishery
under
the
pacific
ocean
salmon
fmp
was
not
likely
to
jeopardize
the
continued
existence
of
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
an
incidental
take
statement
was
also
issued
with
the
opinion
that
authorized
a
limited
incidental
take
of
winterrun
winter

chinook
salmon
by
the
ocean
fishery
(

.
nmfs
has
also
consulted
with
the
council
concerning
implementation
of
amendment
4
to
the
pacific
coast
groundfish
fmp
.
the
opinion
issued
by
nmfs
concluded
that
implementation
of
the
fmp
would
not
jeopardize
the
continued
existence
of
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
as
a
result
of
incidental
bycatch
of
salmon
in
the
fishery
.
nmfs
will
continue
to
consult
internally
and
with
the
pfmc
,
as
appropriate
,
to
ensure
that
ocean
salmon
and
other
fishery
management
actions
do
not
jeopardize
the
continued
existence
of
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
since
1987
,
the
cdfg
has
implemented
seasonal
fishing
closures
in
the
upper
sacramento
river
and
monitored
the
recreational
salmon
catch
.
in
1990
,
the
california
fish
and
game
commission
adopted
regulations
that
prohibited
the
retention
of
salmon
in
the
sacramento
river
when
adult
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
are
present
.
this
closure
has
virtually
eliminated
the
taking
of
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
by
recreational
fishermen
.
nmfs
will
continue
to
coordinate
with
cdfg
concerning

restrictions
.
scientific
studies
in
1991
,
nmfs
issued
an
esa
section
10
scientific
research
permit
to
the
fws
to
conduct
several
scientific
research
studies
on
sacramento
river
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
the
fwss
northern
central
valley
fishery
resource
office
published
a
report
in
early
1993
summarizing
their
1992
activities
under
the
permit
.
the
results
from
the
juvenile
monitoring
program
,
the
hatchery
propagation
program
,
and
the
temperature
tolerance
experiments
are
expected
to
significantly
contribute
to
nmfs
efforts
to
protect
and
recover
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
cdfg
and
fws
also
conduct
annual
spawning
distribution
surveys
of
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
in
the
upper
sacramento
river
and
develop
estimates
of
the
annual
spawning
run
size
based
on
counts
of
fish
passing
the
dam
.
cdfg
conducts
aerial
surveys
each
year
to
count
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
spawning
redds
and
determine
their
distribution
in
the
upper
river
.
the
fws
also
counts
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
redds
in
an
index
area
in
the
vicinity
of
redding
.
in
03/19/1993
,
nmfs
modified
the
fwss
scientific
research
to
authorize
the
directed
take
and
sacrifice
of
codedwire
coded
wire
tagged
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
juveniles
produced
at
coleman
national
fish
hatchery
and
collected
during
monitoring
studies
in
the
sacramento
river
,
the
delta
,
and
at
the
state
and
federal
water
export
facilities
in
the
southern
delta
.
the
purpose
of
the
study
was
to
determine
growth
rates
of
juvenile
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
produced
at
the
hatchery
and
released
into
the
wild
,
and
to
help
verify
the
size
criteria
developed
by
cdfg
to
separate
and
identify
juvenile
chinook
salmon
by
race
.
under
the
terms
of
the
05/19/1988
ten
point
restoration
plan
for
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
,
the
fws
agreed
to
fund
and
implement
a
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
propagation
program
at
the
hatchery
.
prior
to
1991
,
this
program
was
unsuccessful
.
however
,
in
1991
the
fws
was
able
to
successfully
hold
and
spawn
six
female
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
despite
the
low
numbers
of
fish
available
(
only
22
,
and
produce
and
release
about
11000
juveniles
into
the
sacramento
river
near
redding
,
california
.
in
1992
,
the
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
spawning
run
size
was
substantially
higher
(
1180
fish
,
more
adults
were
collected
for
broodstock
use
,
and
a
total
of
approximately
28000
juvenile
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
with
tags
were
released
into
the
upper
sacramento
river
in
late
01/19/1993
.
the
fws
continued
this
program
in
1993
using
approximately
17
wild
adults
and
is
currently
rearing
in
excess
of
20000
juveniles
at
the
hatchery
.
the
surviving
juveniles
will
eventually
be
tagged
and
released
into
the
upper
sacramento
.
this
marking
program
is
expected
to
provide
information
on
the
timing
of
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
outmigration
and
growth
.
in
addition
,
marked
fish
that
return
to
the
upper
sacramento
river
to
spawn
in
the
future
will
be
easily
distinguishable
from
wild
fish
,
thereby
allowing
the
fws
to
assess
the
effectiveness
of
this
supplementation
program
and
ensure
that
hatchery
produced
adults
are
not
mated
with
each
other
.
the
marking
program
may
also
provide
additional
information
concerning
the
ocean
harvest
of
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
nmfs
is
currently
conducting
a
section
7
consultation
with
the
fws
to
address
the
longterm
long
term
effects
of
this
propagation
program
,
as
well
as
a
proposed
captive
broodstock
program
,
and
other
existing
propagation
programs
at
the
hatchery
,
on
the
wild
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
population
.
nmfs
expects
to
conclude
consultation
and
issue
a
biological
opinion
to
the
fws
before
the
end
of
1993
.
