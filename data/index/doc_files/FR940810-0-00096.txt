the

objected
to

reasons

first
,
because
it
was
held
as
close
as
possible
to

and
did
not
fit

they
felt
there
was
potential
for

;
and
second
,
they
questioned
how
effective
it
would

and
dropped
it

osha
agrees
;
the

the
other

method

osha
notes
,
however
,
that

mini
enclosures
are
manufactured
by
other
companies
and
this
rule
does
not
limit
use
of
the
device
to
any
particular

.
in
an
accompanying

paper

the
portable

is
described
as
:
`
a

extendable

that

a

the
submission
also
contained
air
sampling
data
obtained
during
use
of
this
apparatus
while
removing
ceiling
tiles
from
a
virginia
building
.
the
results
indicated
that
fiber
levels
averaged
less
than
0

f
cc
.
however
,
as
pointed
out
by
bctd
in
its
posthearing
hearing
brief
there
was
failure
to
achieve
clearance
(
0
01
f
cc
under
ahera
)
in
this
building
following
use
of
the
device
which
`
necessitated
evacuation
of
the
work
areas
on
several
occasions
'
as
explained
elsewhere
in
this
document
,
osha
is
not
requiring
ahera
clearance
levels
to
be
achieved
for
class
i
work
.
if
such
requirements
must
be
met
,
the
employer
should
employ
all
applicable
controls
which
in
some
cases
may
exceed
those
in
these
standards

osha
has
found
that
the
exposure
potential
from
class

work
is
generally
lower
than
for
class

work
,
when
removal
is
conducted
under

similar

the

experienced

the

are
less

this
is
similar
to
the

allowed
these
