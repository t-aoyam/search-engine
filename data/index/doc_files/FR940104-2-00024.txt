summary

this
is
a
floodplain
statement
of
findings
for
the
proposed
sanitary
sewer
project
at
oak
ridge
national
laboratory
(
ornl
)
prepared
in
accordance
with
10
cfr
1022
.
doe
proposes
to
upgrade
the
sanitary
sewer
system
to
provide
adequate
service
in
the
main
complex
area
and
outlying
regions
of
the
oak
ridge
reservation
.
only
certain
sections
of
two
subprojects
would
be
located
in
a
100year
year
floodplain
.
the
east
area
sewer
main
subproject
would
include
installing
approximately
2900
linear
feet
of
new
sewer
line
that
would
lie
within
the
100year
year
floodplain
of
white
oak
creek
located
near
oak
ridge
,
tennessee
.
this
line
would
be
installed
in
a
trench
about
2
feet
deep
.
after
installation
,
the
trench
would
be
backfilled
and
compacted
.
finally
,
the
area
would
be
graded
to
original
contour
and
seeded
.
the
sewer
main
to
outlying
areas
subproject
would
install
approximately
8300
linear
feet
of
new
pipeline
.
the
new
pipeline
would
be
located
in
the
100year
year
floodplain
of
white
oak
creek
only
where
the
pipeline
crosses
white
oak
creek
and
an
unnamed
tributary
feeding
the
creek
from
the
west
.
at
these
crossings
,
the
pipeline
would
be
placed
on
the
existing
causeways
and
adjacent
to
the
roadway
.
after
installation
,
the
area
would
be
returned
to
the
original
condition
.
doe
prepared
a
floodplain
and
wetlands
assessment
describing
the
effects
,
alternatives
,
and
measures
designed
to
avoid
or
minimize
potential
harm
to
or
within
the
affected
floodplain
.
doe
will
endeavor
to
allow
15
days
of
public
review
after
publication
of
the
statement
of
findings
before
implementing
the
proposed
action

supplementary
information
:
this
is
a
floodplain
statement
of
findings
for
the
proposed
sanitary
sewer
upgrade
project
at
ornl
.
a
notice
of
floodplain
wetlands
involvement
was
published
in
the
federal
register
on
10/04/1993
(
58
fr
51624
.
doe
proposes
to
upgrade
the
sanitary
sewer
system
to
provide
adequate
service
in
the
main
complex
area
and
outlying
regions
of
the
reservation
.
these
upgrades
are
needed
because
of
the
deterioration
in
portions
of
the
system
,
which
are
approaching
50years
years
of
age
;
restrictive
bends
in
sections
of
the
piping
;
excessive
surface
and
subsurface
infiltration
during
heavy
rains
;
infiltration
of
ground
water
;
high
cost
and
potential
environmental
damage
of
collecting
,
pumping
,
and
hauling
sanitary
waste
from
holding
tanks
in
the
outlying
areas
;
and
lack
of
reserve
capacity
during
peak
periods
of
use
.
of
the
proposed
upgrades
,
only
certain
sections
of
two
subprojects
would
be
located
in
a
100year
year
floodplain
.
these
subprojects
would
be
the
east
area
sewer
main
and
the
sewer
main
to
outlying
areas
.
the
east
area
sewer
main
subproject
would
include
the
installation
of
approximately
2900
linear
feet
of
new
sewer
line
that
would
lie
within
the
100year
year
floodplain
of
white
oak
creek
.
this
line
would
be
installed
in
a
trench
about
2
feet
deep
.
after
installation
,
the
trench
would
be
backfilled
and
compacted
.
finally
,
the
area
would
be
graded
to
original
contour
and
seeded
.
currently
,
facilities
in
the
outlying
areas
of
the
plant
use
either
collection
tanks
or
septic
systems
.
the
waste
in
the
tanks
is
routinely
pumped
into
trucks
and
taken
to
the
main
treatment
plant
.
the
cost
of
collection
and
maintenance
of
the
sanitary
facilities
in
the
outlying
areas
continues
to
increase
.
additionally
,
this
existing
system
can
negatively
affect
the
environment
.
the
objective
of
the
sewer
main
to
outlying
areas
subproject
is
to
directly
connect
,
via
a
pipeline
,
these
facilities
to
the
main
sewage
treatment
plant
.
approximately
8300
linear
feet
of
new
pipeline
would
be
installed
.
the
new
pipeline
would
be
located
in
the
100year
year
floodplain
of
white
oak
creek
only
where
the
pipeline
crosses
white
oak
creek
and
an
unnamed
tributary
feeding
the
creek
from
the
west
.
at
these
crossings
,
the
pipeline
would
be
placed
on
the
existing
causeways
and
adjacent
to
the
roadway
.
after
installation
,
the
area
would
be
returned
to
the
original
condition
.
since
the
main
facilities
of
ornl
were
built
along
white
oak
creek
,
some
upgrade
projects
naturally
fall
within
the
floodplain
.
this
is
the
case
with
the
new
sewer
line
in
the
east
area
.
the
only
practical
route
lies
between
white
oak
creek
and
southside
avenue
,
an
area
within
the
floodplain
.
the
creek
also
separates
the
main
complex
from
the
outlying
areas
.
thus
,
the
sewer
line
to
the
outlying
areas
must
cross
over
the
existing
causeways
to
avoid
the
installation
of
new
,
separate
crossings
.
