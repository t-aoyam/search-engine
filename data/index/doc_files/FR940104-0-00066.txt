a
state

administered
its
hazardous

program
entirely
in

of

the
federal

no

applied

and
epa
could
not

located
in

when
new
,
more
stringent
federal
requirements
were
promulgated
or
enacted
,
the
state
was
obligated
to
enact
equivalent
authority
within
specified
time
frames
.
new
federal
requirements
did
not
take
effect
in
an
authorized
state
until
the
state
adopted

in

at

that
they
take

epa
is
directed
to
implement
those
requirements
and
prohibitions
in
authorized
states
,
including
the
issuance
of
permits
,
until
the
state
is
granted
authorization
to
do
so
.
while
states
must
still
adopt
hswarelated
hswa
related
provisions
as
state
law
to
retain
final
authorization
,
the
federal
hswa
requirements
apply
in
authorized
states
in
the
interim
.
although
this
final
rule
does
not
list
,
as
hazardous
,
chlorophenolic
wastes
from
the
wood
surface
protection
industry
,
it
does
add
four
constituents
to
appendix

of
40
cfr
part
261
.
these
additions
will
not
be
effective
in
authorized
states
since
the
requirements
are
not
being
imposed
pursuant
to
hswa
.
these
requirements
will
be
effective
only
in
those
states
that
do
not
have
final
authorization
.
in
authorized
states
,
these
requirements
will
not
be
applicable
until
the
states
revise
their
programs
to
adopt
equivalent
requirements
under
state
law
.
section

)
of
epas
state
authorization
regulations
(
40
cfr
part
271
)
requires
that
states
with
final
authorization
must
modify
their
programs
to
reflect
federal
program
changes
and
submit
the
modifications
to
epa
for
approval
.
the
deadline
by
which
the
states
must
modify
their
programs
to
adopt
this
proposed
regulation
,
if
it
is
adopted
as
a
final
rule
,
will
be
determined
by
the
date
of
promulgation
of
a
final
rule
in
accordance
with
§
§
271
21
.
if
the
proposal
is
adopted
as
a
final
rule
,
table
1
at
40
cfr

will
be
amended
accordingly
.
once
epa
approves
the
modification
,
the
state
requirements
become
rcra
subtitle
c
requirements
.
states
with
authorized
rcra
programs
already
may
have
regulations
similar
to
what
is
being
finalized
in
this
rule
.
these
state
regulations
have
not
been
assessed
against
the
federal
regulations
being
proposed
today
to
determine
whether
they
meet
the
tests
for
authorization
.
thus
,
a
state
would
not
be
authorized
to
implement
these
regulations
as
rcra
requirements
until
state
program
modifications
are
submitted
to
epa
and
approved
,
pursuant
to
40
cfr
271
21
.
of
course
,
states
with
existing
regulations
that
are
not
less
stringent
than
current
federal
regulations
may
continue
to
administer
and
enforce
their
regulations
as
a
matter
of
state
law
.
it
should
be
noted
that
authorized
states
are
required
to
modify
their
programs
only
when
epa
promulgates
federal
standards
that
are
more
stringent
or
broader
in
scope
than
existing
federal
standards
.
section
3009
of
rcra
allows
states
to
impose
standards
more
stringent
than
those
in
the
federal
program
.
for
those
federal
program
changes
that
are
less
stringent
or
reduce
the
scope
of
the
federal
program
,
states
are
not
required
to
modify
their
programs
.
(
see
40
cfr
2711i
)
this
proposed
rule
,
if
finalized
,
is
neither
less
stringent
than
nor
a
reduction
in
the
scope
of
the
current
federal
program
and
,
therefore
,
states
would
be
required
to
modify
their
programs
to
retain
authorization
to
implement
and
enforce
these
regulations
.

.
regulatory
flexibility
analysis
this
final
rule
amends
the
hazardous
waste
regulations
by
adding
four
chemicals
to
appendix
viii
of
40
cfr
part
261
and
amending
sw846
by
adding
method
4010
.
these
are
impacts
with
negligible
effects
to
small
entities
.
therefore
,
there
is
no
need
to
consider
its
impacts
on
small
entities
by
preparing
a
regulatory
flexibility
analysis
.
