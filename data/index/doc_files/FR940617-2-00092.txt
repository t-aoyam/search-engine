this
section
applies
to
both
classified
and
nonclassifiable
areas
.
once
epa
makes
a
finding
under
a
separate
notice
which
grants
a
no
transportation
conformity
exemption
,
an
area
is
relieved
of
the
transportation
conformity
rules
requirements
for
regional
analysis
of
no
emissions
.
however
,
epa
plans
to
amend
the
transportation
conformity
rule
to
require
that
once
an
areas
maintenance
plan
is
approved
,
any
previously
approved
no
conformity
exemption
no
longer
applies
.
the
area
must
then
demonstrate
as
part
of
its
conformity
determinations
that
the
transportation
plan
and
tip
are
consistent
with
the
motor
vehicle
emissions
budget
for
no
where
such
a
budget
is
established
by
the
maintenance
plan
.
as
currently
written
,
none
of
the
transportation
conformity
rules
no
requirements
would
ever
apply
to
an
area
once
such
an
area
had
received
a
no
transportation
conformity
exemption
.
epa
believes
that
it
is
crucial
for
maintenance
areas
to
demonstrate
consistency
with
the
maintenance
plans
motor
vehicle
no
emissions
budget
because
that
budget
represents
the
level
of
motor
vehicle
no
emissions
needed
for
continued
maintenance
.
however
,
the
maintenance
plans
no
motor
vehicle
emissions
budget
for
the
purposes
of
transportation
conformity
will
not
necessarily
require
annual
no
emission
reductions
throughout
the
tenyear
ten
year
period
.
epa
intends
to
promptly
amend
the
conformity
rule
as
stated
above
,
so
that
no
motor
vehicle
emissions
budgets
in
maintenance
plans
will
begin
to
apply
at
the
time
or
shortly
after
those
plans
are
approved
.

is
required
by

of

or
any

for

shall

an

the

do
not
apply
for

because
it
is
not
a
