the
studies

not
demonstrate

disease
,

studies
showing
lipid
abnormalities
do
not
control
for
the

no

of
the

has
been

the

of

ulcers
in

has
not
been
sufficiently
studied
to
establish
an
association
with

.
only
one
study
(
suskind
and
hertzberg
,
1984
)
indicates
any
increase
,
and
in
that
study
it
is
difficult
to
rule
out
the
many
factors
(

,
alcoholism
,

drugs

)
known
to
be
associated
with

.
accordingly
,
the
secretary
has
found
that
there
is
no
credible
evidence
for
an
association
between
metabolic
and
digestive
disorders
(
other
than
diabetes
)
and
herbicide
exposure
,
and
he
has
determined
that
a
positive
association
does
not
exist
.
the
available
data
deal
with
two
categories
of
immune
system
disorders
:
immune
modulation
and
autoimmunity
.
many
immune
parameters
have
been
studied
;
however
,
few
show
a
relationship
to
herbicide
exposure
.
most
studies
address
such
a
wide
range
of
immune
parameters
that
it
is
likely
that
at
least
some
of
the
positive
results
are
due
to
chance
alone
,
which
undermines
the
credibility
of
those
studies
.
furthermore
,
the
clinical
meaning
,
ie
,
the
relationship
of
immune
disorders
to
disease
,
is
unclear

accordingly
,
the

has

however
,
these

had
a
number

:
they
were
not

did
not

variables
of

,

.
veteran
studies
(

)
have
suggested
that
any
increase
in
heart
disease
may
be
associated
with
the
vietnam
experience
rather
than
herbicide
exposure
,
and
most
of
these
studies
did
not
adjust
for

.
accordingly
,
the

has
found

the
credible
evidence
