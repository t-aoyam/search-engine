the
types
of
finishing
materials
include
stains
,
basecoats
,
washcoats
,
glazes
,
fillers
,
sealers
,
highlights
,
enamels
,
and
topcoats
that
all
serve
different
functions
.
the
number
,
sequence
,
and
type
of
finishing
materials
varies
by
the
type
and
quality
of
the
furniture
being
finished
.
all
of
the
finishing
materials
may
contain
hap
that
are
emitted
during
application
.
after
the
finishing
material
is
applied
,
the
wood
substrate
typically
enters
a
flashoff
area
where
the
more
volatile
solvents
evaporate
and
the
finishing
material
begins
to
cure
,
and
then
enters
an
oven
where
curing
of
the
finishing
material
and
evaporation
of
the
volatile
solvents
continues
.
the
evaporation
of
volatile
compounds
that
are
hap
are
the
source
of
hap
emissions
from
the
drying
operation
.
in
this
preamble
,
the
process
of
finishing
and
drying
a
piece
of
furniture
or
furniture
component
is
referred
to
as
the
finishing
operation
.
gluing
operations
occur
at
most
,
but
not
all
,
wood
furniture
facilities
.
gluing
operations
vary
from
plant
to
plant
and
include
the
manufacture
of
composite
pressed
wood
products
such
as
hardwood
plywood
,
and
applying
laminates
to
wood
products
,
veneers
to
solid
wood
(
or
composite
wood
products
,
edges
to
tables
or
desks
,
and
foam
to
fabric
.
four
major
types
of
adhesives
are
used
in
the
industry
:
hot
melts
,
polyvinyl
acetates
(
pva
,
ureaformaldehyde
urea
formaldehyde
(
uf
)
resins
,
and
contact
adhesives
.
hot
melts
are
not
a
source
of
hap
emissions
.
polyvinyl
acetate
adhesives
contain
very
small
amounts
(
less
than
03
percent
)
of
vinyl
acetate
monomer
(
a
hap
.
the
uf
resins
are
used
primarily
in
the
kitchen
cabinet
and
residential
furniture
segments
.
these
resins
are
a
source
of
formaldehyde
(
a
hap
)
emissions
,
both
from
the
free
formaldehyde
in
the
adhesive
and
as
a
reaction
byproduct
during
the
cure
.
formaldehyde
emissions
in
furniture
manufacturing
occur
during
the
use
of
these
resins
in
the
plant
and
also
during
storage
,
use
,
and
cutting
of
composite
pressed
wood
products
that
are
used
in
furniture
manufacturing
and
that
contain
these
resins
.
(
for
reasons
that
are
discussed
later
,
the
proposed
rule
does
not
address
formaldehyde
emissions
associated
with
formaldehydebased
formaldehyde
based
adhesive
resins
or
composite
wood
products
containing
these
resins
)
contact
adhesives
contain
varying
quantities
of
hap
as
solvent
.
these
adhesives
are
used
for
laminating
countertops
and
office
furniture
and
for
upholstery
operations
such
as
gluing
foam
to
fabric
and
fabric
to
wood
.
contact
adhesives
used
for
upholstery
operations
are
also
known
as
foam
adhesives
.
cleaning
activities
are
also
common
throughout
the
wood
furniture
industry
.
the
resins
typical
of
wood
furniture
coatings
require
a
highsolvencyrated
high
solvency
rated
solvent
to
dissolve
them
into
the
coating
mix
.
similarly
,
dried
coatings
that
must
be
removed
in
cleaning
operations
require
such
solvents
.
these
industrial
solvents
sometimes
contain
hap
that
evaporate
when
the
solvent
is
exposed
to
the
air
and
is
subsequently
discharged
to
the
atmosphere
via
ventilation
air
.
equipment
that
must
be
cleaned
within
a
wood
furniture
plant
is
typically
that
which
comes
in
close
contact
with
the
coating
material
;
eg
,
application
equipment
and
spray
booths
.
finished
furniture
that
does
not
meet
specification
may
need
to
be
refinished
;
the
cured
coating
is
removed
by
washing
off
the
old
coating
using
solvent
.
this
process
is
called
washoff
.
iii
.
summary
of
the
standards
the
proposed
standards
are
summarized
below
.
the
rationale
for
the
regulatory
decisions
made
in
their
development
is
provided
in
section
vi
.
a
.
applicability
of
the
standards
the
provisions
of
the
proposed
rule
apply
to
new
and
existing
wood
furniture
manufacturing
operations
that
are
located
at
plant
sites
that
are
major
sources
of
hap
.
a
major
source
is
defined
in
the
general
provisions
to
part
63
as
`
any
stationary
source
or
group
of
stationary
sources
located
within
a
contiguous
area
and
under
common
control
that
emits
or
has
the
potential
to
emit
,
considering
controls
,
in
the
aggregate
,
10
tons
yr
of
any
hazardous
air
pollutant
or
25
tons
yr
or
more
of
any
combination
of
hazardous
air
pollutants
.

'
as
noted
in
§
63
800
)
of
the
proposed
rule
,
the
proposed
wood
furniture
rule
would
apply
only
to
facilities
that
are
major
sources
as
defined
in
40
cfr
part
632
.
an
important
consideration
in
the
definition
of
`
major
source
'
is
a
given
plant
sites
`
potential
to
emit
'
the
`
potential
to
emit
'
is
defined
in
40
cfr
part
632
as
follows
:
`
potential
to
emit
'
means
the
maximum
capacity
of
a
stationary
source
to
emit
a
pollutant
under
its
physical
and
operational
design
.
any
physical
or
operational
limitation
on
the
capacity
of
the
stationary
source
to
emit
a
pollutant
,
including
air
pollution
control
equipment
and
restrictions
on
hours
of
operation
or
on
the
type
or
amount
of
material
combusted
,
stored
,
or
processed
,
shall
be
treated
as
part
of
its
design
if
the
limitation
or
the
effect
it
would
have
on
emissions
is
federally
enforceable
'
a
key
aspect
of
the
potential
to
emit
definition
is
that
restrictions
must
be
federally
enforceable
.
examples
of
restrictions
that
would
be
considered
federally
enforceable
are
listed
in
a
definition
in
40
cfr
632
.
the
epa
believes
that
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
wood
furniture
facilities
whose
actual
emissions
of
hap
are
substantially
less
than
`
major
'
amounts
(
ie
,
more
than
10
tons
per
year
of
any
single
hap
,
or
more
than
25
tons
per
year
from
the
sum
of
all
hap
emitted
.
many
of
these
facilities
,
however
,
would
be
considered
`
major
sources
'
that
are
subject
to
the
proposed
rule
because
there
is
no
federally
enforceable
restriction
in
place
that
limits
their
potential
to
emit
hap
.
the
epa
believes
that
the
wood
furniture
rule
should
provide
a
mechanism
for
such
facilities
to
accept
and
document
such
restrictions
.
