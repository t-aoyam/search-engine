this

are

,
directly
or
indirectly
,
with
a
represented
person
unless
the
contact
is
prohibited
by

section

plea
negotiations
this
section
prohibits
government
attorneys
from
initiating
or
engaging
in
negotiations
of
certain
specified
legal
agreements
with
any
individual
who
the
government
attorney
knows
is
represented
by
counsel
,
without
the
consent
of
that
individuals
counsel
.
even
when
substantive
discussions
with
a
represented
party
or
represented
person
are
permissible
under
these
regulations
,
it
ordinarily
would
be
improper
for
a
government
attorney
to
initiate
or
negotiate
a
plea
agreement
,
settlement
,
immunity
agreement
or
any
other
disposition
of
a
claim
or
charge
in
the
absence
of
the
individuals
counsel
.
the
one
exception
to
this
prohibition
occurs
when
the
communication
is
initiated
by
the
represented
person
or
represented
party
and
the
procedural
safeguards
provided
for
in
§
776c
)
are
satisfied
.
the
department
believes
that
this
section
is
vitally
important
for
the
preservation
of
the
attorneyclient
attorney
client
relationship
.
one
of
the
primary
purposes
informing
rule
42
and
dr
7104
is
that
an
individual
represented
by
counsel
should
be
protected
from
overreaching
by
an
attorney
for
an
adversary
.
the
department
believes
the
risk
of
such
overreaching
is
greatest
during
negotiations
over
plea
agreements
,
settlements
and
other
key
legal
agreements
.
the
training
,
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
law
possessed
by
an
attorney
is
particularly
valuable
in
such
situations
.
the
prohibition
contained
in
this
section
includes
all
discussions
of
the
terms
of
a
particular
plea
agreement
,
settlement
agreement
or
other
agreement
covered
by
the
section
.
however
,
this
section
does
not
prohibit
an
attorney
for
the
government
from
responding
to
questions
regarding
the
nature
of
such
agreements
,
potential
charges
,
potential
penalties
or
other
subjects
related
to
such
agreements
during
an
otherwise
permissible
discussion
.
nevertheless
,
an
attorney
for
the
government
should
take
care
in
such
situations
not
to
go
beyond
providing
information
on
these
and
similar
subjects
and
should
generally
refer
the
represented
person
to
his
or
her
counsel
for
further
discussion
of
these
issues
.
the
government
attorney
should
also
make
it
clear
that
he
or
she
will
not
negotiate
any
agreement
with
respect
to
the
disposition
of
criminal
charges
,
civil
claims
or
potential
charges
or
claims
or
immunity

the
presence
or
consent
of

when

or

of
the
exceptions
listed
in
§

,
or
with

right
,
if
he

she
so
chooses
,
to
communicate
with

the
rules
do
not

to

the

may
elect
to
speak
directly
with
the

despite

advice
not
to
do
so
.
as
a
further
protective
measure
,
federal
courts
have
recognized
that
it
is
improper
for
an
attorney
for
the
government
to
disparage
counsel
for
the
represented
party
or
otherwise
to
seek
to
disrupt
the
relationship
between
that
party
and

this
paragraph
codifies
those
basic
principles
by
prohibiting
communications
that
:
(

)
attempt
to
elicit
information
regarding
lawful
defense
strategies
;
(
2
)
disparage
the
represented
partys
counsel
;
or
(

otherwise
disrupt
the
attorneyclient
attorney

.
these
prohibitions
apply
in
every
phase
of
criminal
and
civil
enforcement
investigations
and
proceedings
.
however
,
the
paragraph
also
accommodates
an
important
exception
to
this
prohibition
.
courts
have
held
that
a
government
attorney
may
not
permit
legal
proceedings
to
go
forward
if
he
or
she
is
aware
of
a
conflict
of
interest
between
a
represented
party
and
his
or
her
lawyer
.

(

.
under
these
circumstances
,
the
attorney
for
the
government
ordinarily
should
move
to
disqualify
the
lawyer
involved
,
if
legal
proceedings
have
already
commenced
.
if
it
is
not
feasible
to
move
for
disqualification
or
otherwise
challenge
the
representation
,
this
paragraph
allows
an
attorney
for
the
government
to
communicate
with
the
represented
individual
for
the
limited
purpose
of
apprising
the
represented
individual
of
the
perceived
conflict
.
however
,
any
substantive
discussion
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
representation
is
permissible
only
insofar
as
it
is
authorized
by
some
other
provision
of
this
rule
.
in
order
to
ensure
that
this
provision
is
used
only
in
rare
circumstances
,
the
rule
would
require
prior
authorization
for
such
communications
from
the
attorney
general
,
the
deputy
attorney
general
,
the
associate
attorney
general
,
an
assistant
attorney
general
or
a
united
states
attorney
.
the
authorization
should
be
in
writing
if
at
all
possible
.
furthermore
,
before
providing
approval
,
the
authorizing
officer
must
find
:
(
1
)
a
substantial
likelihood
of
a
conflict
;
and
(
2
)
that
it
is
not
feasible
to
obtain
a
court
order
on
the
matter
.

the
attendance
of
an
undercover
agent
or
a
cooperating
witness
at
lawful
meetings
of
an
individual
and
his
or
her
attorneys
is
ordinarily
an
improper
intrusion
into
the
attorneyclient
attorney
client
relationship
.
the
courts
have
recognized
,
however
,
that
such
attendance
occasionally
will
be
required
when
the
operative
is
invited
to
participate
and
his
or

refusal
to
do
so
would
