defined
the

`
overall

'
in

for

rule
(

.
according
to
the
statement
of
considerations
,
`
the
phrase
`
overall
treatment
period
'
was
added
to
emphasize
that
the
treatments
will
end
after
the
specified
number
of
weeks
,
unless
the
treatment
period
is
revised
by
the
authorized
user
prior
to
continuing
'
therefore
,
the
treatment
period
is
a
unit
of
time
and
not
the
number
of
fractions
as
used
in
the
licensees
definition
.
the
licensee
argues
that
three
different
individuals
(
the
authorized
user
and
two
radiation
therapists
)
attempted
to
verify
that
the
treatment
to
be
delivered
was
in
accordance
with
the
written
directive
,
and
that
the
failure
to
identify
the
error
was
related
to
the
working
of
the
written
directive
rather
than
a
failure
to
follow
proper
procedure
.
however
,
the
same
authorized
user
had
created
the
written
directive
that
same
afternoon
.
therefore
,
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
his
failure
to
identify
the
error
was
related
to
the
wording
of
his
own
written
directive
.
the
licensees
qmp
procedure
required
that
the
authorized
user
review
and
initial
the
treatment
chart
to
verify
that
he
had
reviewed
the
written
prescription
and
the
calculated
dose
per
fraction
.
as
noted
in
the
inspection
report
,
the
information
written
on
the
patient
chart
clearly
indicated
that
the
dose
per
fraction
was
incorrect
.
it
appears
that
the
authorized
user
initialed
the
chart
and
that
his
review
was
cursory
or
inadequate
.
moreover
,
the
violation
focuses
on
the
fact
that
,
while
the
licensees
qmp
requires
that
a
physics
staff
member
review
the
accuracy
of
all
dosimetric
calculations
for
treatments
that
are
delivered
in
four
or
more
fractions
,
it
has
no
equivalent
provision
for
treatments
that
are
delivered
in
less
than
four
fractions
.
had
such
an
independent
review
been
required
by
the
licensees
qmp
and
performed
in
this
case
,
the
error
could
have
been
avoided
.
the
licensees
qmp
waived
review
of
dose
calculations
by
the
physics
staff
member
for
extenuating
circumstances
such
as
staff
shortages
and
emergency
treatments
.
neither
the
qmp
regulations
nor
the
accompanying
regulatory
guide
suggest
that
this
independent
review
may
be
waived
for
staff
shortages
or
emergent
treatments
,
such
as
those
that
must
be
performed
after
working
hours
.

the
independent

is
especially
important
during

is
more
subject
to
error
such
as
with

based
on
the
above
,
the
nrc
concludes
that
the

did
occur
as

that
there

adequate
basis
for
a
reduction

identification
the
licensee
asserts
that
the
nrc
improperly
takes
credit
for
identifying
the
proposed
violation
of
the
qmp
because
the
qmp
was
submitted
to
the
nrc
approximately
15
years
ago
in
accordance
with
10
cfr

;
and
,
since
that
submission
,
the
licensee
has
received
no
indication
that
the
qmp
was
deficient
.
according
to
the
licensee
,
the
`
less
than
four
treatment
'
deficiency
was
detected
concurrently
by
the
nrc
and
the
licensee
as
a
result
of
this
misadministration
;
and
therefore
,
escalation
of
enforcement
based
on
the
nrcs
claim
of
identifying
the
deficiency
is
inappropriate
.

licensee
performance
the
licensee
asserts
that
the
nrc
improperly
escalated
the
base
civil
penalty
by
100
percent
for
`
poor
past
performance
'
and
notes
that
this
was
apparently
due
to
a
misadministration
which
occurred
in
may
of
1990
,
some
25
years
before
the
most
recent
one
.
according
to
the
licensee
,
while
the
nrc
claims
that
these
two
misadministrations
were
`
similar
,
the
only
similarities
were
that
they
were
both
brain
treatments
and
the
dose
per
fraction
was
doubled
.
the
licensee
notes
that
the
dissimilarities
include
an
emergency
treatment
versus
treatment
during
normal
working
hours
,
a
shortterm
short
term
versus
a
more
conventional
longterm
long
term
treatment
,
and
a
single
port
treatment
versus
a
multiple
port
treatment
.
according
to
the
licensee
,
there
appears
to
be
no
relationship
between
the
causes
of
the
two
misadministrations
.
the
licensee
indicates
that
this
escalation
implies
that
the
nrcs
sole
evaluation
of
past
performance
relates
to
the
number
of
misadministrations
which
have
occurred
and
been
reported
over
an
undefined
period
of
time
.
the
licensee
points
out
that
the
05/19/1990
misadministration
was
discovered
through
its
qa
qcp
and
,
until
january
of
1992
,
most
licensees
were
not
required
to
have
any
type
of
qmp
;
therefore
,
comparing
the
licensees
performance
to
that
of
other
licensees
in
not
appropriate
(
ie
,
other
licensees
may
have
had
misadministrations
which
went
undetected
due
to
the
fact
that
they
had
no
qmp
.
the
licensee
asserts
that
while
a
qmp
helps
reduce
the
possibility
of
misadministrations
,
normal
statistical
probabilities
would
predict
that
the
potential
for
misadministrations
will
increase
with
the
number
of
patient
treatments
due
to
human
error
.
in
the
licensees
particular
instance
,
its
radiation
oncology
department
treated
approximately
1418
patients
including
some
52000
separate
treatments
with
external
beam
therapy
during
the
time
interval
between
the
two
misadministrations
.
five
hundred
and
eighteen
(
518
)
of
those
patients
(
approximately
15000
separate
treatments
)
were
specifically
treated
with
cobalt60
cobalt
teletherapy
.
according
to
the
licensee
,
one
patient
with
two
ports
in
error
is
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
overall
number
of
treatments
and
should
not
be
sufficient
to
escalate

penalty
