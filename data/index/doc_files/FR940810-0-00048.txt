,
osha
proposed
a
new
standard
for
indoor
air
quality
.
the
proposed
regulation
included
a
clause
making
brief
reference
to
asbestos
.
see
paragraph
(
d8
)
at
page
16036

that
reference
was
unintended

osha

intends
to
cover
all
asbestos
issues
in
the
final
asbestos
rule
where
full
consideration
has
been
given
to
them

osha
will
not
create
new
requirements
in
a

standard
that
are
specifically
designed
to
control
asbestos
exposures
,
and
will
announce
that
it
is
withdrawing
the
asbestos
clause
in
paragraph
(

at
the
commencement
of
the

summary

these
final
standards
constitute
oshas
response
to
the
remaining
issues
raised
for
the
agencys
reconsideration
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
dc

circuit
.
the
specific
issues
raised
by
the
court
are
:
the
establishment
of
operationspecific
operation
specific
permissible
exposure
limits
;
the
extension
of
reporting
and
information
transfer
requirements
;
the
expansion
of
the

requirement
to
all
employers
engaged
in
any
kind
of
construction
work
;
and
,
the
clarification
of
the
small
scale
,
short
duration
operation
exemption
from
the
requirement

negative
pressure
enclosure
.
for
convenience
osha
is
summarizing
here
its
response
to
each
of
these
issues
.
they
are
discussed
in
depth
below
.
also
discussed
below

the
other
changes
osha
has
made
which

issue

.
establishment
of
operation
specific
exposure
limits
:
the
court
remand
causes
osha
to
consider
establishing
operationspecific
operation
specific
permissible
exposure
limits
to
the
extent
feasible
,
as
needed
to
eliminate
significant
risk
of
illnesses
caused
by
asbestos
exposure
.
osha
proposed
to
decrease
the
pel
to
a
uniform
01
f
cc
.
osha
believes
that
this
limit
is
feasible
for
most
industry
sectors
to
reach
most
of
the
time
(
55
fr
29720
.
however
,
osha
explained
that
pels
lower
than
01
f
cc
are
difficult
to
reliably
measure
.
however
osha
has
followed
a
more
effective
approach
to
lowering
exposures
for
those
sections
and
operations
where
lower
exposures
can
be
achieved
.
this
approach
is
triggering
protective
provisions
based
on
the
kind
of
operation
undertaken
,
rather
than
measured
exposure
levels
.
this
approach
is
consistent
with
some
other
health
standards
(
eg
,
lead
,
coke
ovens
.
