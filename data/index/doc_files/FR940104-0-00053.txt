only
those
wastes
from
wood
surface
protection
processes
using
a
formulation
with
a
pentachlorophenate
concentration
greater
than
01
ppm
.
under
this
proposed
option
,
surface
protection
operations
using
formulations
with
pentachlorophenate
concentrations
equal
to
or
less
than
01
ppm
would
not
generate
f033
listed
wastes
.
the
agency
proposed
this
concentrationbased
concentration
based
listing
because
it
had
information
which
suggested
that
many
surface
protectors
who
previously
used
chlorophenolics
did
not
sufficiently
clean
out
equipment
prior
to
abandoning
the
use
of
chlorophenolics
.
because
of
this
,
many
formulations
from
past
users
of
chlorophenolics
exhibit
`
crosscontamination
cross
contamination
'
the
contamination
of
current
formulations
by
dioxins
and
chlorophenolic
compounds
from
old
formulations
.
the
rule
proposed
the
following
hazardous
waste
listing
description
for
the
f033
waste
code
and
included
the
following
specific
waste
streams
from
process
operations
:
f033process
residuals
,
wastewaters
that
come
into
contact
with
protectant
,
discarded
spent

,
and
protectant
drippage
from
wood
surface
protection
processes
at
plants
that
use
surface

chemicals
having
an
