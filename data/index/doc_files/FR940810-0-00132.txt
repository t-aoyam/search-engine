)
all

be
performed
using
wet

;
(

that

results
in

of

applied

(
they
found
5

and
their

should
be
discontinued

continue
to

)
recommends
discontinuance
of
use
of
power
equipment
to
strip
wax
from

unless
they
do
not
contain

and

(

alter

to

both

discussed
in
the

which
was
conducted
in

and
which

standard

mopped

standard
black

pad
,
and
(

)
mist
spray
of

solution
and
standard
black
stripping
pad
.
as
noted
in
the
proposal
,
the
stripping
conducted
using
a
mist
spray
of
stripping
solution
and
the
more
abrasive
pad
resulted
in
significantly
higher
asbestos

concentrations
than
the
first
method

on

in

to

outlining
its
analysis
of
the

findings

the
agency
concluded
that
,
although
there
was
`
no
clear
evidence
'
that
`
routine
'
stripping
significantly
elevated
levels
of
asbestos
fibers
,
it
observed
that
higher
levels
did
occur
after
a
stripping
machine
was
used
on
a
relatively
dry
,
unwaxed
floor
.
work
practices
recommended
by
epa
in
the
same
guidance
memo
emphasize
the
same
precautions
contained
in
oshas
final
standards
:
viz
.
that
the
least
abrasive
pad
be
used
for
stripping
,
and
that
low
speed
equipment
be
used
for
stripping
of
floors
.
osha
notes
that
accshs
recommendations
for
work
practices
in
floor
maintenance
also
echo
the
themes
of
wet
stripping
,
using
the
least
abrasive
pad
for
stripping
,
limiting
the
speed
of
the
machine
and
prohibiting
floor
sanding
,
which
are
the
core
requirements
in
this
standard
.
(
ex

.
in
a
change
from
the
proposal
,
osha
is
permitting
high
speed
buffing
of
finished
floors
containing
asbestos
material
.
a
number
of
participants
pointed
out
to
osha
that
buffing
,
although
performed
at
high
speed
,
is
done
on
3
to
5
layers
of
wax
,
unlike
sanding
,
and
that
the
wax

not
the

,
is
polished

he
went
on
to

he
cited

that
if
there

,
these

do
not

because
they
do

they
oppose
oshas
proposed
changes
prohibiting
speeds
of
more
than

particularly
due
