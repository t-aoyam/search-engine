scope
and
application
:
paragraph
(
a
)
osha
is
proposing
that
these
standards
cover
all
employees
under
its
jurisdiction
,
including
employees
in
general
industry
,
shipyards
,
longshoring
,
marine
terminals
,
construction
,
and
agriculture
.
to
accomplish
this
,
osha
is
proposing
to
publish
an
identical
complete
standard
for
general
industry
at
29
cfr
1910
1033
,
for
shipyards
at
29
cfr
1915
1033
,
and
for
construction
at
29
cfr
1926
1133
.
osha
is
proposing
to
amend
section
1910
19
to
make
it
clear
that
§
1910
1033
is
a
subpart
z
standard
which
is
incorporated
by
cross
reference
into
29
cfr
parts
1917
and
1018
for
longshoring
and
marine
terminals
.
osha
is
proposing
to
amend
29
cfr
1928
21
to
indicate
that
1910
1033
will
be
applicable
to
agriculture
.
osha
requests
comments
on
the
scope
of
the
proposal
and
the
formal
manner
by
which
the
standard
would
be
incorporated
into
the
code
of
federal
regulations
.
paragraph
(
a1
)
proposes
to
apply
all
provisions
of
the
standard
to
`
nonindustrial
work
environments
'
in
addition
,
paragraph
(
a2
)
proposes
to
further
extend
coverage
of
the
provisions
found
in
paragraph
(
e1
,
which
address
exposure
to
tobacco
smoke
,
to
all
indoor
work
environments
under
oshas
jurisdiction
.
this
includes
indoor
work
areas
on
construction
sites
,
shipyards
,
and
agricultural
employments
.
the
agency
believes
that
application
of
the
proposed
provisions
under
paragraph
(
e1
)
addressing
exposure
to
tobacco
smoke
is
necessary
,
appropriate
,
and
feasible
for
any
indoor
or
enclosed
workplace
covered
by
osha
.
compliance
with
the
tobacco
smoke
provisions
essentially
entails
establishment
of
a
separate
enclosure
,
exhausted
directly
to
the
outside
,
and
maintained
under
negative
pressure
where
smoking
is
permitted
.
osha
sees
no
feasibility
obstacles
in
application
of
these
provisions
to
industrial
as
well
as
nonindustrial
work
environments
.
it
is
not
clear
to
osha
,
however
,
that
the
other
indoor
air
quality
provisions
of
the
proposed
standard
can
be
feasibly
or
appropriately
applied
in
typical
industrial
work
environments
.
these
provisions
primarily
address
means
to
assure
effective
functioning
of
hvac
systems
and
actions
felt
necessary
to
be
taken
to
maintain
good
general
indoor
air
quality
.
thus
,
it
may
not
be
feasible
or
appropriate
to
apply
these
provisions
to
industrial
ventilation
systems
or
industrial
environments
in
which
control
of
various
industrial
contaminant
emissions
rather
than
general
air
quality
is
the
primary
issue
.
definitions
:
paragraph
(
b
)
the
following
terms
are
defined
for
the
purpose
of
this
proposal
:
`
air
contaminants
,
`
assistant
secretary
,
`
building
systems
,
`
buildingrelated
building
related

,
`
designated

,
`

,
`

,
`
employer
,
`
hvac
system
,
`
nonindustrial
non
industrial
work
environment
,
and
`
renovation
and
remodeling
.
the
term
`
air
contaminants
'
refers
to
substances
contained
in
the
vapors
from
paint
,
cleaning
chemicals
,
pesticides
,
solvents
,
particulates
,
outdoor
air
pollutants
and
other
airborne
substances
which
may
cause
material
impairment
to
the
health
of
employees
working
within
the
nonindustrial
environment
.
the
term
`
air
contaminants
'
informs
the
employer
that
the
provisions
addressing
control
of
air
contaminants
apply
to
airborne
substances
which
may
be
within
nonindustrial
indoor
work
environments
.
for
purposes
of
this
proposal
the
definition
of
air
contaminants
may
be
broader
than
that
used
in
29
cfr
1910
1000
.
hazardous
levels
of
air
contaminants
may
arise
from
contaminant
buildup
due
to
inefficient
or
insufficient
general
dilution
ventilation
with
outside
air
,
the
misapplication
of
general
dilution
ventilation
to
address
strong
point
sources
,
indoor
activities
or
operations
such
as
renovation
,
remodeling
,
maintenance
,
etc
.
which
lead
to
local
source
emissions
,
and
entry
of
outdoor
contaminants
such
as
vehicle
exhausts
,
wastes
,
stored
materials
,
or
pollutants
from
adjacent
industrial
facilities
.
provisions
are
proposed
in
the
standard
which
require
the
employer
to
take
measures
to
address
the
avenues
of
contaminant
buildup
noted
above
.
the
term
`
assistant
secretary
'
means
the
assistant
secretary
of
labor
for
occupational
safety
and
health
,
us
.
department
of
labor
,
or
designee
.
the
term
`
building
systems
'
applies
to
the
heating
,
ventilation
and
airconditioning
air
conditioning
(
hvac
)
system
,
the
potable
water
system
,
the
energy
management
system
,
and
all
other
systems
in
a
facility
which
may
impact
indoor
air
quality
.
this
broad
definition
was
necessary
to
avoid
excluding
nonhvac
hvac
systems
which
do
impact
indoor
air
quality
.
in
the
facilities
industry
,
potable
hot
water
systems
are
typically
considered
plumbing
systems
and
not
hvac
systems
.
plumbing
systems
(
potable
hot
water
)
have
been
implicated
in
legionella
episodes
where
the
water
is
aerosolized
,
so
excluding
plumbing
systems
from
the
scope
of
this
standard
would
have
been
unacceptable
.
this
definition
also
intends
to
focus
operation
and
maintenance
efforts
on
those
systems
whose
failure
,
degradation
,
or
misuse
would
adversely
impact
indoor
air
quality
.
the
term
`
buildingrelated
building
related
illness
'
describes
specific
medical
conditions
of
known
etiology
which
can
be
documented
by
physical
signs
and
laboratory
findings
.
such
illnesses
include
sensory
irritations
when
caused
by
known
agents
,
respiratory
allergies
,
nosocomial
infections
,
asthma
,
humidifier
fever
,
hypersensitivity
pneumonitis
,
legionnaires
'
disease
,
and
the
symptoms
and
signs
characteristic
of
exposure
to
chemical
or
biologic
substances
such
as
carbon
monoxide
,
formaldehyde
,
chlordane
,
endotoxins
,
or
mycotoxins
.
`
buildingrelated
building
related
illness
'
defines
the
medical
conditions
that
,
if
observed
,
require
evaluation
of
the
facility
building
systems
to
determine
if
they
are
functioning
properly
,
and
the
taking
of
remedial
action
where
warranted
.
buildingrelated
building
related
illnesses
are
often
potentially
severe
and
are
often
traceable
to
a
specific
contaminant
source
such
as
ets
,
microbial
growth
,
and
a
host
of
other
chemical
or
biologic
substances
which
must
be
attended
to
mitigate
degradation
of
indoor
air
quality
.
the
term
`
designated
person
'
means
a
person
who
has
been
given
the
responsibility
by
the
employer
to
take
necessary
measures
to
assure
compliance
with
this
section
and
who
is
knowledgeable
in
the
requirements
of
this
standard
and
the
specific
hvac
system
servicing
the
affected
building
or
office
.
as
noted
above
a
`
designated
person
'
must
be
knowledgeable
in
hvac
system
functioning
.
provisions
in
the
standard
propose
to
require
the
`
designated
person
'
to
oversee
the
establishment
and
implementation
of
the
iaq
compliance
program
,
and
oversee
building
systems
inspection
and
maintenance
activities
,
thus
this
person
must
have
technical
expertise
in
those
areas
.
osha
believes
that
there
is
a
need
for
central
responsibility
in
affected
buildings
and
facilities
[
exs
.
3434
,
3444b
,
3507
.
of
course
osha
recognizes
that
in
certain
circumstances
the
`
designated
person
'
may
merely
supervise
or
coordinate
the
activities
of
outside
contractors
or
shiftworkers
shift
workers
who
have
responsibility
for
maintaining
parts
of
the
building
systems
.
building
systems
and
other
factors
affecting
indoor
air
quality
are
sufficiently
complex
and
unique
to
suggest
the
necessity
of
appointing
a
designated
person
who
is
on
site
to
act
on
the
employers
behalf
in
this
regard
.
for
example
,
multiple
employers
may
be
engaging
in
different
activities
within
a
facility
that
affect
building
system
functioning
or
air
quality
and
actions
by
one
employer
may
subject
employees
of
other
employers
to
environmental
hazards
.
fragmentation
of
responsibility
and
lack
of
communication
has
been
observed
by
osha
in
the
nonindustrial
workplace
.
for
example
,
when
responding
to
an
indoor
air
quality/buildingrelated
quality/building
related
illness
complaint
,
the
osha
compliance
officer
may
need
to
gather
information
from
a
number
of
responsible
facility
groups
like
tenant
leasing
,
facilities
engineering
,
housekeeping
,
maintenance
,
operations
,
and
energy
management
.
these
diverse
groups
may
have
little
or
no
central
authority
and
direction
especially
if
they
are
outside
contractors
.
the
designated
person
would
be
in
a
position
to
mitigate
the
consequences
of
such
diversity
by
being
aware
and
responsible
for
the
overall
environmental
conditions
in
the
building
or
facility
.
