instituted

that

organizations

consists
of

but
the

department
of

will
ultimately
have
the
rights
to

approval

is
automatically
approved
after

if

a

of

will
be
enforced
on

that

provides

are

enforcement
procedures
states
and
local
jurisdictions
must
include
enforcement
provisions
in
their
etr
regulations
such
as

and
or

for
an
employer
who
fails
to
submit
a

plan
or
an
employer
who
fails
to
meet
the

targets
.
penalties
should
be
severe
enough
to
provide
an
adequate
incentive
for
employers
to
comply
and
be
no
less
than
the
expected
cost
of
compliance
.
a
state
may
meet
this
requirement
by
developing
a
procedure
for
tracking
and
fining
noncomplying
complying
employers
.
new

penalties
for

are
as

:

of

the

however

good

are
limited

indicates
that

are
to

indicated
that
it
interprets

shifting
commuters
out
of
the
peak
period
new
jersey
rule
allows
for
shifting
commuters
out
of
the
peak
period
while
continuing
to
count
the
commuters
(
people
but
not
their
vehicles
)
as
if
they
arrived
during
the
600
am
.
to
1000
am
.
peak
period
,
which
is
the
most
critical
time
for
emissions
which
lead
to
ground
level
ozone
formation
.
this
raises
the
vehicle
occupancy
rate
because
the
number
of
employees
remains
stable
while
the
number
of
vehicles
arriving
at
the
workplace
is
decreased
by
the
number
which
arrive
outside
of
the
peak
period
.
epas
policy
has
been
to
require
employers
to
calculate
their
vehicle
occupancy
rate
by
reducing
both
the
number
of
employees
and
the
number
of
vehicles
so
that
only
those
arriving
during
the
peak
period
are
included
in
the
calculation
.
epa
believes
that
most
employers
will
not
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
this
to
any
significant
degree
because
most
will
not
be
able
to
have
employees
start
outside
of
the
peak
period
.
for
those
that
do
take
advantage
of
this
provision
,
the
trips
will
have
at
least
been
shifted
out
of
the
most
congested
periods
of
the
day
and
the
emissions
from
these
trips
will
have
been
shifted
out
of
the
key
600
am
.
to
900
am
.
period
.
therefore
,
epa
proposes
to
accept
this
approach
by
new
jersey
.

trading
credits
between
nonattainment
areas
new
jerseys
rule
allows
trading
of
credits
between
employers
in
the
two
different
severe
nonattainment
areas
in
the
state
.
however
,
epas
eco
guidance
only
allows
for
trades
within
the
same
nonattainment
area
.
epas
guidance
is
based
on
eco
applying
specifically
to
discrete
nonattainment
areas
;
therefore
,
the
trading
of
apo
credits
across
nonattainment
area
boundaries
should
not
be
accepted
based
on
an
interpretation
that
the
term
,
`

'
in
section
182d1b
)
should
only
be
construed
to
mean
`
nonattainment
