according
to
the
comment
,
such

remove
too
much
of
the
energy
at
the
short
end
of
the

and
result
in
overestimating
the

of

xenon

contain

one
comment
submitted
a
method
that
assesses
the
attenuation
of
the
incident
solar
radiation
on
human
skin
by
a
sunscreen
(
ref
.
27
.
this
method
utilizes
the
principles
of
diffuse
reflectance
and
fluorescence
excitation
spectroscopy
.
the
method
directly
measures
the
optical
properties
of
the
skin
decoupled
from
its
biological
responses
.
both
procedures
are
based
on
the
same
principle
,
any
modification
of
the
surface
of
the
skin
will
produce
changes
in
its
absorption
properties
.
application
of
a
sunscreen
modifies
the
surface
of
the
skin
by
providing
an
additional
barrier
through
which
solar
radiation
must
penetrate
before
reaching
the
skin
.
measurement
of
the
absorption
properties
of
the
skin
before
and
after
sunscreen
application
yields
the
transmission

of
the
product
and
permits

solar

value
for
the
wavelength
range
investigated
.
the
comment
stated
that
,
because
this
method
allows
repetitive
testing
,
evaluations
of
substantivity
and
water
resistance
are
possible
.
the
comment
contended
that
,
because
the
testing
is
done
on
human
skin
,
questions
of
binding
,
distribution
,
and
photodegradation
can
be
answered
.
in
addition
,
the
comment
maintained
that
this
testing
procedure
,
like
the
diffey
and
robson
method
(
ref
.
12
,
does
not
suffer
from
a
lack
of
dose
reciprocity
,
as
observed
with
uvainduced
uva
induced
acute
skin
reactions
.
the
comment
concluded
that
this
procedure
allows
for
the
correct
estimation
of
the
attenuating
power
of
a
sunscreen
;
thus
,
the
protection
potential
of
products
in
sunlight
will
be
correctly
estimated
.
the
agency
would
like
to
discuss
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
various
recommended
testing
procedures
and
the
following
specific
questions
regarding
these
test
methods
at
the
meeting
:
1
.
which
of
the
in
vitro
test
methods
described
above
would
be
adequate
to
evaluate
the
uva
protection
provided
by
a
sunscreen
drug
product
?
why
would
the
others
not
be
appropriate
?
2
.
are
the
results
of
in
vitro
uva
testing
methods
relevant
to
the
uva
protection
provided
to
consumers
by
a
sunscreen
drug
product
during
normal
use
?
3
.
does
the
app
test
method
demonstrate
whether
a
sunscreen
drug
product
provides
meaningful
protection
against
harmful
uva
radiation
?
4
.
do
the
data
show
that
the
app
test
does
not
overestimate
the
actual
amount
of
uva
radiation
blocked
by
most
sunscreen
drug
products
?
identify
the
data
.
5
.
describe
the
specifications
for
an
appropriate
light
source
for
the
ipd
testing
method
,
eg
,
spectral
distribution
,
intensity
,
etc
.
