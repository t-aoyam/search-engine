summary
:
these
final
regulations
implement
amendments
to
section
721
of
title
vii
of
the
defense
production
act
of
1950
(
the
`
dpa
,
as
added
by
section
5021
of
the
omnibus
trade
and
competitiveness
act
of
1988
,
relating
to
mergers
,
acquisitions
,
and
takeovers
of
us
.
persons
by
or
with
foreign
persons
,
and
as
amended
by
section
837
of
the
national
defense
authorization
act
for
fiscal
year
1993
.
that
amendment
requires
that
the
president
or
his
designee
undertake
an
investigation
under
section
721
of
certain
acquisitions
which
could
result
in
control
of
us
.
persons
by
foreign
government
controlled
entities
.
it
also
expands
the
factors
the
president
must
consider
in
making
a
determination
under
section
721
,
modifies
the
existing
congressional
reporting
requirement
under
section
721
,
and
requires
that
any
designee
of
the
president
under
section
721
share
with
any
other
designee
a
copy
of
an
assessment
made
in
a
particular
case
of
the
risk
of
diversion
of
a
defense
critical
technology
.
these
final
regulations
implement
only
those
provisions
relating
to
mandatory
investigations
,
and
also
make
a
few
technical
and
conforming
changes
to
the
existing
regulations
.
the
statutory
amendments
pertaining
to
the
factors
for
presidential
decisionmaking
and
report
sharing
,
which
do
not
directly
affect
the
behavior
of
parties
filing
under
section
721
,
were
deemed
sufficiently
straightforward
not
to
require
any
implementing
regulations

section
136
of
the
defense
production
act
amendments
of
1992
(
pub
.
l
.

)
amended
section
709
of
the
dpa
by
requiring
that
any
regulation
issued
under
the
dpa
be
published
in
the
federal
register
and
that
opportunity
for
public
comment
be
provided
for
not
less
than
thirty
days
.
although
the
treasury
department
elected
to
provide
a
sixty
day
comment
period
for
the
regulations
originally
proposed
to
implement
section
721
,
it
provided
thirty
days
for
public
comment
on
these
regulations
,
in
light
of
their
relatively
routine
nature
.
the
proposed
regulations
were
published
on
02/16/1994
;
just
one
written
comment
was
received
during
the
thirtyday
thirty
day
comment
period
.
the
preamble
to
the
final
regulations
has
been
clarified
to
reflect
this
comment
,
and
a
few
minor
changes
have
been
made
to
the
regulations
themselves
in
response
to
suggestions
from
staff
members
of
the
committee
on
foreign
investment
in
the
united
states
.
the
preamble
to
these
regulations
will
be
preserved
with
the
preamble
to
the
original
regulations
as
an
appendix
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations
.
