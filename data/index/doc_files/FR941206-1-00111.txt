these

from

to
further
illustrate
the
vohap

calculations
,
the
following
example
is
provided
:
a
shipyard
wants
to
use
(
demonstrate
compliance
using
option

)
a
general
use
coating
with
a
voc
content
of
392
g
l
less
water
and
exempt
solvents
,
a
measured
vohap
content
of
288
g
l
less
water
,
and
an
average
solvent
density
of
880
g
l
.
since
the
vohap
limit
for
general
use
coatings
is
340
g
l
less
water
,
the
vohap
alt
limits
were
calculated
to
be
571
g
vohap
l
solids
(
see
table
1
.
<
import

egraphicsep06de94

<
import
>
compliance
for
the
coating
is
therefore
demonstrated
because
the
vohap
content
of
519
g
l
solids
is
less
than
the
vohap
alt
limit
of
571
g
l
