background
this
proposed
dfars
rule
supplements
a
proposed
far
rule
concerning
the
allowability
of
personal
services
compensation
costs
which
was
published
in
the
federal
register
for
public
comment
on
10/11/1994
(

fr

.
the
proposed
dfars
rule
would
limit
the
far
compensation
system
review
procedures
to
dod
prime
contractors
or
subcontractors
which
have
received
awards
totaling
$
50
million
or
more
in
the
previous
fiscal
year
and
for
which
cost
or
pricing
data
was
submitted
.

regulatory
flexibility
act
the
proposed
rule
is
not
expected
to
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial

of
small
entities
within
the
meaning
of
the
regulatory
flexibility
act

,
because
most
contracts
awarded
to
small
entities
are
awarded
on
a
competitive

fixedprice
fixed
price
basis
and
the

principles
do
not
apply

an

therefore
