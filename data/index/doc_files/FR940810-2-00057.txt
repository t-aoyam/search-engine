supplementary
information
:
i
.
introduction
under
the
federal
insecticide
,
fungicide
,
and
rodenticide
act
(
fifra
,
epa
is
given
the
responsibility
of
regulating
the
manufacture
,
sale
,
and
use
of
pesticides
to
ensure
that
there
are
no
unreasonable
adverse
effects
to
human
health
or
the
environment
as
a
result
of
the
use
of
a
pesticide
.
regulatory
decisions
that
carry
out
this
responsibility
are
reached
by
evaluating
the
risks
and
benefits
associated
with
the
pesticides
use
,
as
well
as
with
alternative
pesticides
and
pest
control
methods
.
this
process
determines
what
degree
of
risk
is
reasonable
while
taking
into
consideration
the
economic
and
social
benefits
gained
from
the
pesticide
,
ensuring
that
the
risks
do
not
outweigh
the
benefits
.
the
agency
has
several
mechanisms
in
place
to
effect
this
balance
if
the
results
of
the
risk
and
benefit
evaluations
indicate
that
unreasonable
adverse
effects
are
likely
from
the
pesticides
use
and
that
regulatory
action
is
warranted
.
each
of
these
mechanisms
has
advantages
and
disadvantages
that
range
from
the
length
of
time
required
to
reach
the
regulatory
decision
,
the
amount
of
agency
resources
necessary
,
to
the
degree
the
public
is
involved
.
ii
.
background
when
the
agency
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
use
of
a
currently
registered
pesticide
may
result
in
unreasonable
adverse
effects
to
human
health
or
the
environment
,
a
structured
review
of
the
pesticide
of
concern
may
be
carried
out
through
the
formal
special
review
process
.
the
risk
criteria
initiating
this
review
process
and
the
regulations
governing
it
are
set
forth
in
40
cfr
part
154
.
the
formal
special
review
process
as
set
forth
in
these
regulations
provides
the
opportunity
for
public
input
through
the
solicitation
of
comments
at
two
distinct
stages
of
the
review
:
the
formal
announcement
of
initiation
of
the
special
review
(
position
document
1
)
and
the
announcement
of
the
agencys
preliminary
decision
(
position
document
2/3
.
the
agency
considers
all
significant
comments
before
reaching
a
final
decision
.
the
formal
special
review
process
can
prove
to
be
resource
intensive
and
timeconsuming
time
consuming
due
in
part
to
its
discrete
stages
and
the
opportunities
provided
for
public
comment
.
the
government
accounting
office
(
gao
)
issued
reports
in
1980
and
1986
concluding
that
the
office
of
pesticide
programs
(
opp
)
was
not
completing
reviews
of
potentially
hazardous
pesticides
in
a
timely
manner
.
similarly
,
in
1984
,
the
house
of
representatives
committee
on
government
operations
found
that
the
special
review
process
was
not
quickly
reaching
decisions
on
potential
risks
that
were
found
to
be
associated
with
certain
pesticide
uses
.
recently
,
the
agencys
office
of
inspector
general
(
oig
)
conducted
an
audit
of
the
special
review
process
and
presented
its
results
in
a
final
report
dated
07/22/1993
.
this
report
,
while
critical
of
some
aspects
of
the
special
review
process
and
the
time
involved
in
completing
the
reviews
,
also
raised
concerns
about
using
negotiated
settlement
agreements
to
achieve
pesticide
risk
reduction
rather
than
initiating
new
special
reviews
.
the
oig
concluded
that
negotiated
settlement
agreements
do
achieve
risk
reduction
more
quickly
than
the
formal
special
review
process
,
but
was
concerned
that
negotiated
decisions
were
made
between
the
agency
and
pesticide
registrants
at
the
expense
of
public
involvement
.
the
report
also
reflected
concern
that
the
agency
does
not
notify
the
public
of
risk
concerns
while
a
decision
is
being
made
whether
or
not
to
formally
initiate
a
special
review
;
ie
,
during
the
prespecial
special
review
(
that
period
of
time
after
a
preliminary
(
grassleyallen
grassley
allen
)
notification
is
sent
to
the
registrants
but
before
issuance
of
the
public
announcement
(
position
document
1
)
initiating
the
special
review
.
other
mechanisms
are
available
to
achieve
pesticide
risk
reduction
at
a
more
accelerated
pace
than
is
afforded
through
a
normal
special
review
.
they
include
the
issuance
of
a
position
document
1/2/3
which
combines
the
first
two
position
documents
issued
in
the
formal
special
review
process
into
one
.
this
is
used
when
enough
information
is
available
at
the
outset
of
a
special
review
to
fully
assess
the
risks
and
benefits
and
reach
a
proposed
decision
.
additional
mechanisms
include
issuing
notices
of
intent
to
cancel
(
noic
,
suspension
orders
,
or
emergency
suspension
orders
as
provided
under
fifra
section
6
.
these
mechanisms
can
be
used
to
remove
pesticides
from
the
market
that
pose
significant
risks
or
imminent
hazards
.
although
the
agency
has
used
all
of
these
different
means
in
the
past
to
effect
pesticide
risk
reduction
,
recently
,
negotiated
settlement
agreements
have
been
used
more
and
more
frequently
.
through
the
process
of
negotiation
,
the
agency
and
the
registrants
)
reach
a
mutual
agreement
that
legally
commits
the
registrants
)
to
specific
measures
that
will
reduce
potential
risks
associated
with
a
pesticides
use
.
such
measures
typically
include
modifying
the
terms
of
registration
by
cancellation
of
uses
,
changing
use
patterns
,
changing
application
methods
,
or
altering
the
manufacturing
formula
.
the
same
scientific
principles
and
weightofevidence
weight
of
evidence
information
that
govern
the
decisions
made
during
a
formal
special
review
also
apply
to
negotiated
settlements
;
that
is
,
carefully
analyzing
risks
,
benefits
,
and
alternative
pest
control
methods
to
ensure
that
the
risk
reduction
measures
desired
will
not
result
in
risks
that
outweigh
the
benefits
or
that
risks
are
reduced
to
the
greatest
extent
practical
while
data
are
being
generated
to
better
understand
the
risks
associated
with
the
use
of
the
pesticide
.
the
agreements
also
make
every
effort
to
ensure
that
a
pesticide
use
will
not
shift
to
an
alternative
pesticide
or
pest
control
method
of
equal
or
greater
risk
concern
or
result
in
the
trading
of
one
risk
for
another
.
by
using
the
same
analyses
as
those
used
in
a
formal
special
review
,
the
public
and
the
environment
should
be
afforded
the
same
level
of
protection
in
a
more
timely
fashion
.
the
main
difference
is
that
the
special
review
process
formally
provides
opportunities
for
public
involvement
before
reaching
risk
reduction
decisions
.
in
all
negotiated
settlement
agreements
,
the
agency
reserves
the
right
to
take
additional
regulatory
action
if
evidence
arises
that
warrants
it
.
similarly
,
the
agency
can
remove
restrictions
if
additional
data
are
reviewed
later
that
indicate
risks
are
of
less
concern
than
previously
thought
.
negotiated
settlement
agreements
,
however
,
should
not
be
viewed
as
an
exclusive
mechanism
to
achieve
a
final
risk
reduction
decision
.
they
may
be
used
to
reach
an
ultimate
goal
of
the
agency
such
as
use
cancellation
or
use
reduction
,
or
they
may
be
used
as
an
interim
measure
to
reduce
risks
while
additional
data
are
being
generated
,
or
during
any
stage
of
an
ongoing
special
review
prior
to
the
agency
making
its
final
decision
.
although
the
agency
has
been
criticized
for
neglecting
to
include
affected
constituency
groups
(
eg
,
users
and
public
interest
groups
)
in
risk
reduction
decisions
made
through
negotiated
settlement
agreements
and
for
not
making
the
general
public
aware
of
risk
concerns
for
pesticides
being
considered
for
the
formal
special
review
process
,
several
steps
already
have
been
taken
to
open
up
the
decisionmaking
decision
making
process
to
the
public
whenever
possible
.
specific
examples
of
how
the
agency
has
provided
for
public
involvement
in
recent
negotiated
settlement
agreements
are
provided
below
.

parathion
.
.
in
09/19/1991
,
due
to
concerns
of
acute
poisonings
to
workers
exposed
to
parathion
,
the
agency
reached
a
negotiated
settlement
agreement
with
the
registrants
whereby
all
but
nine
uses
of
parathion
were
voluntarily
canceled
.
the
agency
held
public
hearings
in
12/19/1992
to
solicit
public
involvement
and
gain
additional
information
on
the
risks
and
benefits
of
the
remaining
nine
uses
.
these
hearings
were
held
in
amarillo
,
texas
;
lincoln
,
nebraska
;
and
baltimore
,
maryland
and
were
announced
in
the
federal
register
to
encourage
all
interested
parties
to
participate
.
the
agency
also
polled
state
and
regional
offices
for
advice
and
input

in
06/19/1992
,
in
an
effort
to
reduce
the
amount
of
exposure
to
persons
applying
24d
and
therefore
reduce
potential
risks
,
the
agency
met
with
the
24d
task
force
and
requested
that
they
include
enduser
end
user
input
in
the
development
of
such
measures
.
also
,
through
meetings
and
telephone
conversations
,
the
agency
actively
included
distributors
and
endusers
end
users
to
help
develop
effective
and
fair
exposure

measures

.
according
to
40
cfr
154
35
,
the
agency
must
publish
a
notice
in
the
federal
register
to
modify
an
earlier
determination
in
a
way
that
might
increase
a
risk
that
was
the
subject
of
a
special
review
.
during
the
final
stages
of
the
special
review
of
granular
carbofuran
,
the
agency
negotiated
a
settlement
agreement
with
the
registrants
to
phase
out
most
uses
.
in
order
to
extend
the
registration
for
the
use
of
carbofuran
on
rice
,
the
agency
formally
requested
public
comment
as
required
under
40
cfr

.
the
denial
of
extensions
of
registrations
for
two
other
uses
,
corn
and
sorghum
,
did
not
require
such
request
for
comment
.
the
agency
,
however
,
announced
in
the
federal
register
its
decision
to
deny
extension
of
the
registration
for
corn
and
sorghum
uses
and
allowed
the
opportunity
for
comment
from
affected
individuals
or
groups

.
due
to
its
concerns
regarding
the
hazards
azinphosmethyl
azinphos
methyl
posed
to
fish
from
use
on
sugarcane
in
louisiana
,
the
agency
reached
an
agreement
with
the
registrants
to
amend
their
registrations
in
04/19/1993
.
the
agreement
,
including
prescription
use
,
was
the
result
of
a
cooperative
effort
between
the
agency
,
louisiana
state
officials
,
and
the
pesticide
registrants
.
through
the
use
of
public
workshops
held
in
louisiana
to
collect
additional
information
about
azinphosmethyl
azinphos
methyl
use
and
alternative
pesticides
,
the
agency
advanced
the
use
of
negotiated
settlement
agreements
by
actively
soliciting
public
input
that
contributed
to
the
decisionmaking
decision
making
process
.
the
workshops
were
announced
in
the
federal
register
and
participation
of
all
interested
parties
was
encouraged
.
furthermore
,
in
order
to
keep
the
public
better
informed
of
its
risk
concerns
,
the
agency
has
,
as
a
matter
of
general
policy
,
made
available
to
the
public
those

established
for

which
have
had
private

issued
for
6
months
but
have
not
yet
had

will
continue
this

mechanisms
that
may
provide
opportunities
for
public
input
that
the
agency
has
not
frequently
used

will
consider
in
the
future
,
include
the
following
:

section
6b2
.
this
section
of
fifra
allows
the
agency
to
issue
a
notice
to
hold
hearings
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
registration
should
be
canceled
or
its
classification
changed
and
`

comment
.
in
fact
,
the
administrative
conference
of
the
united
states
recently
adopted
recommendation
935
concerning
procedures
for
regulation
of
pesticides
.
one
of
its
final
recommendations
was
that
epa
provide
public
notification
of
pesticide
risk
concerns
once
negotiations
begin
,
publicize
the
availability
of
a
public
docket
,
the
proposed
settlement
and
establish
a
`
compliance
docket
'
to
address
the
effectiveness
of
the
mitigated
measures
formally
adopted
.
this
recommendation
was
published
in
the
federal
register
of
02/01/1994
(
59
fr
4675
.
the
agency
is
committed
to
the
responsibilities
set
forth
in
fifra
and
views
pesticide
risk
reduction
as
an
evolving
process
where
flexibility
is
a
key
element
for
successfully
reducing
risk
posed
by
pesticides
.
for
this
reason
,
the
agency
feels
that
having
the
option
of
several
mechanisms
to
achieve
risk
reduction
provides
for
effective
strategies
that
suit
the
varied
situations
that
may
present
themselves
.
each
of
the
options
lends
itself
to
particular
circumstances
when
other
risk
reduction
mechanisms
would
prove
less
effective
;
therefore
,
the
agency
will
continue
to
consider
all
of
the
options
available
to
promote
safe
and
beneficial
pesticide
use
.
iii
.
general
policy
to
provide
for
public
involvement
it
is
the
agencys
responsibility
to
investigate
all
registered
pesticides
thought
to
cause
unreasonable
adverse
effects
to
human
health
or
the
environment
and
to
reduce
those
