under

the

one
of
the
problems
with
not
giving
customer
limit
orders
priority
is
the
cost
to
public
customers
in
terms
of
inferior
or
missed
executions
for
limit
orders
.
it
is
currently
impossible
for
customers
to
monitor
these
costs
.
the
ability
of
a
customer
to
monitor
the
cost
of
the
transaction
and
choose
a
brokerdealer
broker
dealer
on
that
basis
imposes
a
competitive
discipline
on
the
market
maker
to
achieve
the
best
possible
execution
for
the
customer
or
risk
losing
the
business
.
unlike
institutional
clients
who
are
in
a
better
position
to
negotiate
their
own
protection
with
market
makers
,
public
customers
have
less
viable
alternatives
in
determining
where
their
orders
are
ultimately
sent
for
execution
.
under
these
circumstances
,
market
makers
lack
the
same
incentive
to
provide
superior
executions
to
public
customers
.
market
makers
who
oppose
a
comprehensive
rule
mandating
limit
order
priority
for
customers
do
so
in
part
on
the
ground
that
such
a
rule
would
reduce
their
return
from
market
making
.
24
market
makers
are
,
of
course
,
entitled
to
earn
a
profit
from
their
service
;
a
limit
order
rule
could
force
market
makers
to
recoup
the
cost
of
the
transaction
in
ways
more
apparent
to
the
customer
,
such
as
by
charging
a
commission
for
handling
the
limit
order
.
the
commission
requests
comment
in
the
form
of
specific
data
regarding
the
potential
consequences
of
the
proposed

for
