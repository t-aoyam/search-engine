although
as
noted
above
,
the
issue
of
the
continuing
validity
of
oshas
earlier
risk
assessment
was
not
remanded
to
the
agency
for
reconsideration
,
implicit
in
oshas
proposal
to
lower
the
pel
to

f
cc
is
oshas
determination
based
on
the
1984
risk
assessment
,
that
the
lower
exposure
limit
is
necessary
to
reduce
a
still
significant
occupational
risk
.
after
a
comprehensive
review
of
the
evidence
submitted
concerning
the
validity
of
the
1984
risk
assessment
,
osha
has
determined
that
it
will
continue
to
rely
on
the
earlier
analysis
.
the
agency
believes
that
the
studies
used
to
derive
risk
estimates
remain
valid
and
reliable
,
and
that
oshas
decision
to
not
separate
fiber
types
for
purposes
of
risk
analysis
is
neither
scientifically
nor
regulatorily
incorrect
.
there
are
at
least
three
reasons
for
oshas
decision
not
to
separate
fiber
types
.
first
,
osha
believes
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
supports
similar
potency
for
chrysotile
and
amphiboles
with
regard
to
lung
cancer
and
asbestosis
.
the
evidence
submitted
in
support
of
the
claim
that
chrysotile
asbestos
is
less
toxic
than
other
asbestos
fiber
types
is
related
primarily
to
mesothelioma
.
this
evidence
is
unpersuasive
,
and
it
provides
an
insufficient
basis
upon
which
to
regulate
that
fiber
type
less
stringently
.
as
osha
explained
in
the
preamble
to
the
1986
standards
,
*
*
*
*
*
*
to
summarize
the
data
on
risk
differential
by
asbestos
fiber
type
,
human
epidemiological
studies
have
suggested
that
occupational
exposure
to
amphiboles
is
associated
with
a
greater
risk
of
mesothelioma
than
is
exposure
to
chrysotile
*
*
*
*
*
*
no
clear
risk
differential
for
lung
cancer
or
other
asbestosrelated
asbestos
related
disease
has
been
demonstrated
by
epidemiological
studies
.
animal
experiments
,
however
,
have
indicated
that
chrysotile
is
a
more
potent
carcinogen
than
amphiboles
when
administered
by
inhalation
or
intrapleural
injection

osha
agreed
with
the
testimony
of
dr
.
davis
,
who
stated
that
`
the
evidence
cannot
answer

*
*

*
*
if

one

second
,
as
stated
in
the
1986
asbestos
standard
,
even
if
osha
were
to
accept
the
premise
(
which
it
does
not
,
that
chrysotile
may
present
a
lower
cancer
risk
than
other
asbestos
fiber
types
,
occupational
exposure
to
chrysotile
asbestos
still
presents
a
significant
risk
of
disease
at
the
revised
pel
(
see
51
fr
22649
,
22652
.
in
particular
,
asbestosis
,
the
disabling
and
often
fatal
fibrosis
of
the
deep
portions
of
the
lung
,
is
caused
by
exposure
to
all
types
of
asbestos
.
the
evidence
on
this
is
strong
and
no
new
information
has
been
presented
to
contradict
this
.
as
stated
above
,
osha
estimated
asbestosis
risks
at
02
f
cc
exposures
as
an
unacceptably
high

cases
per
1000
workers
.
thus
,
asbestosis
risks
alone
justify
the
regulation
for
chrysotile

risks
associated
with
chrysotile
exposures
are
also

that

that
`

not
a

third
,
the
record
shows
that
employees
are
likely
to
be
exposed
to
mixed
fiber
types
at
most
construction
and
shipyard
industry
worksites
most
of
the
time
.
assigning
a
higher
pel
to
chrysotile
would
present
the
agency
and
employers
with
analytical
difficulties
in
separately
monitoring
exposures
to
different
fiber
types
.
thus
,
regulating
different
fiber
types
at
differing
levels
,
would
require
more
monitoring
all
the
time
and
would
produce
limited
benefits
(

fr

.
consequently
,
osha
believes
that
its
conclusion
to
treat
all
asbestos
fibers
as
having
a
similar
potency
in
the
occupational
setting
remains
valid
.
