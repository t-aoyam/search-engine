under
this
interpretation
,
facilities
located
within
two
miles
from
one
another
,
but
in
different
contiguous
nonattainment
areas
,
could
not
trade
credits
with
one
another
,
but
could
trade
credits
with
a
facility
located
100
miles
away
in
the
same
nonattainment
area
.
this
is
not
consistent
with
the
policy
relating
to
stationary
sources
,
which
can
trade
offsets
between
one
nonattainment
area
and
another
in
the
northeast
ozone
transport
region
.
this
policy
was
established
in
a
03/31/1993
letter
from
john
seitz
,
the
director
of
the
office
of
air
quality
planning
and
standards
to
bruce
s
.
carhart
,
the
executive
director
of
the
ozone
transport
commission
.
furthermore
,
epa
has
no
reason
to
believe
that
trading
would
not
be
equitable
across
the
two
nonattainment
areas
.
therefore
,
the
regions
position
is
that
since
the
new
jersey
program
exists
in
two
contiguous
severe
nonattainment
areas
within
the
state
,
trading
should
be
allowed
across
the
nonattainment
area
boundaries
in
the
new
jersey
program
,
and
epa
proposes
to
accept
this
provision
of
the
new
jersey
rule
.

.
giving
full
credit
for
alternative
fuel
vehicles
the
states
rule
allows
for
not
including
alternatively
fueled
vehicles
as
a
vehicle
in
the
calculation
of
occupancy
rates
.
epas
policy
has
been
that
alternatively
fueled
vehicles
may
be
exempted
from
counting
as
a
full
vehicle
.
epa
believes
that
this
provision
of
the
new
jersey
rule
will
have
a
minor
impact
on
the
programs
effectiveness
since
it
is
unlikely
that
many
employees
will
have
access
to
alternative
fueled
passenger
cars
.
it
is
more
likely
that
some
multipassenger
passenger
vans
or
buses
will
be
alternatively
fueled
and
these
will
be
excluded
from
the
count
of
vehicles
because
of
their
capacity
even
without
the
exclusion
for
alternative
fuels
.
therefore
,
epa
proposes
to
accept
this
provision
of
the
new
jersey
rule
.
4
.
giving
full
credit
for
seven
and
eight
passenger
vehicles
the
states
rule
counts
vanpools
arriving
at
the
worksite
with
seven
or
eight
employees
as
`
zero
vehicles
arriving
'
epas
policy
allows
only
nine
passenger
and
greater
vehicles
not
to
be
counted
as
a
vehicle
arriving
at
a
worksite
.
epa
believes
that
although
this
provision
in
the
rule
will
allow
some
smaller
vans
and
larger
station
wagons
carrying
seven
or
eight
employees
to
be
excluded
from
the
count
of
vehicles
arriving
at
a
worksite
,
that
this
will
not
be
a
significant
number
of
vehicles
beyond
those
already
excluded
by
epas
policy
and
will
allow
employers
the
flexibility
to
arrange
for
vehicles
of
a
size
which
best
fits
their
needs
.
therefore
,
epa
proposes
to
accept
this
provision
of
the
new
jersey
rule
.
iv
.
conclusion
in
this
proposal
,
epa
is
proposing
to
approve
the
sip
revision
submitted
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
which
contains
the
etr
program
.
this
submittal
addresses
and
implements
each
of
the
program
elements
required
by
section
182d1b
)
of
the
clean
air
act
.
as
a
result
,
epa
is
proposing
to
approve
this
submittal
.
nothing
in
this
proposed
rule
should
be
construed
as
permitting
or
allowing
or
establishing
a
precedent
for
any
future
request
for
revision
to
any
state
implementation
plan
.
each
request
for
revision
to
the
state
implementation
plan
shall
be
considered
separately
in
light
of
specific
technical
,
economic
,
and
environmental
factors
and
in
relation
to
relevant
statutory
and
regulatory
requirements
.
sip
approvals
under
section
110
and
subchapter
i
,
part
d
of
the
clean
air
act
do
not
create
any
new
requirements
,
but
simply
approve
requirements
that
the
state
is
already
imposing
.
therefore
,
because
the
federal
sipapproval
sip
approval
does
not
impose
any
new
requirements
,
i
certify
that
it
does
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
any
small
entities
affected
.
moreover
,
due
to
the
nature
of
the
federalstate
federal
state
relationship
under
the
clean
air
act
,
preparation
of
a
regulatory
flexibility
analysis
would
constitute
federal
inquiry
into
the
economic
reasonableness
of
state
action
.
the
clean
air
act
forbids
epa
to
base
its
actions
concerning
