the
available
data
show
that
poisonings
are
occurring
in
large
measure
because
of
the
efforts
of
children
.
table

shows
that
in
9
of
the
21
reported
pediatric
poisoning
deaths
that
involved
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
packaged
in
containers
with
crcs
,
the
victims
gained
access
to
multiple
doses
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
product
by
their
own
efforts
or
through
the
efforts
of
another
child
.
most
of
these
children
were
under
51
months
of
age
.
thus
,
a
label
warning
statement
is
unlikely
to
have
any
meaning
or
significance
to
them
.
fda
requests
comments
on
its
tentative
conclusion
that
label
warning
statements
are
not
sufficient
to
ensure
that
the
use
of
certain
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
will
be
safe
.
comments
that
bear
on
the
effectiveness
of
labeling
warning
statements
to
deter
young
children
from
directly
gaining
access
to
these
products
will
be
most
compelling
if
they
contain
supporting
data
and
information
.
as
stated
above
,
fda
believes
that
label
warning
statements
will
help
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
pediatric
poisoning
because
they
will
ensure
that
adults
are
aware
of
the
pediatric
toxicity
of
iron
and
will
encourage
responsible
adults
to
properly
reclose
and
store
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
however
,
fda
is
concerned
that
warning
statements
alone
will
not
prevent
the
misuse
of
crps
that
has
contributed
to
the
epidemic
of
iron
poisonings
of
children
.
fda
notes
that
crps
themselves
are
a
de
facto
warning
that
the
contents
of
the
package
present
hazards
for
children
.
yet
,
in
21
of
the
26
pediatric
poisoning
deaths
in
which
the
type
of
packaging
was
reported
,
the
product
was
packaged
in
containers
with
crcs
(
table
4
.
furthermore
,
the
effectiveness
of
label
warning
statements
is
generally
considered
to
be
dependent
on
several
factors
including
,
but
not
necessarily
limited
to
:
the
personal
relevance
of
the
warning
information
;
familiarity
with
the
warning
information
;
perceived
hazard
from
the
product
;
and
desensitization
or
habituation
to
warnings
after
repeated
exposures
(
ref
.
24
.
moreover
,
a
report
on
the
effectiveness
of
a
labeling
and
educational
program
to
prevent
pediatric
poisonings
from
accidental
ingestion
of
prescription
drugs
shows
that
labeling
and
educational
programs
are
not
always
sufficient
to
prevent
pediatric
poisonings
,
and
that
,
in
some
instances
,
additional
packaging
safeguards
are
necessary
to
ensure
the
safe
use
of
certain
substances
(

.
therefore
,
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
label
warning
statements
will
not
be
sufficient
to
ensure
the
safe
use
of
certain
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
fda
finds
that
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drugs
and
dietary
supplements
pose
a
unique
hazard
to
young
children
.
the
pediatric
hazard
presented
by
these
products
is
directly
related
to
their
iron
content
.
as
discussed
above
in
section
ib
.
of
this
document
,
ingestion
of
25
mg
or
more
iron
per
kg
of
body
weight
is
considered
a
toxic
dose
,
and
ingestion
of
100
to
200
mg
iron
per
kg
of
body
weight
can
be
lethal
.
once
a
potentially
lethal
dose
of
iron
has
been
ingested
and
absorbed
,
medical
intervention
to
halt
the
toxic
progression
of
iron
poisoning
is
difficult
and
often
unsuccessful
.
successful
treatment
for
iron
poisoning
is
determined
primarily
by
the
amount
of
iron
ingested
and
how
rapidly
medical
intervention
occurs
.
in
light
of
the
risk
of
pediatric
iron
poisonings
with
irreversible
and
potentially
fatal
consequences
that
is
presented
by

iron
containing

,
and
of
the
inherent
limitations
on
the
effectiveness
of

and
educational
programs
,
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
rely
solely
on
these
measures
to
ensure
the
safe
use
of
these
products
.
b
.
are
noncomplying
crps
a
principal
cause
of
iron
poisoning
deaths
?
the
ndma
contends
that
new
packaging
requirements
beyond
those
outlined
in
its
petition
are
not
necessary
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
pediatric
iron
poisonings
.
the
ndma
petition
asserts
that
the
available
data
on
pediatric
ironpoisonings
iron
poisonings
are
deficient
to
the
extent
that
it
cannot
be
determined
whether
products
associated
with
the
poisonings
were
packaged
in
compliance
with
cpscs
packaging
requirements
,
and
it
suggests
that
ironcontaining

products
packaged
in
noncompliant
crps
are
the
principle
cause
of
pediatric

iron
poisonings
.
however
,
ndma
provided
no
information
to
support
its
view
.
fda
has
carefully
examined
the
available
information
on
pediatric
iron
poisonings
and
could
find
no
evidence
to
support
the
ndmas
contention
that

packaged
in

that
did
not

established
by

in
the
absence
of

fda
can
find
no
basis
on
which
to
conclude
that

childresistant

c
.
are
additional
packaging
requirements
appropriate
?
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
full
compliance
with
cpscs

requirements
,
even
if
there
are
warning
statements
in
labeling
of
ironcontaining
iron

appropriate

,
will
not
be
adequate
to
ensure
the
safe
use
of
certain
ironcontaining
iron
containing
drugs
and
dietary
supplements
if
bottle
and
closure
packaging
were
to
continue
as
the
predominant
means
of
packaging
such
products
.
fda
recognizes
that
each
of
these
measures
either
has
been
successful
in
limiting
the
number
of
poisonings
or
can
be
reasonably
expected
to
be
effective
in
reducing
the
number
of
poisonings
.
however
,
given
the
potentially
fatal
outcome
that
can
result
from

,
fda
is
not

these

fda
tentatively
concludes
that

reduce

a
level
that
would
permit
the

to
conclude
that
there

a
reasonable

it
is
necessary

therefore
,
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
additional

requirements
are
necessary

fda
requests
comments
on
this
tentative
conclusion
.
the

is
particularly
interested
in
receiving
comments
that
bear
on
the
effectiveness
of
different
types
