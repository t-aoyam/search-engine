one
related
issue
is
whether
to
require
respirator
use
for
employees
when
changing
filters
or
bags
from
vacuums
.
osha
proposed
that
they
not
be
required
when
changing
hepa
filters
,
noting
that
filter
changes
occurred
infrequently
,
recorded
fiber
levels
during
changes
were
not
excessive
,
and
other
requirements
triggered
by
respirator
use
,
such
as
medical
examinations
and
fit
testing
procedures
,
did
not
appear
to
confer
any
significant
benefit
to
employees
.
one
participant
,
mr
.
clayton
,
who
initially
disagreed
with
oshas
proposal
not
to
require
respirators
for
filter
changes
,
clarified
that
the
ancillary
requirements
for
a
respirator
program
,
`
would
scare
everybody
away
from
wanting
to
do
it
*
*
*
*
*
*
and
would
be
a
rather
heavy
burden
for
most
employers
'
(
tr
.
1931
.
mr
.
clayton
pointed
out
that
exposure
potential
existed
not
only
during
filter
changes
,
but
during
vacuum
bag
changes
as
well
.
he
further
pointed
out
that
although
hepa
filter
changes
were
infrequent
,
bags
`
could
be
changed
as
often
as
every
three
to
five
weeks
by
a
shop
'
(
id
at
1929
.
mr
.
clayton
described
two
systems
of
ensuring
that
bag
changing
does
not
expose
employees
to
asbestos
containing
dust
.
under
one
system
the
bag
is
collected
under
negative
pressure
;
under
the
other
the
bag
is
made
from
nonwoven
woven
material
and
is
`
virtually
undestructible
'
osha
has
concluded
that
so
long
as
filters
and
vacuum
bags
are
changed
using
work
practices
to
minimize
rupture
and
spillage
,
exposure
from
that
activity
will
be
de
minimis
,
and
respirator
use
is
not
required
to
protect
employees
.
accordingly
,
additional
work
practices
relating
to
filter
changes
,
when
a
vacuum
is
used
,
are
included
in
the
standard
.
osha
is
allowing
another
method
to
be
used
in
shops
in
which
brake
work
comprises
only
a
minor
portion
of
the
workload
,
and
thus
where
employee
exposure
is
infrequent
and
minimal
.
for
those
shops
in
which
brake
work
is
infrequent
,
osha
has
determined
to
allow
the
use
of
a
wet
method
of
control
as
a
`
preferred
'
method
.
therefore
,
in
facilities
in
which
no
more
than
5
pairs
of
brakes
or
5
clutches
,
or
some
combination
totaling
5
,
are
repaired
each
week
,
the
mechanic
technician
may
control
potential
asbestos
exposure
through
the
use
of
a
pump
sprayer
(
bottle
)
containing
water
or
amended
water
to
wet
down
the
drum
or
clutch
housing
before
it
is
removed
and
to
control
fiber
release
during
subsequent
activities
.
the
mechanic
may
use
other
implements
to
deliver
the
water
such
as
a
garden
hose
;
however
,
the
resulting
waste
water
generated
must
be
caught
and
properly
disposed
of
without
allowing
it
to
dry
on
any
surfaces
.
osha
anticipates
that
the
use
of
a
spray
bottle
will
be
adequate
to
control
the
dust
without
generating
a
large
volume
of
waste
water
,
however
any
waste
water
generated
must
be
disposed
of
properly
.
osha
applied
a
qualitative
analysis
using
its
risk
management
expertise
in
making
the
decision
that
allows
less
effective
controls
for
facilities
that
do
5
or
fewer
brake
and
5
or
fewer
clutch
repair
jobs
per
week
.
relevant
factors
were
the
magnitude
of
the
risk
of
asbestos
caused
disease
estimated
in
the
1986
risk
assessment
at
levels
of
exposure
in
vehicle
repair
facilities
,
the
duration
of
exposure
,
and
the
practicality
of
using
controls
in
the
industry
.
in
describing
the
usual
work
practices
of
mechanics
performing
brake
jobs
,
mr
.
swartz
of
midas
corporation
reported
that
it
was
occasionally
necessary
for
the
mechanic
technician
to
dislodge
a
`
frozen
'
brake
drum
;
this
was
usually
performed
by
striking
it
with
a
hammer
(
ex
.
1176
.
when
performed
within
an
enclosure
under
negative
pressure
,
this
operation
would
be
unlikely
to
expose
the
worker
to
asbestos
fibers
;
however
,
when
using
the
other
methods
it
is
essential
that
the
exterior
of
the
drum
,
especially
around
the
seams
,
be
thoroughly
wetted
to
minimize
fiber
release
.
osha
concurs
and
thus
will
require
that
before
attempts
are
made
to
dislodge
a
`
frozen
'
brake
drum
,
the
drum
must
be
thoroughly
wetted
.
other
comments
were
received
which
dealt
with
minor
alterations
in
wording
which
would
render
the
requirements
clearer
and
more
specific
and
some
of
these
have
been
incorporated
into
the
language
of
appendix
f
(
appendix
l
in
the
shipyard
employment
standard
.
several
participants
noted
that
additional
activities
,
such
as
inspection
and
disassembly
of
brakes
could
also
result
in
exposure
and
should
be
included
.
mr
.
swartz
explained
that
brakes
are
frequently
checked
to
determine
whether
they
are
defective
and
this
involves
removal
of
the
drums
and
results
in
potential
exposure
to
asbestoscontaining
asbestos
containing
dust
(
tr
.
1843
.
osha
agrees
that
these
activities
should
be
covered
by
the
rule
and
has
included
them
in
the
language
of
the
final
rule
.
therefore
the
following
activities
will
be
listed
and
will
require
implementation
of
the
provisions
of
the
mandatory
appendix
f
(
appendix
l
in
the
shipyard
employment
standard
:
clutch
and
brake
inspection
,
disassembly
,
repair
and
assembly
