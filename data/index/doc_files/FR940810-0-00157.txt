analysis
[

,

described
in
detail
the
controls
that
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
a
pel
of
02
f
cc
in
each
of
the
affected
sectors
in
general
industry
.
osha
determined
that
compliance
with
the
02
f
cc
pel
was
feasible
through
the
use
of
wet
methods
,
engineering
controls
,
and
housekeeping
practices
.
in
addition
,
for
the
following
operations
compliance
with
the
pel
of
02
f
cc
was
generally
not
achievable
without
the
use
of
respirators
:
the
dry
mechanical
process
in
a
c
pipe
manufacturing
and
the
dry
mechanical
,
wet
mechanical
,
and
nuclear
ripout
processes
in
ship
repair
.
compliance
with
the
1
f
cc
excursion
limit
promulgated
in
the
1988
rulemaking
was
also
expected
to
lead
to
occasional
respirator
use
in
highexposure
high

activities
throughout
primary
and
secondary
manufacturing
[
osha
,
1988
.
for
the
revised
pel
of
01
f
cc
,
some
manufacturing
operations
will
need
to
supplement
engineering
controls
and
work
practices
with
respiratory
protection
.
in
all
,
2345
workers
(
or
less
than
1
percent
of
the
682685
workers
exposed
in
all
affected
industry
sectors
)
in
general
industry
are
expected
to
need
respirators
at
least
part
of
the
workday
in
order
to
maintain
exposures
below
the
revised
pel
.
since
all
affected
employers
in
general
industry
will
be
able
to
comply
with
the
proposed
pel
through
the
use
of
engineering
controls
or
,
where
necessary
,
respirators
,
osha
concludes
that
the
proposed
pel
is
technologically
feasible
.
in
addition
to
respirators
,
ancillary
controls
will
also
be
needed
in
affected
industry
process
groups
as
a
result
of
the
lowering
of
the
pel
.
these
controls
include
:
&
bullregulated
areas
;
&
bulldisposable
protective
clothing
and
gloves
;
&
bullchangerooms
and
lockers
;
&
bullshower
rooms
;
&
bulllunch
areas
;
and
&
bullannual
update
of
the
written

program
.
all
ancillary
controls
required
by
the
revised
general
industry
standard
are
currently
in
extensive
use
throughout
industry
and
are
therefore
technologically
feasible
.
