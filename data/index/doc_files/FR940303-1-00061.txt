fsis
is
proposing
to
require
that
the
protein
in
meat
derived
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
and
recovery
systems
have
a
protein
quality
value
that
is
a
protein
digestibilitycorrected
digestibility
corrected
amino
acid
score
of
not
less
than
40
expressed
as
a
percent
.
the
protein
digestibilitycorrected
digestibility
corrected
amino
acid
score
would
be
required
to
be
determined
by
methods
given
in
sections
541
,
721
,
and

in
the
`

who
expert

on

quality
evaluation
'
which
is
incorporated
by

in
the
proposed
rule
.
the
proposed
protein
digestibilitycorrected
digestibility
corrected
amino
acid
score
or
not
less
than
40
expressed
as
a
percent
is
consistent
with
nutrition
labeling
requirements
for
protein
in
foods
for
children
older
than
one
but
less
than
four
years
of
age
,
as
provided
in
21
cfr

,
which
fsis
crossreferenced

in
its
final
nutrition

regulations
(

)
in

.
fsis
believes
this
value
protects
the
young
consumer
from
inadequate
nutrition
from
the
use
of
poor
quality
protein
(
ie
,
protein
that
does
not
meet
the
dietary
needs
for
growth
)
and
,
in
turn
,
protects
people
other
than
young
consumers
.
fsis
also
believes
it
is
appropriate
to
assure
comparability
of
the
meat
derived
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
systems
with
that
derived
by
handdeboning
hand
deboning
to
maintain
the
quality
and
integrity
of

supply
.
fsis
is
proposing
to
permit
an
alternative
measurement
to
the
protein
digestibilitycorrected
digestibility
corrected
amino
acid
score
method
,
which
requires
a
digestibility
measurement
in
addition
to
an
amino
acid
analysis
,
to
control
the
cost
of
monitoring
compliance
with
the
protein
quality
requirement
.
fsis
is
proposing
that
,
for
the
purpose
of
measuring
the
protein
quality
of
meat
derived
from
advanced
meat
bone
separation
machinery
and
recovery
systems
,
an
alternative
measurement
of
protein
quality
would
be
allowed
that
is
comparable
to
the
protein
digestibilitycorrected
digestibility
corrected
amino
acid
score
.
this
measure
would
be
based
on
a
comparison
between
the
`
essential
amino
acid
content
of
meat
'
and
`
total
amino
acids
present
in
meat
'
ie
,
an
essential
amino
acid
content
of
at
least
33
percent
of
the
total
amino
acids
present
in
the
meat
.
essential
amino
acid
content
includes
isoleucine
,
leucine
,
lysine
,
methionine
,
phenylalanine
,
threonine
,
and
valine
content
,
and
the
total

present
include

,

,
alanine
,
aspartic
acid
,
glutamic
acid
,
glycine
,
proline
,
serine
,
and
hydroxyproline
content
.
the
essential
amino
acid
content
would
be
required
to
be
determined
by
methods
given
in
sections
541
,
721
,

in

'
which
is
incorporated
by

in

.
fsis
continues
to
believe
that
meat
found
to
be
in
compliance
by
the
proposed
amino
acid
content
measurement
would
have
protein
of
high
quality
.
this
belief
is
supported
by
the

evaluation
of
an
expert
work
group
that
was
organized
by

departments

in

to
