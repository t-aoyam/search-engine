that

therefore
osha
had
reviewed
and
evaluated
in
the
earlier
rulemaking
a
portion
of
the
evidence
submitted
by
proponents
of
differential
regulation
of
fiber
types
,
and
had
rejected
the
claim
that
chrysotile
should
be
regulated
less
stringently
.
some
new
evidence
on
the
issue
of
differential
risks
of
asbestos
fiber
types
was
submitted
by
both
supporters
and
detractors
of
that
theory
.
in
support
of
the
position
that
chrysotile
asbestos
exposure
is
equivalent
in
risk
to
amphibole
asbestos
exposure
,
bctd
submitted
studies
which
indicated
excess
mesothelioma
cases
in
workers
exposed
solely
to
chrysotile
asbestos

in
support
of
the
opposing
claim
that

reduced

,
aiana
and
sba
submitted
additional
evidence
.
for
example
,
aiana
submitted
the
world

recommended
that
the
exposure
limit
for

be

it

in
particular
,
two
papers

are
cited
as
the
basis
for
the
claim
that
a
scientific
`

'
believes
that
chrysotile
carries
a
reduced
carcinogenic
risk
(

thus
aiana
states
that
`
since
osha
issued
its
1984
asbestos
risk
assessment
,
the
scientific
consensus
that
chrysotile
asbestos
poses
lesser
risks
has
solidified
'
(

however
,
osha
notes
that
various
participants
in
this
rulemaking
,
including
niosh
and
dr
.
nicholson
,
disputed
the
existence
of
such
a
consensus

dr

nicholson
and
others
including
dr

landrigan
,
in
a
letter
to

(

,
dispute
various
interpretations
of
data
in
mossman
et
als
paper
,
and
challenge
the
conclusion
that
chrysotile
asbestos
carries
little
cancer
risk
.
nicholson
et
al
,
point
out
that
human
studies
show
excess
lung
cancer
risk
that
is
proportionate
to
exposure
across
all
fiber
types
,
and
that
animal
tests
confirm
these
relationships
.
osha
believes
that
the
scientific
community
has
not
achieved
`
consensus
'
on
these
issues
.
among
the
studies
submitted
in
support
of
the
lowered
risk
of
chrysotile
asbestos
,
are
those
of
churg
,
and
others
showing
that
the
lung
burden
of
mesothelioma
victims
is
predominantly
amphibole
,
even
though
high
chrysotile
exposure
levels
were
reported
.
as
noted
above
,
this
line
of
argument
was
presented
in
the
earlier
asbestos
rulemaking
,
and
osha
had
concluded
that
lung
burden
studies
are
inconclusive
.
additional
response
to
this
argument
is
provided
by
dement
who
notes
that
`
the
biological
significance
of
postmortem
mortem
lung
fiber
burden
data
has
yet
to
be
established
.
these
data
are
not
useful
as
a
predictor
of
disease
for
several
reasons
.
chrysotile
is
known
to
split
longitudinally
and
partially
dissolve
in
the
lung
whereas
amphiboles
remain
in
the
lungs
for
years
without
significant
dissolution
*

.
measurements
of
tissue
fiber
burdens
many
years
after
first
exposure
may
bear
no
relationship
to
the
carcinogenic
events
which
likely
have
taken
place
many
years
before
clinical
manifestation

cancer

(

bctd
pointed
out
in
its
posthearing
hearing
brief
,
that
`
dr
.
landrigan
testified
,
while
the
observation
that
chrysotile
does
not
last
as
long
in
the
lungs
as
other
forms
of
asbestos
is
not
new
knowledge
(
tr
.
1074
,
there
is
recent
evidence
that
chrysotile
is
`
the
most
effective
of
the
three
major
fiber
types
at
migrating
to
the
pleura
,
that
it
is
present
in
substantial
amounts
in
pleural
plaques
and
mesotheliomas
,
even
in
circumstances
where
it
is
not
present
or
minimally
present
in
the
lungs
themselves
'
(

the
agency
also
notes
that
the
hei
report
,
in
summing
up
its
discussion
of
its
literature
search
of
studies
examining
the
issue
of
the
relative
potency
of
chrysotile
in
inducing
mesothelioma
,
stated
:
`
the
evidence
that
chrysotile
rarely
causes
pleural
mesothelioma
is
not
conclusive
`
*
*
*
*
*
and
concluded
that
the
absence
of
mesothelioma
in
one
of
the
`
two
cohorts
of
heavily
exposed
asbestos
workers
who
worked
only
with
chrysotile
