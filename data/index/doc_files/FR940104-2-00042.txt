(

requires
us
to
prepare
and
publish
a
regulatory

for
any
notice
that
meets

of

we
propose
to
revise
our
national
policy
and
to
withdraw
medicare
program
coverage
for
npt
testing
in
the
sleep
disorder
clinic
.
because
we
do
not
have
a
national
policy
regarding
npt
testing
in
other
settings
,
we
propose
to
exclude
coverage
,
rather
than
withdraw
coverage
,
for
npt
testing
by
plethysmography
and
other
monitoring
devices
in
all
other
settings
.
in
calendar
year
1992
,
medicare
payment
for
npt
testing
totaled
approximately
$
840000
for
13000
allowed
services
.
this
is
an
increase
of
approximately
26
percent
in
expenditures
and
a
3
percent
increase
in
the
number
of
services
over
the
previous
year
.
we
anticipate
that
future
costs
or
savings
as
a
result
of
this
notice
would
be
negligible
.
this
notice
would
not
meet
the
$
100
million
criterion
nor
would
it
meet
the
other
eo

12291
criteria
.
therefore
,
this
notice
is
not
a
major
rule
under
eo
.
12291
,
and
an
initial
regulatory
impact
analysis
is
not
required
.
b

regulatory

act
we
generally
prepare
a
regulatory

analysis
that
is
consistent
with
the
regulatory
flexibility
act
(

)
(

601
through

)
unless
the
secretary
certifies
that
a
notice
would
not
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
.
for
purposes
of
the
rfa
,
all
physicians
,
sleep
disorder
clinics
,
and
manufacturers
of
devices
for
performing
the
npt
test
are
considered
to
be
small
entities
.
in
addition
,
section
1102b
)
of
the
act
requires
the
secretary
to
prepare
a
regulatory
impact
analysis
if
a
notice
may
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
operations
of
a
substantial
number
of
small
rural
hospitals
.
this
analysis
must
conform
to
the
provisions
of
section
603
of
the
rfa
.
for
purposes
of
section
1102b
)
of
the
act
,
we
define
a
small

hospital
as
a
hospital
that
is
located
outside
of
a
metropolitan
statistical
area
and
has
fewer
than
50
