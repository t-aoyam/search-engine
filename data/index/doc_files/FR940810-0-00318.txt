some
terms
unique
to
asbestos
analysis
are
defined
below
:
amphibole
:
a
family
of
minerals
whose
crystals
are
formed
by
long
,
thin
units
which
have
two
thin
ribbons
of
double
chain
silicate
with
a
brucite
ribbon
in
between
.
the
shape
of
each
unit
is
similar
to
an
`
i
beam

asbestos
analysis
include

asbestos
:
a

for
naturally
occurring
fibrous
minerals
.

and
any
of
these
minerals
which
have
been
chemically
treated
or

the
precise

of

asbestos
fiber
:
a
fiber
of
asbestos
meeting
the
criteria
for
a
fiber
.
(
see
section
35
.
of
this
appendix
)
aspect
ratio
:
the
ratio
of
the
length
of
a
fiber
to
its
diameter
usually
defined
as
`
length
:
:
width
,
eg
.
31
.
brucite
:
a
sheet
mineral
with
the
composition
mgoh
)
.
.
central
stop
dispersion
staining
(
microscope
:
this
is
a
dark
field
microscope
technique
that
images
particles
using
only
light
refracted
by
the
particle
,
excluding
light
that
travels
through
the
particle
unrefracted
.
this
is
usually
accomplished
with
a
mccrone
objective
or
other
arrangement
which
places
a
circular
stop
with
apparent
aperture
equal
to
the
objective
aperture
in
the
back
focal
plane
of
the
microscope
.
cleavage
fragments
:
mineral
particles
formed
by
the
comminution
of
minerals
,
especially
those
characterized
by
relatively
parallel
sides
and
moderate
aspect
ratio
.
differential
counting
:
the
term
applied
to
the
practice
of
excluding
certain
kinds
of
fibers
from
a
phase
contrast
asbestos
count
because
they
are
not
asbestos
.
fiber
:
a
particle
longer
than
or
equal
to
5
&
mum
with
a
length
to
width
ratio
greater
than
or
equal
to
31
.
this
may
include
cleavage
fragments
.
(
see
section
35
of
this
appendix
.
phase
contrast
:
contrast
obtained
in
the
microscope
by
causing
light
scattered
by
small
particles
to
destructively
interfere
with
unscattered
light
,
thereby
enhancing
the
visibility
of
very
small
particles
and
particles
with
very
low
intrinsic
contrast
.
