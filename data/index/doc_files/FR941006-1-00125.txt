recently

in
establishing
these
regulations
,
cpsc
considered
the
degree
and
nature
of
the
hazard
to
children
from
accidental
acute
overdose
of
dietary
supplements
and

it

that
special
packaging
is
required
to
protect
children

from
ingesting

iron

and

.
this

was
based
on

review
of
labeling
issues
in
citizen
petitions
as
noted
in
section

.
of
this
document
,
the
ag
and
ndma
petitions
agreed
that
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
should
bear
label
warning
statements
.
however
,
these
petitions
did
not
agree
on
what
the
warning
should
state
,
or
on
how
it
should
appear
on
the
label
.
in
requesting
the
labeling
provisions
described
in
section
id1
.
of
this
document
,
the
ag
petition
stated
that
the
hazard
presented
by
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
is
the
result
,
in
part
,
of
the
perception
that
they
are
nontoxic
household
products
.
thus
,
according
to
this
petition
,
they
are
likely
to
be
left
within
easy
reach
of
children
and
not
kept
properly
secured
.
the
petition
also
noted
that
these
products
are
extremely
attractive
to
children
because
of
their
typical
candylike
candy
like
appearance
and
sweet
outer
coating
and
pointed
to
case
reports
that
illustrate
how
children
ingest
iron
tablets
in
large
quantities
(
see
table
4
.
the
ag
petition
stated
that
the
recent
increase
in
iron
poisoning
deaths
among
children
might
reflect
an
increase
in
the
extension
of
primary
health
care
,
especially
prenatal
care
.
it
noted
:
`
while
more
doctors
are
prescribing
prenatal
iron
supplementation
to
more
women
,
there
has
been
no
concomitant
increase
in
warnings
regarding
their
potentially
lethal
effects
'
the
ag
petition
also
noted
that
,
while
more
women
were
using
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
,
the
labeling
of
these
products
does
not
reflect
the
dangers
inherent
in
their
misuse
:
while
labeling
for
a
few
multivitamins
vitamins
containing
iron
bears
the
statement
that
iron
can
be
harmful
in
large
doses
,
most
iron
supplements
bear
only
the
nonspecific
specific
phrase
,
`
keep
out
of
reach
of
children
'
few
,
if
any
,
packages
of
iron
supplements
contain
the
word
`
warning
'
or
`
caution
'
words
universally
accepted
as
denoting
danger
,
to
alert
the
user
to
the
dangers
of
iron
overdose
.
further
,
the
meager
statements
that
do
exist
are
,
for
the
most
part
,
printed
in
the
same
color
and
type
size
as
other
material
on
the
label
and
therefore
fail
to
catch
anyones
attention
.
the
statements
are
often
obscured
within
other
small
print
on
the
labeling
and
are
neither
prominent
nor
specific
enough
to
reach
parents
with
a
warning
about
these
pills
'
potential
fatal
effect
on
children
.
consumers
who
have
no
knowledge
of
irons
hazards
before
purchasing
iron
supplements
will
not
gain
that
knowledge
by
purchasing
the
product
and
examining
the
label
.
the
ag
petition
presented
data
showing
that
many
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
commonly
available
do
not
carry
any
label
information
conveying
the
need
to
keep
the
product
out
of
the
reach
of
children
or
conveying
any
message
specific
to
iron
poisoning
.
a
summary
,
which
was
included
as
part
of
the
ag
petition
,
of
the
label
information
found
on

commonly
available
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
revealed
that
10
of
the
25
did
not
include
information
on
the
label
that
the
product
should
be
kept
away
from
children
,
and
that
17
did
not
contain
information
stating
that
iron
could
be
harmful
.
six
of
the
products
had
no
cautionary
information
at
all
,
and
none
of
the
products
that
did
have
cautionary
information
used
the
terms
`
warning
'
or
`
caution
'
to
accompany
the
statements
on
the
label
.
ndma
,
in
its
petition
,
stated
that
its
proposed
warning
label
was
more
appropriate
than
that
proposed
in
the
ag
petition
because
its
warning
goes
beyond
awareness
in
its
focus
and
extends
its
message
to
include
information
that
is
preventive
in
nature
,
ie
,
`
close
tightly
'
and
treatment
oriented
,
ie
,
`
in
case
of
accidental
overdose
seek
professional
assistance
immediately
'
ndma
also
argued
for
allowing
for
flexibility
in
the
manner
in
which
the
warning
statement
is
to
be
applied
to
the
label
.
the
petition
stated
:
it
has
been
the
experience
of
ndma
members
in
implementing
the
associations
label
readability
guidelines
that
such
factors
as
contrast
,
color
,
type
size
,
substrate
,
paragraphing
,
etc
.
are
interrelated
related
in
a
complex
way
on
labeling
,
such
that
goal
-
oriented
flexibility
is
perhaps
the
most
important
principle
in
assuring
prominence
to
special
label
language
.
that
is
to
say
,
specifying
a
box
,
when
boxed
labeling
may
already
be
stipulated
under
nlea
regulations
,
is
not
necessarily
as
good
a
way
to
ensure
prominence
to
label
language
as
is
a
more
flexible
approach
whose
goal
is
to
ensure
that
the
language
is
conspicuous
,
prominent
and
clearly
distinguishable
from
other
labeling
.

(

if

what

does
the
