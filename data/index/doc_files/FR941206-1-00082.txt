the
agency
also
believed
it
necessary
to
identify
compliance
provisions
for
the
work
practice
standards
because
significant
emission
reductions
will
be
achieved
through
the
work
practice
standards
.
obviously
,
direct
measurement
of
emissions
is
not
appropriate
because
emission
points
being
controlled
by
work
practices
are
not
point
sources
that
emit
through
a
stack
.
all
of
the
recordkeeping
associated
with
work
practices
is
required
by
the
proposed
rule
to
be
included
in
the
work
practice
implementation
plan
.
the
agency
believed
that
the
least
complicated
way
to
ensure
continuous
compliance
would
be
to
require
a
semiannual
compliance
certification
that
states
that
the
work
practice
implementation
plan
is
being
followed
.
compliance
certifications
submitted
on
a
semiannual
basis
are
required
for
a
source
that
uses
compliant
materials
or
an
averaging
approach
,
and
for
a
source
demonstrating
compliance
with
the
work
practice
implementation
plan
.
these
compliance
certifications
are
analogous
to
the
compliance
certification
required
by
the
parts
70
and
71
operating
permit
programs
.
therefore
,
the
compliance
certification
required
by
these
proposed
standards
are
consistent
with
other
regulatory
actions
that
may
also
apply
to
the
affected
source
.

selection
of
reporting
and
recordkeeping
requirements
in
discussing
the
reporting
and
recordkeeping
requirements
,
the
committee
agreed
on
the
types
of
records
required
and
the
reporting
frequency
it
considered
appropriate
for
this
source
category
.
as
with
the
compliance
and
monitoring
requirements
,
the
committee
focused
solely
on
the
general
information
that
should
form
the
basis
of
the
reporting
and
recordkeeping
requirements
.
the
agency
has
developed
a
specific
regulatory
framework
identifying
reporting
and
recordkeeping
requirements
that
builds
on
the
general
principles
agreed
to
by
the
committee
.
the
general
provisions
(
subpart
a
)
to
part
63
include
general
reporting
and
recordkeeping
requirements
that
apply
to
sources
for
which
a
neshap
has
been
developed
,
or
will
be
developed
,
pursuant
to
section
112
of
the
act
.
the
requirements
of
the
general
provisions
,
in
conjunction
with
the
committees
decisions
,
form
the
basis
for
the
reporting
and
recordkeeping
provisions
of
the
proposed
rule
.
a
summary
of
these
provisions
is
provided
in
table
6
.
for
sources
using
control
devices
,
all
of
the
reporting
and
recordkeeping
requirements
of
the
general
provisions
apply
.
the
general
provisions
are
particularly
directed
to
sources
that
are
using
a
control
device
,
and
that
will
therefore
be
conducting
an
initial
performance
test
and
performing
traditional
emission
or
process
parameter
monitoring
.
as
such
,
for
sources
that
are
using
compliant
coatings
or
an
averaging
approach
to
demonstrate
compliance
with
the
proposed
rule
,
some
sections
of
the
general
provisions
do
not
apply
.
table
6
summarizes
those
sections
of
the
general
provisions
requiring
reporting
or
recordkeeping
and
identifies
whether
all
sources
are
subject
to
the
section
or
just
sources
using
control
devices
.

small

considerations
because
of
the
large
number
of
small
businesses
that
could
potentially
be
impacted
by
regulation
of
the
wood
furniture
industry
,
the
committee
considered
carefully
the
impact
of
each
aspect
of
the
proposed
standards
on
small
businesses
.
the
committee
included
two
small
wood
furniture
manufacturers
and
a
representative
of
a
trade
association
consisting
primarily
of
small
businesses
.
a
small
business
work
group
was
formed
to
specifically
address
small
business
issues
.
