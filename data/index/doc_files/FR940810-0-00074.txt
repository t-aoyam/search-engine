repair
osha
is
adding
a
mandatory
appendix
to
its
asbestos
standard
for
general
industry
and
to
the
shipyard
employment
standard
.
this
appendix
specifies
the
engineering
controls
and
work
practices
to
be
followed
during
brake
and
clutch
work
.
two
methods
of
control
are
`
preferred
'
the
enclosure
hepa
vacuum
method
and
the
low
pressure
recycle
method
.
in
operations
in
which
such
work
is
infrequent
(
ie
,
establishments
performing
fewer
than
5
brake
jobs
per
week
,
simple
wet
methods
are
included
among
the
`
preferred
'
controls
.
also
,
use
of
`
equivalent
'
methods
of
control
is
permitted
.
in
the
07/20/1990
proposed
revision
of
the
general
industry
asbestos
standard
,
osha
proposed
that
the
employer
comply
with
the
standard
by
implementing
one
of
three
specified
methods
of
engineering
controls
and
work
practices
to
control
asbestos
exposure
during
automotive
brake
and
clutch
repair
and
assembly
operations
.
these
methods
were
the
enclosed
cylinder
hepa
vacuum
system
,
the
spray
can
solvent
system
,
and
the
wet
brushrecycle
brush
recycle
method
.
detailed
requirements
for
these
three
methods
were
set
out
in
proposed
appendix
f
.
once
having
properly
used
one
of
these
methods
,
the
employer
would
have
been
exempt
from
other
requirements
of
the
standard
.
osha
preliminarily
found
that
the
use
of
these
methods
would
routinely
result
in
exposure
levels
below
the
pel
.
the
proposal
also
would
have
allowed
the
employer
to
comply
with
the
standard
by
using
an
`
equivalent
'
method
,
which
follows
written
procedures
,
which
the
employer
demonstrates
can
achieve
results
equivalent
to
method
a
,
[
the
enclosed
cylinder
hepa
vacuum
system
,
proposed
1910
1001
(
fx
.
this
proposed
revision
differed
from
the
1986
standard
in
two
ways
.
the
earlier
standard
set
out
two
methods
of
reducing
exposure
in
a
nonmandatory
mandatory
appendix
.
secondly
,
the
controls
themselves
are
somewhat
different
;
one
method
,
the
wet
brushrecycle
brush
recycle
method
,
was
added
;
the
enclosed
cylinder
hepa
vacuum
system
was
revised
,
and
the
spray
can
solvent
system
is
retained
.
osha
endorsed
these
three
methods
based
primarily
on
the
results
of
a
niosh
study
completed
after
the
1986
standard
which
found
that
all
three
methods
effectively
reduced
exposure
levels
during
brake
drum
servicing
operations
to
below
the
proposed
pel
of
01
f
cc
(
ex
.
1112
.
in
the
final
standard
osha
lists
two
`
preferred
methods
'
the
wetbrush
wet
brush
recycle
methods
and
the
enclosure
hepa
vacuum
system
.
osha
is
deleting
the
solvent
spray
method
from
the
list
of
preferred
methods
.
osha
still
is
listing
the
above
two
methods
as
`
preferred
'
but
the
description
of
these
methods
is
more
generic
than
in
the
proposal
,
so
as
not
to
preclude
use
of
methods
which
differ
from
those
described
in
the
proposal
in
minor
ways
which
are
unlikely
to
affect
their
efficiency
.
in
addition
,
specific
training
provisions
are
added
to
ensure
that
work
practices
are
effectively
followed
.
like
the
proposal
,
`
equivalent
'
methods
are
allowed
so
long
as
required
training
is
held
.
the
employer
must
show
that
the
`
equivalent
'
method
can
reliably
achieve
exposures
below
the
pel
in
the
workplace
conditions
where
the
method
is
sought
to
be
used
.
in
addition
employers
using
such
`
equivalent
'
methods
must
demonstrate
by
exposure
data
from
their
workplaces
using
the
equivalent
method
,
or
by
reference
to
exposure
data
representing
conditions
similar
to
their
workplace
that
the
anticipated
exposure
reduction
in
fact
,
has
been
achieved
.
osha
believes
that
these
changes
will
allow
employers
to
choose
among
various
proven
approaches
and
encourage
the
development
of
new
devices
and
practices
which
effectively
reduce
exposures
in
brake
and
clutch
repair
facilities
.
considerable
comment
and
testimony
were
submitted
to
the
record
by
the
public
concerning
oshas
proposed
revisions
on
protection
for
automotive
repair
workers
.
information
concerning
additional
methods
to
achieve
asbestos
control
during
brake
repair
was
submitted
.
these
additional
methods
include
hepa
vacuum
systems
without
an
enclosed
cylinder
(
ex
.
7104
,
using
water
spray
instead
of
solvent
spray
(
ex
.
7104
,

,
enclosures
shaped
other
than
cylindrically
(

.

,
and
collecting
the
drips
of
sprays
from
the
solvent
spray
method
