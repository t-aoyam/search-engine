sections
905
146
,
905

,
and
905
148
of
the
regulations
provide
terms
and
conditions
under
which
shippers
may
ship
organically
grown
florida
citrus
fruit
,
as
special
purpose
shippers
,
with
a
conditional
release
from
certain
grade
requirements
issued
under
§
905
52
of
the
order
.
when
the
provisions
concerning
special
purpose
shipments
were
made
effective
in
1978
,
there
were
no
laws
governing
organic
fruit
and
vegetable
growers
in
florida
.
a
`
special
purpose
shipper
'
was
defined
under
the
marketing
order
as
one
who
had
certified
that
they
would
handle
only
citrus
fruit
which
they
knew
from
their
own
personal
knowledge
was
produced
on
trees
on
which
only
compost
,
nonacidulated
acidulated
fertilizer
such
as
rock
phosphate
,
dolomite
,
or
ground
limestone
is
used
,
and
to
which
no
chemical
insecticide
or
fungicide
had
been
applied
.
however
,
the
state
of
florida
now
requires
all
organically
grown
fruits
and
vegetables
to
be
certified
.
accordingly
,
the
committee
has
recommended
redefining
the
term
`
special
purpose
shipper
'
in
§
905
146
to
mean
a
person
who
handles
florida
citrus
fruit
that
is
certified
by
a
florida
department
of
agriculture
and
consumer
services
licensed
certifying
agent
as
organically
grown
under
florida
law
.
this
definition
reflects
that
organic
fruit
has
been
certified
under
florida
law
,
and
also
provides
additional
assurance
that
shippers
claiming
organic
status
and
utilizing
the
grade
standards
for
organic
fruit
qualify
to
do
so
.
under
florida
law
,
the
florida
department
of
agriculture
and
consumer
services
licenses
independent
third
parties
to
act
as
certifying
agents
.
growers
who
intend
to
sell
organic
fruit
make
an
application
to
a
certifying
agent
.
the
certifying
agent
inspects
and
certifies
a
growers
acreage
as
being
in
accordance
with
florida
law
and
issues
the
grower
a
certificate
.
the
certificate
number
is
transferred
to
a
trip
ticket
which
accompanies
any
shipments
of
fruit
grown
on
the
certified
acreage
.
when
the
handler
receives
the
shipment
,
a
copy
of
the
trip
ticket
is
provided
to
the
state
inspector
indicating
that
the
fruit
is
certified
organic
and
can
be
packed
using
the
applicable
organic
grade
standards
.
the
committee
also
recommended
that
§
905
146
be
revised
to
require
special
purpose
shippers
to
certify
that
they
will
limit
their
shipments
of
organically
grown
citrus
fruit
to
outlets
handling
organically
grown
fruits
.
this
replaces
the
requirement
that
only
outlets
registered
and
approved
by
the
committee
could
receive
such
fruit
and
ends
the
requirement
that
receivers
of
special
purpose
shipments
complete
the
applicable
sections
of
the
report
of
special
purpose
shipments
form
.
the

§
905
146
,
905
147
,
905
148
concerning
certificates
of
privilege
is
being
revised
for
clarity
,
and
procedural
safeguards
are
being
added
to
§
905
147
)
dealing
with
suspensions
or
denials
of
certificates
of
privilege
.
this
rule
reflects
the
committees
and
the
departments
appraisal
of
the
need
to
revise
the
exemption
provisions
for
special
purpose
shipments
,
as
specified
.
the
departmental
view
is
that
this
rule
may
have
a
beneficial
impact
on
growers
and
shippers
of
organic
citrus
fruit
.
based
on
the
above
,
the
administrator
of
the
ams
has
determined
that
this
rule
will
not
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
.
in
accordance
with
the
paperwork

of

and

this
action
will
reduce

on
