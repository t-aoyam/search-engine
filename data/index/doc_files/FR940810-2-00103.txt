the

of

may
be
examined
at
the
places
specified
in
item
iv
below
.
the
nasd
has
prepared
summaries
,
set
forth
in
sections
(
a
,
(

,
and
(

below
,
of
the
most

selfregulatory
self
regulatory
organizations
statement
of
the
purpose
of
,
and
statutory
basis
for
,
the
proposed
rule
change
the
nasd
is
proposing
an
amendment
to
the
interpretation
dealing
with
affirmative
determinations
made
by
members
,
or
those
persons
associated
with
such
members
,
in
connection
with
short
sales
.
the
proposed
amendment
to
the
interpretation
establishes
a
requirement
for
a
member
to
annotate
the
affirmative
determination
made
before
effecting
a
short
sale
.
the
affirmative
determination
requirement
already
appears
in
the
interpretation
and
requires
members
or
associated
persons
to
assure
that
securities
are
available
to
cover
the
short
position
.
the
interpretation
currently
requires
the
executing
member
or
an
associated
person
,
in
connection
with
any
sale
,
to
make
an
affirmative
determination
that
delivery
will
be
received
from
the
customer
or
that
the
securities
will
be
able
to
be
borrowed
by
settlement
date
.
for
long
sales
,
the
affirmative
determination
is
required
to
be
noted
on
the
order
ticket
at
the
time
the
order
is
placed
.
however
,
the
rule
does
not
require
that
such
determination
be
evidenced
in
any
specific
manner
for
short
sales
.
the
new
rule
would
require
members
or
associated
persons
to
annotate
,
on
the
trade
ticket
or
on
some
other
record
maintained
for
that
purpose
by
the
member
