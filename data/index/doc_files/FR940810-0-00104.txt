in

these

similar

which

in
the
proposal
,
the
agency
stated
that
it
did
not
believe
that
requiring
use
of
negative
pressure
enclosures
on
roofs
would
result
in
more
than
a
de
minimis
benefit
to
workers
removing
roofing
or
to
other
employees
in
their
vicinity
.
that
the
safety

which
might
be
imposed
by
their
use
on
roofs
would
outweigh
the
benefits
(

at

.
the
agency
proposed
that
employers
engaged
in
roofing
operations
take
additional
steps
to
reduce
employee
exposure
to
asbestos
.
these
steps
included
use
of
dusttight
dust
tight
chutes
to
lower
debris
from
the
roof
to
the
ground
,
or
immediate
bagging
and
lowering
of
debris
rather
than
dumping
it
from
a
height
.
wetting
would
also
be
required
where
feasible
to
reduce
contamination
.
the
agency
felt
that
these
measures
had
been
shown
to
be
effective
in
reducing
employee
and
bystander
exposures
during
roofing
operations
.
there
was
general
support
for
the
exemption
of
roofing
operations
from
the

is
well
supported
by

bctd
preferred
adoption
by
osha
of
the
recommendations
made
by
the
labor
representatives
of
accsh
which
are
more
rigorous
than
the
work
practices
proposed
by
osha
.
the
additional
practices
would
include
:
establishing
the
entire
roof
as
a
regulated
area
;
cutting
or
removing
acm
using
hand
methods
whenever
possible
;
equipping
all
powered
tools
with
a
hepa
vacuum
system
or
a
misting
device
;
hepa
vacuuming
all
loose
dust
left
by
the
sawing
operation
;
and
,
isolating
all
rooflevel

or
shutting

all
mechanical
systems
and
sealing
off
all
outside
vents
using
two
layers
of
6
mil
polyethylene
(
ex
.
34
.
as
noted
above
,
osha
has
adopted
most
of
these
additional
work
practices
in
the
final
regulations
.
osha
is
not
requiring
the
entire
roof
to
be
designated
as
a
regulated
area
:
the
portion
to
be
removed
may
be
a
small
part
of
the
entire
roof
.
the
regulated
area
should
encompass
that
portion
of
the
roof
where
dust
and
debris
from
the
removal
is
likely
to
accumulate
.
one
issue
concerning
required
controls
is
whether
osha
should
prohibit
power
cutting
on
roofing
materials
containing
asbestos
.
information
in
the
record
is
inconclusive
on
whether
power
cutting
usually
results
in
higher
exposure
levels
than
hand
cutting
.
a
representative
of
the
national
roofing
contractors
association
(
nrca
)
testified
that
`
were
finding
extremely
low
readings
(
on
the
power
cutter
;
*
*
*
*
*
*
it
appears
to
us
that
the
cutting
of
the
material
seals
the
edges
because
of
the
heat
of
the
blade
of
the
cutter
,
mixing
with
the
asphalt
'
(
tr
.
2427
.
other
data
were
submitted
to
show
that
power
cutting
elevates
asbestos
fiber
levels
compared
to
hand
cutting
;
however
osha
believes
that
some
of
these
conclusions
may
overstate
the
results
of
limited
experimentation
.
for
example
,
one
study
was
presented
as
suggesting
that
power
cutting
elevated
fiber
levels
over
hand
cutting
(
ex
1357
.
osha
regards
this
study
as
not
definitive
.
the
differences
in
fiber
levels
in
the
breathing
zones
of
workers
were
only
marginally
statistically
significant
,
and
there
was
another
variable
in
the
studys
protocol
which
may
have
effected
the
outcome
.
osha
recognizes
the
bound
nature
of
the
asbestos
in
most
roofing
materials
,
however
,
it
also
understands
the
physical
principles
involved
in
cutting
of
these
materials
and
that
such
actions
release
fibers
.
because
of
this
mixed
record
,
osha
concludes
that
no
prohibition
of
power
cutting
is
called
for
as
long
as
the
other
specified
precautions
including
misting
are
carefully
followed
.
the
standard
allows
power
cutting
,
but
also
requires
that
sections
of
roofing
material
shall
be
cut
into
the
largest
pieces
which
can
be
feasibly
handled
for
disposal
pursuant
to
the
standard
.
requiring
misting
of
power
tools
in
all
situations
except
where
a
competent
person
determines
that
misting
may
decrease
safety
is
expected
to
help
reduce
exposure
levels
from
power
cutting
.
the
general
requirement
that
all
asbestos
work
be
performed
wet
,
unless
the
employer
can
demonstrate
lack
of
feasibility
applies
to
roofing
operations
.
a
discussion
of
this
provision
is
found
above
in
the
discussion
on
paragraph
(
g1ib
.
as
noted
there
,
`
flooding
'
is
not
required
;
`
misting
'
of
cut
areas
is
sufficient
to
control
dust
.
