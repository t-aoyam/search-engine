supplementary
information
:
the
fmp
was
prepared
by
the
western
pacific
fishery
management
council
(
council
)
and
approved
and
implemented
by
the
secretary
of
commerce
(
secretary
)
at
a
time
when
there
were
few
problems
in
the
domestic
fisheries
for
management
unit
species
(
billfish
and
associated
species
)
and
the
hawaii
longline
fishery
consisted
of
less
than
40
relatively
small
vessels
fishing
primarily
near
the
hawaiian
islands
.
conditions
are
now
very
different
.
the
longline
fishery
based
in
hawaii
now
consists
of
167
vessels
up
to
101
ft
(
308
m
)
in
length
and
targets
swordfish
,
tuna
,
and
other
management
unit
species
.
vessels
often
travel
up
to
2000
miles
(
3219
km
)
from
port
.
due
to
the
rapid
growth
of
this
fishery
,
concern
was
raised
about
the
potential
and
actual
impact
of
the
expanded
fishery
on
the
status
of
some
fish
stocks
,
the
impact
of
increased
longline
catches
on
other
fisheries
,
and
interactions
between
longline
fishing
and
protected
species
such
as
hawaiian
monk
seals
and
sea
turtles
.
this
led
to
establishment
in
april
1991
of
a
3year
year
moratorium
on
new
entry
to
the
hawaii
longline
fishery
.
amendment
7
to
the
fmp
establishes
a
new
limited
entry
program
for
the
hawaiibased
hawaii
based
longline
fishery
.
the
limited
entry
program
requires
permits
that
will
be
freely
transferable
.
permit
owners
may
upgrade
their
vessels
or
transfer
their
permits
for
registration
with
other
vessels
provided
the
newly
designated
vessel
is
no
longer
than
101
ft
(
308
m
)
in
length
as
measured
in
accordance
with
the
rule
.
initial
permit
issuance
decisions
are
made
by
the
fisheries
management
division
,
southwest
region
,
nmfs
.
the
program
includes
provision
for
appeals
of
permit
decisions
to
the
regional
director
,
southwest
region
,
nmfs
(
regional
director
.
the
rule
includes
broad
framework
procedures
for
subsequent
adjustment
of
the
conservation
and
management
measures
for
the
pelagics
fisheries
to
provide
for
more
efficient
administration
of
the
fisheries
.
three
species
of
fish
are
added
to
the
management
unit
.
the
rule
also
makes
several
technical
changes
to
the
regulations
.
a
proposed
rule
to
implement
amendment
7
to
the
fmp
was
published
in
the
federal
register
on
02/24/1994
(
59
fr
9050
.
the
proposed
rule
(
1
)
described
in
detail
the
concerns
being
addressed
by
the
council
and
actions
taken
by
the
council
and
secretary
to
address
those
concerns
,
(

)
summarized
the
measures
proposed
in
amendment
7
and
the
objectives
of
the
amendment
,
and
(
3
)
indicated
the
reasons
for
other
regulatory
changes
proposed
.
those
discussions
will
not
be
repeated
here
.
after
consideration
of
public
comment
on
the
amendment
and
the
proposed
rule
,
amendment
7
was
approved
;
this
final
rule
implements
that
amendment
.
this
rule
is
consistent
with
the
administrative
procedure
act
(
5
usc
.
553
,
which
requires
that
final
rules
be
published
not
less
than
30
days
before
they
become
effective
.
in
the
period
between
publication
of
the
final
rule
and
the
effective
date
,
nmfs
will
advise
moratorium
permit
holders
of
the
need
to
submit
applications
and
supporting
information
in
a
timely
manner
so
that
new
limited
entry
permits
can
be
issued
by
the
effective
date
of
this
rule
.

on
the
adequacy
of
the
proposed
rule
and
complementary
actions
taken
by
the
council
and
nmfs
to
ensure
that
the
take
of
sea
turtles
in
the
longline
fishery
would
not
be
excessive
.
one
set
of
comments
was
received
in
response
.
summaries
of
comments
and
nmfs
responses
are
provided
below
.
comments
(
1
:
comments
favoring
the
amendment
were
received
from
40
people
.
most
of
these
were
on
petitions
from
workers
in
the
longline
fishery
or
support
industries
.
the
signers
supported
amendment
7
because
they
felt
it
would
provide
stability
,
promote
conservation
,
and
provide
vessel
owners
with
flexibility
needed
to
make
sound
business
decisions
.
in
addition
,
separate
letters
were
received
from
seven
permit
holders
supporting
the
amendment
.
they
felt
it
would
prevent
overfishing
and
adverse
impacts
on
other
fisheries
,
would
provide
needed
flexibility
to
vessel
owners
to
make
business
decisions
,
and
would
maintain
substantial
economic
benefits
to
the
fishery
participants
and
support
industries
.
all
commenters
supporting
the
amendment
noted
that
existing
area
closures
would
be
retained
so
that
there
should
be
no
adverse
effects
on
other
fisheries
.
response
(
1
:
none
needed
,
amendment
7
has
been
approved
and
is
being
implemented
by
this
final
rule
.
comment
(
2
:
one
individual
(
an
owner
of
several
of
the
larger
longline
vessels
with
permits
)
recommended
that
the
amendment
be
disapproved
because
the
fishery
is
already
showing
signs
of
economic
difficulty
,
with
longer
trips
,
smaller
fish
,
and
less
profit
.
in
the
commenters
view
,
allowing
further
vessel
upgrades
would
exacerbate
the
economic
difficulties
.
the
amendment
also
was
criticized
for
allowing
upgrading
of
smaller
vessels
while
prohibiting
upgrading
of
larger
vessels
.
