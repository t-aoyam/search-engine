waiver
process
comment
:
several
commenters
requested
guidance
concerning
the
process
for
seeking
a
delay
in
or
waiver
from
the
electronic
submission
requirement
.
the
commenters
also
wanted
to
know
under
what
circumstances
hcfa
would
grant
a
delay
or
waiver
.
commenters
suggested
that
hcfa
define
the
term
`
financial
hardship
'
as
used
in
the
proposed
rule
.
response
:
the
provider
reimbursement
manual
,
part
ii
,
section
130
,
provides
the
guidelines
for
requesting
a
waiver
.
basically
,
the
provider
must
make
a
written
request
to
the
intermediary
at
least
120
days
before
the
close
of
the
providers
cost
reporting
period
.
the
intermediary
reviews
the
request
and
forwards
it
,
with
a
recommendation
for
approval
or
denial
,
to
hcfas
central
office
within
30
days
of
receipt
of
the
request
.
the
central
office
informs
the
intermediary
whether
the
waiver
is
approved
or
denied
within
60
days
of
receipt
of
the
request
in
the
central
office
.
because
of
the
varying
financial
circumstances
of
hospitals
and
other
health
care
providers
that
participate
in
the
medicare
program
,
we
believe
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
establish
a
definition
of
`
financial
hardship
'
or
a
set
of
specific
criteria
that
a
provider
would
need
to
meet
to
qualify
for
a
waiver
of
the
electronic
cost
reporting
requirement
.
we
believe
that
the
best
method
for
determining
whether
a
provider
qualifies
for
a
waiver
is
to
consider
requests
on
a
case
by
case
basis
.
to
date
,
we
have
received
only
eight
requests
for
waiver
.
we
believe
that
the
small
number
of
requests
indicates
that
the
majority
of
providers
will
not
experience
financial
hardship
as
a
result
of
electronic
cost
reporting
.
in
addition
,
in
an
effort
to
minimize
the
number
of
providers
that
need
a
waiver
,
we
developed
a
software
package
that
will
enable
the
hospital
to
file
an
electronic
data
set
to
its
fiscal
intermediary
in
order
to
generate
an
electronic
cost
report
.
we
are
providing
the
software
package
to
hospitals
free
of
charge
.
therefore
,
we
believe
that
with
the
availability
of
the
free
software
,
it
will
be
difficult
for
a
provider
to
demonstrate
financial
hardship
.
comment
:
a
commenter
recommended
that
hcfa
provide
an
automatic
waiver
of
electronic
cost
report
filing
in
each
instance
in
which
a
waiver
of
standard
or
full
cost
reporting
has
been
granted
,
including
those
cases
where
full
cost
reporting
has
been
waived
because
of
a
low
percentage
of
medicare
inpatients
.
response
:
hcfa
will
grant
an
automatic
waiver
of
electronic
cost
reporting
if
a
provider
is
exempt
from
full
or
standard
cost
reporting
.
to
qualify
for
an
automatic
waiver
of
electronic
cost
reporting
,
the
provider
must
apply
and
qualify
for
an
exemption
from
full
or
standard
cost
reporting
in
accordance
with
the
rules
that
provide
for
the
exemption
.
for
example
,
a
provider
that
does
not
furnish
any
covered
services
to
medicare
beneficiaries
is
exempt
from
filing
a
full
cost
report
and
instead
must
submit
an
abbreviated
report
under
§
413
24
.
additionally
,
a
provider
with
low
program
utilization
may
obtain
a
waiver
from
filing
a
full
cost
report
in
accordance
with
§
413
24
.
when
the
intermediary
notifies
a
provider
that
it
qualifies
for
an
exemption
from
filing
a
full
cost
report
,
the
provider
also
will
be
notified
of
the
exemption
from
electronic
filing
.
providers
must
apply
for
a
waiver
of
full
cost
reporting
for
each
new
cost
reporting
period
.
providers
that
are
not
exempt
from
full
cost
reporting
must
file
for
a
waiver
according
to
the
procedure
set
forth
in
section
130
of
the
provider
reimbursement
manual
,
part
ii
,
as
discussed
above
.
