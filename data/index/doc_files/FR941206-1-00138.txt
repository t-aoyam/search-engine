there
are
sophisticated
criminal
elements
who
actively
seek
information
on
what
seemingly
are
minor
security
points
,
with
a
view
to
accumulating
a
larger
picture
of
the
entire
security
program
.
therefore
,
it
is
imperative
that
the
entire
security
program
be
protected
.
similarly
,
it
is
critical
to
protect
the
information
contained
in
security
directives
and
information
circulars
.
these
documents
contain
detailed
information
on
threats
that
the
faa
has
identified
,
and
the
measures
to
counter
those
threats
.
the
unauthorized
release
of
that
information
could
compromise
those
countermeasures
.
in
addition
,
particular
information
regarding
faa
approved
security
devices
,
such
as
metal
detectors
,
should
also
be
protected
to
the
extent
possible
.

information
currently
,
the
faa
,
airport
operators
,
air
carriers
,
indirect
air
carriers
,
and
foreign
air
carriers
are
required
to
restrict
the
availability
of
information
contained
in
security
programs
to
those
with
a
need
to
know
,
and
to
refer
requests
for
such
information
to
the
faa
.
these
requirements
are
in
§
1073e
,
1087c
)
(

)
and
(

,
1093c
,
and
foreign
air
carrier
security
programs
.
in
addition
,
§

)
specifically
requires
air
carriers
to
restrict
the
availability
of
security
directives
and
information
circulars
,
and
the
information
contained
therein
,
to
persons
with

however
,
individuals
who
work
for

perform

of
the

carriers
are
not
required
to
protect
the
information
,
except
for
security
directives
and

circulars
.
part
191
allows
the
faa
to
withhold
certain
requested
information
,
such
as
a
request
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
(

)
(

or

part

currently
applies
only
to
the

.
section
1913
identifies
specific
information
,
such
as
security
programs
and
hijacker
profiles
,
that
the
faa
withholds
.
section
1915
provides
generally
that
the
faa
prohibits
disclosure
of
information
when
release
would
constitute
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
privacy
,
reveal
trade
secrets
or
privileged
or
confidential
information
,
or
be
detrimental
to
the
safety
of
persons
traveling
in

transportation
or
in
intrastate

transportation
.
however
,
it
does
not
cover
all
of
the
potential
sources
of
sensitive
security
information
that
should
be
covered
.
civil
aviation
security
information
protected
under
the
federal
aviation
regulations
is
different
from
national
security
information
governed
by
executive
order
12356
and
related
orders
,
statutes
,
and
rules
.
the
executive
order
provides
for
classifying
information
as
top
secret
,
secret
,
and
confidential
,
and
covers
a
wide
range
of
information
affecting
the
national
security
.
all
persons
with
access
to
such
information
must
have
an
appropriate
security
clearance
,
and
there
may
be
a
criminal
penalty
for
misuse
of
the
information
.
while
there
is
some
`
classified
'
civil
aviation
security
information
,
these
proposed
rules
are
not
directed
to
the
handling
of
all
classified
information
.
the
faa
proposes
to
improve
the
protection
of
sensitive
security
information
by
amending
parts
107
,
108
,
129
and
191
as
described
more
fully
below
.
part
by
part
discussion
of
the
proposed
rule
the
faa
currently
is
reformulating
the
authority
citations
of
all
parts
in
accordance
with
the
recodification
enacted
in
public
law
103272
on
07/05/1994
.
this
process
is
not
complete
.
accordingly
,
the
authority
citations
in
this
proposed
rule
are
those
in
the
current
rules
.
part
191
part
191
sets
forth
the
rules
that
allow
the
faa
to
withhold
information
from
public
disclosure
.
the
faa
proposes
to
amend
and
reorganize
part
191
as
follows
:
§
1911
.
.
the
faa
proposes
to
expand
part
191
to
apply
not
only
to
the
faa
,
but
also
to
air
carriers
,
airport
operators
,
indirect
air
carriers
,
foreign
air
carriers
,
and
individuals
.
as
discussed
below
,
parts
107
,
108
,
109
,
and
129
still
would
contain
some
requirements
regarding
the
protection
of
information
,
but
part
191
would
be
the
primary
rule
for
withholding
information
from
unauthorized
public
disclosure
.
