training
for
the
competent
person
is
the
same
for
those
who
supervise
class
i
and
ii
asbestos
work
under
the
standard
.
the
training
must
be
obtained
in
a
course
which
is
the
equivalent
of
the
epa
supervisor
course
.
unlike
the
training
requirements
for
workers
for
class
ii
jobs
which
may
concentrate
on
a
particular
kind
of
material
if
that
is
the
only
asbestos
work
which
an
employee
does
,
the
`
competent
person
'
supervising
class
ii
jobs
must
be
trained
comprehensively
in
all
aspects
of
asbestos
related
construction
work
.
thus
,
for
example
,
a
flooring
removal
supervisor
must
be
informed
about
all
asbestos
removal
control
methods
:
this
is
the
person
who
must
evaluate
a
prospective
job
to
assure
that
the
pels
will
not
be
exceeded
,
who
must
choose
among
available
controls
to
reduce
exposures
,
and
must
know
how
to
supervise
extensive
control
systems
if
they
are
needed
for
high
exposure
class
ii
work
.
the
training
requirements
of
persons
supervising
class
iii
work
are
different
.
most
class
iii
work
is
maintaining
or
renovating
building
components
.
supervisors
of
such
work
need
not
be
trained
in
methods
of
abating
asbestos
material
on
a
large
scale
.
the
epa
asbestos
in
schools
rules
,
now
updated
to
encompass
commercial
and
public
buildings
requires
that
maintenance
workers
in
asbestoscontaining
asbestos

be
trained
in
a
16hour

course
which
includes

proper

asbestos

work
practices
,
waste

and
disposal
,
respirator

,
decontamination
procedures
,
and
the
content
of
applicable
federal
,
state
and
local
asbestos
regulations
.
all
class
iii
workers
and
their
supervisors
must
take
such
a
course
,
which
covers
all
control
measures
required
for
class
iii
work
.
in
this
regard
osha
notes
comments
which
stated
that
training
supervisors
of
plumbers
,
pipefitters
,
and
sheet
metal
workers
,
who
are
engaged
in
projects
of
incidental
removal
that
are
small
scale
and
short
term
,
in
full
enclosure
techniques
is
wasteful
(

.
although
the
formal
training
for
supervisors
and
workers
in
class
iii
work
is
the
same
,
additional
criteria
for
`
competency
'
contained
in
the
general
construction
standard
distinguish
worker
and
supervisor
on
all
asbestos
jobs
,
including
class

.
thus
,
the
`
competent

'
must
be
`
capable
of
identifying
existing
and
predictable
hazards

*
*
*
*

osha
notes
that
the

'
of
the

is
independent
of

.
`
competency
'
as
well
as

thus
,
a
`
competent

'
is
not
merely
someone
with

specified
level
of
training
but
connotes
a
high
level
of

length
,
and
method
of
training
contained
in

standard
.
training
for
`

'
for

work
depends
on
when
that
work
is
performed
.
when
class
iv
workers
perform
their
duties
in
facilities
and
buildings
where
no
other
asbestos
work
is
taking
place
,
the
`
competent
person
'
supervising
them
must
be
trained
in
an
epa
accredited
course
on
operations
and
maintenance
workers
or
its
equivalent
,
much
as
for
class
iii
work
.
if
cleanup
clean
work
is
done
within
a
regulated
area
,
supervision
of
the
cleanup
clean
must
be
conducted
by
the
`
competent
person
'
who
is
supervising
the
asbestos
job
for
which
the
area
was
established
,
which
in
most
cases
will
be
