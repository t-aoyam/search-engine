fsis
believes
that

differs
sufficiently
from
boneless
poultry
products
produced
by
traditional
handdeboning
hand
deboning
techniques
that
it
should
be
regulated
as
separate

standardized
ingredients
.
fsis
is
aware
that
other
descriptions
have
been
associated
with
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanically
separation
.
in
addition
to
the
use
of
terminology
such
as
`
finely
comminuted
'
poultry
to
specify
the
form
of
the
product
and
`
mechanically
deboned
'
poultry
,
such
product
has
been
referred
to
as
`
mechanically
separated
'
poultry
within
the
meat
and
poultry
industries
.
fsis
believes
that
where
a
distinguishing
characteristic
of
a
standardized
product
is
,
its
bone
solids
content
,
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
define
it
by
a
name
that
includes
the
term
`
deboned
'
and
use
of
this
term
in
labeling
might
mislead
consumers
by
implying
such
product
contains
no
bone
.
fsis
will
,
however
,
welcome
comments
on
other
names
that
accurately
reflect
the
process
from
which
this
product
is
derived

as
well
as
its
form
and

bone
solids
content
.
fsis
is
proposing
that
the
definition
and
standard
for
msk
)
incorporate
the
existing
restriction
on
the
bone
solids
content
of
mechanically
separated
poultry
products
of
not
more
than
1
percent
(

.
because
this
restriction
is
enforced
by
measuring
calcium
content
,
fsis
believes
the
definition
and
standard
for
msk
)
should
include
maximum
calcium
content
levels
of
not
more
than
0
235
percent
in
product
made
from
turkeys
or
mature
chickens
or
0
175
percent
in
product
made
from
other
poultry
,
as
a
measure
of
bone
solids
content
based
on
the
weight
of
product
that
has
not
been
heat
treated
.
as
previously
discussed
,
fsis
adopted
the
1
percent
bone
solids
restriction
after
appraising
the
operating
results
in
a
series
of
poultry
establishments
using
mechanical
deboning
equipment
,
analyzing
485
samples
of
raw
product
,
and
concluding
that
existing
equipment
can
be
operated
under
commercial
conditions
to
produce
product
which
meets
this
limit
(

.
when
processors
applied
the
mechanical
deboning
technology
to
poultry
products
such
as
fowl
frames
that
had
been
heat
treated
using
various
cooking
methods
,
fsis
modified
its
procedures
to
take
into
account
weight
loss
that
can
occur
with
cooking
.
thus
,
the
practice
has
been
to
permit
an
allowance
for
weight
loss
in
order
to
reflect
the
bone
solids
content
that
would
have
been
present
if
heat
treatment
had
not
occurred
;
and
the
adjusted
level
may
not
exceed
1
percent

after
evaluating
data
on
substances
of
potential
concern
that
may
tend
to
concentrate
in
bone
,
the
1979
report
on
health
and
safety
aspects
of
the
use
of
mechanically
deboned
poultry
did
not
recommend
any
change
in
the
existing
bone
solids
limit
.
because
enforcement
is
based
on
calcium
content
analyses
;
however
,
rather
than
direct
measurements
of
bone
solids
,
fsis
believes
that
an
amended
poultry
products
inspection
regulation
should
include
the
maximum
amount
of
calcium
permitted
in
determining
whether
mechanically
separated
poultry
is
in
compliance
.
fsis
has
developed
two
different
calcium
content
levels
for
this
purpose
.
both
of
these
levels
account
for
the
fact
that
poultry
tissues
,
other
than
bone
,
contain
some
calcium
.
the
higher
level0
235
percentreflects
the
greater
proportion
of
calcium
in
the
bones
of
mature
chickens
and
turkeys
as
compared
with
young
chickens
(
ie
,
the
lower
ratio
of
bone
solids
to
calcium
.
the
lower
level0
175
percenthas
been
used
by
fsis
in
enforcing
the
1
percent
restriction
on
product
made
from
young
chickens
.
both
of
these
calcium
levels
are
equivalent
to
1
percent
bone
solids
using
the
conversion
formulas
for
calculating
bone
solids
from
calcium
on
a
weight
basis

since
fsis
is
proposing
a
definition
and
standard
that
includes
potential
types
of
mechanically
separated
product

fsis
would

0

percent
calcium
as
the
maximum
for

that
is
made
from
poultry
other
than

.
the
inclusion
of
these
calcium

levels
in
the
proposed
definition
and
standard
should
not
be
misinterpreted
as
indicating
a
concern
about
the
amount
of
the
essential
nutrient
calcium
that
is
provided
by
poultry
and
meat
food
products
.
fsis
agrees
with
the
findings
in
the
1979
health
and
safety
report
that
,
even
assuming
all
further
processed
poultry
were
made
with
mechanically
deboned
poultry
(
ie
,
a
far
greater
level
of
production
and
use
than
actually
occurs
,
the
projected
calcium
contribution
of
such
products
would
represent
only
a
negligible
increase
in
per
capita
daily
intakes
and
cannot
be
considered
hazardous
,
particularly
since
the
dietary
intake
of
a
large
sector
of
the
population
may
be
below
the
recommended
level
of
calcium
consumption
