from
the

phase
,
upvg
has
developed
a
working
relationship
with
its
member
utilities
and
has
the
expertise
to
recruit
additional
utility
members
.
most
of
the
other
tasks
in
this
phase
are
also
extensions
of
work
previously
begun
by
upvg
,
such
as
information

and

market

.
the
techniques
required
for
successful
completion
of
the
proposed
tasks
are
available
at
upvg
and
have
already
been
demonstrated
in
the

quality
of
the
applicants
personnel
and
facilities
the
proposed
efforts
by
upvg
do
not
require
unique
facilities
or
equipment
.
the
team
proposed
by
upvg
has
significant
experience
in
the
development
and
deployment
of
pv
systems
,
and
should
be
capable
of
successfully
implementing
the
proposed
pv
program
.
the
team
includes
senior
personnel
from
several
different
organizations
,
including
private
consultants
with
experience
in
utility
projects
,
the
electric
power
research
institute
,
and
several
electric
utilities
.
the
upvg
executive
director
has
significant
experience
in
technology
transfer
and
the
management
of
associations
since
,
in
addition
to
upvg
,
he
also
provides
management
and
staff
support
to
the
fuel
cell
commercialization
group
,
the
national
hydrogen
association
,
and
the
utility
biomass
energy

association
.
in
addition
,
a
upvg
board
of
directors
was
previously
established
to
assist
in
management
,
financial
,
technical
,
and
other
issues
.
the
board
is
composed
of
personnel

appropriateness
and

of
the

budget
the
budget
proposed
for
the
anticipated
work
was
reviewed
and
is
considered
to
be
appropriate
and
adequate
.
a
total
of
$
1209000
will
be
required
for
the
program
,
with
$
1000000
provided
by
doe
for
the
period
of
02/15/1994
to
03/31/1995
.
cost
sharing
will
be
provided
by
upvg
in
the
amount
of
$
209000
.
the
upvg
program
represents
a
unique
approach
to
achieving
utility
involvement
with
pv
.
the
program
has
potential
to
result
in
nearterm
near
term
utility
applications
of
pv
technology
and
is
consistent
with
doe
objectives
.
the
proposed
project
is
not
eligible
for
financial
assistance
under
a
recent
,
current
,
or
planned
solicitation
.
competition
for
the
effort
would
have
a
significant
adverse
impact
on
the
continuity
and
completion
of
the
proposed
activity
.
the
upvg
is
the
only
organization
whose
sole
purpose
is
the
advancement
and
development
of
costeffective
cost
effective
utility
applications
of
pv
.
upvg
has
established
relationships
with
all
the
utility
participants
and
has
developed
an
understanding
of
the
technical
and
management
issues
required
for
successful
and
timely
accomplishment
of
program
objectives
.
therefore
,
recompetition
would
cause
a
time
delay
of
numerous
months
in
task
completion
and
would
require
a
significant
duplication
of
costs
to
enable
a
new
awardee
to
perform
the
proposed
tasks
