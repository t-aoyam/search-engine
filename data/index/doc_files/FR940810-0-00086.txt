where
the
employer
cannot
demonstrate
that
a

is
likely
not

the

paragraph
(
g5
)
sets
out
five
listed
control
methods
which
osha
has
evaluated
during
this
rulemaking
.
the
agency
finds
that
using
these
methods
pursuant
to
the
limitations
and
specifications
in
the
paragraph
is
likely
to
effectively
control
employee
exposures
when
performing
class
i
work
.
the
first
control
system
listed
for
class
i
work
is
the
negative
pressure
enclosure
system
(
or
npe
.
the
extent
to
which
osha
should
require
these
systems
for
major
asbestos
work
was
a
remanded
issue
.
as
discussed
in
detail
below
,
osha
has
found
that
npes
,
when
constructed
and
used
according
to
the
criteria
in
this
standard
,
can
be
effective
in
protecting
employees
within
and
outside
the
enclosure
.
other
listed
systems
also
may
be
used
for
class
i
work
under
stated
limitations
.
paragraph
(
g5
)
sets
out
these
limitations
.
these

glove
box

,
the

,
and
a

.
osha
emphasizes
the
use
of
the
term
`
system
'
each
method
consists
of
tangible
materials
and
devices
;
and
of
procedures
and

all
the

elements
must
be
complied
with
before
oshas

`

may
be
used
if
additional
notification
is
given
osha
,
and
if
a
specially
trained
`
project
designer
'
or
a
certified
industrial
hygienist
certifies
that
the
controls
will
be
protective
.
participants
in
this
rulemaking
requested
that
oshas
revisions
allow
alternative
systems
.
osha
agrees
that
asbestos
removal
technology
is
evolving
.
if
another
control
method
is
used
,
or
if
a
listed
control
method
is
`
modified
'
the
standard
requires
that
a
certified
industrial
hygienist
or
licensed
professional
engineer
who
is
also
qualified
as
a
project
designer
certify
the
control
method
using
the
criteria
set
out
in
the
regulatory
text
.
additional
discussion
of
these
issues
is
found
later
in
this
document
.
specific
issues
relating
to
methods
of
compliance
1
.
a
major
issue
in
this
proceeding
is
when
npes
should
be
required
.
in
the
1990
proposal
osha
would
have
required
the
erection
of
negative
pressure
enclosures
for
all
asbestos
removal
jobs
,
except
for
`
small
scale
short
duration
work
'
this
proposal
responded
to
the
courts
order
for
osha
to
clarify
the
conditions
under
which
negative
pressure
enclosures
were
required
in
the
1986
standard
(
see
discussion
on
issue
3
.
the
major
rationale
in
the
1986
standard
for
requiring
negative
pressure
enclosures
was
to
ensure
that
contamination
from
largescale
large
scale
asbestos
projects
did
not
spread
beyond
the
work
area
.
osha
there
stated
that
`
general
contamination
of
the
workplace
has
resulted
from
failure
to
confine
asbestos
using
strict
regulated
area
procedures
,
and
asbestosrelated
asbestos
related
diseases
have
been
found
in
workers
of
a
different
trade
exposed
to
asbestos
contamination
from
the
activities
of
asbestos
workers
'
(
55
fr
at
29716
.
the
effectiveness
of
npes
in
protecting
employees
working
within
the
enclosure
was
not
the
explicit
basis
for
their
adoption
in
the
1986
rule
.
in
the
1990
proposal
,
osha
primarily
based
the
requirement
for
universal
npes
for
major
asbestos
work
on
limited
data
relating
to
contamination
of
workspaces
adjacent
to
asbestos
work
,
and
reports
of
historic
disease
experienced
by
employers
in
trades
other
than
asbestos
work
who
worked
alongside
asbestos
workers
.
osha
stated
however
,
that
the
agency
`
has
not
been
able
to
estimate
the
risk
to
bystander
employees
*
*
*
*
*
'
and
asked
for
comment
and
data
on
their
exposure
(
55
fr
29716
.
osha
also
asked
for
information
about
alternatives
to
work
in
full
containment
,
such
as
glove
bag
and
box
systems
and
`
new
technologies
'
(
55
fr
29717
.
although
osha
proposed
more
tightly
drawn
exemptions
to
the
required
use
of
negative
pressure
enclosures
,
the
agency
also
raised
the
possibility
that
data
to
be
submitted
about
alternative
control
systems
might
result
in
a
limitation
,
rather
than
an
expansion
of
the
walkin
walk
in
enclosure
requirements
