summary
:
we
propose
to
modify
our
regulations
to
provide
for
the
electronic
filing
of
surety
bonds
,
trust
fund
agreements
,
certificates
of
insurance
and
cancellations
.
we
currently
receive
approximately
102000
such
filings
each
year
on
prescribed
printed
forms
,
most
of
which
are
filed
by
a
relatively
small
number
of
insurers
.
as
compared
to
the
printed
forms
and
mailed
filings
,
we
believe
that
electronic
filing
will
result
in
greater
time
and
cost
efficiencies
for
both
the
icc
and
insurers
.
electronic
filing
will
be
optional
,
and
insurers
may
continue
to
file
the
printed
forms
.

supplementary
information
:
we
automated
our
receipt
of
insurance
certificates
and
cancellation
notices
in
1983
.
since
that
time
,
the
commissions
computer
system
has
remained
unchanged
in
the
face
of
staff
cuts
and
increased
insurance
filings
.
the
current
system
is
maintained
on
a
contracted
timesharing
time
sharing
system
(
interactive
services
,
inc
)
dec
20/60
mainframe
computer
.
insurance
filings
are
processed
manually
,
with
visual
inspection
of
each
item
and
keying
in
the
data
.
if
the
insurance
filing
is
not
complete
or
the
computer
rejects
the
entry
,
a
rejection
letter
is
generated
and
mailed
to
the
insurance
company
.
an
insurance
master
file
is
used
to
generate
monthly
billings
to
insurance
companies
.
because
the
commissions
current
insurance
system
is
labor
intensive
,
and
thus
vulnerable
to
human
error
,
the
potential
exists
for
legal
liability
due
to
incomplete
or
inaccurate
insurance
data
on
file
at
the
commission
.
thus
,
it
is
crucial
that
we
develop
more
efficient
ways
to
handle
our
insurance
responsibilities
.
we
expect
a
significant
percentage
of
filings
to
be
made
electronically
.
for
example
,
one
insurer
,
which
accounts
for
a
large
number
of
the
agencys
monthly
insurance
filings
,
already
has
a
compatible
automated
system
,
and
must
reduce
the
filings
to
printed
form
for
filing
with
the
commission
.
this
proposal
eventually
will
improve
the
accuracy
and
timeliness
of
our
processing
and
reduce
the
overall
cost
to
the
commission
and
the
public
.
accordingly
,
we
propose
to
modify
our
regulations
to
permit
the
electronic
filing
of
all
surety
bonds
,
trust
fund
agreements
,
insurance
certificates
and
cancellations
.
electronic
filing
would
be
done
through
the
transmission
of
ascii
delimited
files
(
ie
,
all
records
must
have
the
same
number
of
fields
separated
by
commas
)
by
way
of
dialup
dial
access
to
a
local
telephone
number
in
the
washington
,
dc
,
metropolitan
area
.
we
welcome
comments
on
whether
the
ability
to
file
electronically
should
be
extended
to
all
of
these
forms
and
request
comments
specifically
on
electronic
filing
of
property
broker
security
instruments
(
bmc
84
surety
bond
and
bmc
85
trust
fund
agreement
.
in
that
regard
,
we
note
that
the
bmc
84s
and
bmc
85s
filed
are
the
actual
security
,
whereas
the
other
forms
certify
that
the
underlying
policy
or
bond
has
been
executed
.
we
currently
maintain
a
data
base
of
regulated
carriers
that
includes
insurance
information
and
other
data
.
the
electronic
filing
capability
we
propose
will
allow
us
to
maintain
electronically
the
insurance
information
on
that
data
base
,
rather
than
input
it
manually
from
the
printed
forms
,
without
requiring
a
major
rewrite
of
the
entire
system
.
while
a
more
sophisticated
system
could
offer
additional
advantages
,
such
as
immediate
,
twoway
two
way
electronic
communication
of
the
status
of
individual
insurance
transactions
,
our
limited
financial
resources
do
not
permit
the
development
of
such
a
system
at
this
time
.
we
believe
the
basic
system
we
propose
here
will
allow
us
to
achieve
the
more
important
advantages
,
while
staying
within
our
resource
limitations
.
however
,
we
invite
public
comment
on
how
this
limitation
might
be
overcome
,
perhaps
by
industry
initiative
,
and
invite
comment
on
other
alternative
approaches
.
commenters
should
discuss
whether
such
industry
involvement
would
be
ethical
.
