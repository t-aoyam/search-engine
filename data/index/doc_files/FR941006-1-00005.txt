in
1979
,
aphis
published
a
notice
of
proposed
action
(

,

)
to
restrict
animal
rabies
vaccines
to
distribution
and
use
by
or
under
the
direction
of
a
licensed
veterinarian
.
aphis
received
150
comments
in
response
to
that
notice
of
proposed
action
.
sixtysix
sixty
six
commenters
supported
the
proposed
action
without
change
.
seventytwo
seventy
two
commenters
were
opposed
to
the
proposed
action
.
at
that
time
,
there
was
a
lack
of
agreement
concerning
the
need
and
justification
for
a
federal
restriction
.
the
prevailing
opinion
of
those
opposed
to
a
federal
restriction
was
that
there
was
a
need
for
flexibility
to
meet
local
needs
,
especially
in
rural
areas
.
based
on
the
comments
received
in
1979
,
the
restriction
that
animal
rabies
vaccine
be
distributed
and
used
by
or
under
the
direction
of
a
veterinarian
was
not
imposed
on
a
nationwide
basis
.
rather
,
aphis
determined
that
the
decision
concerning
control
of
distribution
and
use
of
animal
rabies
vaccines
should
be
made
by
each
state
based
on
what
would
work
best
for
a
particular
state
.
thus
the
current
restriction
reads
in
relevant
part
that
animal
rabies
vaccines
are
restricted
`
to
authorized
recipients
designated
by
proper
state
officials
under
such
additional
conditions
as
those
authorities
may
require

at
least
34
states
currently
restrict
or
have
pending
legislation
to
restrict
the
distribution
and
use
of
animal
rabies
vaccines
.
some
sixteen
states
do
not
restrict
the
distribution
and
use
of
animal
rabies
vaccines
.
the
national
association
of
state
public
health
veterinarians
(
nasphv
,
the
american
veterinary
medical
association
(
avma
,
and
other
organizations
including
state
public
health
agencies
have
expressed
concern
regarding
rabies
control
programs
in
various
states
.
they
requested
in
1989
that
aphis
consider
the
promulgation
of
a
federal
restriction
on
the
distribution
and
use
of
animal
rabies
vaccines
on
a
nationwide
basis
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
animals
and
the
public
.
the
groups
that
took
an
active
role
in
studying
the
various
problems
associated
with
the
control
of
rabies
were
the
nasphv
compendium
committee
,
the
national
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
,
the
avma
,
state
and
local
veterinary
medical
associations
,
veterinary
medical
schools
,
veterinary
practitioners
,
and
numerous
state
public
health
agencies
.
the
nasphv
evaluated
the
progress
of
rabies
control
programs
in
the
united
states
.
as
a
result
of
its
study
,
nasphv
requested
that
the
federal
government
consider
strengthening
current
restrictions
aimed
toward
controlling
rabies
nationwide
.
in
response
to
the
request
from
the
nasphv
to
amend
the
federal
restriction
on
animal
rabies
vaccines
to
require
that
they
be
distributed
and
used
only
by
or
under
the
direct
supervision
of
a
licensed
veterinarians
,
aphis
requested
that
the
nasphv
address
four
issues
raised
by
the
comments
to
the
1979
notice
of
proposed
action
concerning
restrictions
on
animal
rabies
vaccines
.
four
main
points
were
cited
by
commenters
opposing
the
1979
proposed
restriction
that
rabies
vaccines
be
distributed
and
used
only
by
or
under
the
direction
of
a
veterinarian
:
(
1
)
there
were
inadequate
veterinary
services
in
remote
rural
areas
of
the
united
states
;
(
2
)
a
veterinary
monopoly
on
rabies
vaccine
would
raise
the
cost
of
vaccination
to
unaffordable
amounts
(
especially
for
individuals
with
many
animals
,
resulting
in
fewer
animals
being
vaccinated
;
(
3
)
traveling
to
and
from
a
veterinary
clinic
during
business
hours
(
especially
for
individuals
with
many
animals
)
could
be
very
inconvenient
and
impractical
;
and
(

)
aphis
has
no
information
whether
misuse
of
rabies
vaccines
by
nonveterinarians
is
a
problem
.
