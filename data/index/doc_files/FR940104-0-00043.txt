has
previously

concern

winter

chinook
salmon
may
be
adversely
impacted
by
the
disposal
of
contaminated
dredge
sediments
at
disposal
sites
located
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
.
the
residence
time
for
outmigrating
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
through
the
bay
is
thought
to
range
from
1
week
to
more
than
2
months
depending
on
the
water
year
type
.
prey
organisms
utilized
by
juvenile
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
may
bioaccumulate
contaminants
originating
from
inbay
in
bay
disposal
of
contaminated
dredge
sediments
,
thereby
exposing
juveniles
to
these
contaminants
as
they
forage
and
migrate
through
the
bay
.
although
nmfs
continues
to
be
concerned
about
the
potential
effects
of
inbay
in
bay
disposal
,
the
corps
has
taken
recent
action
to
ensure
that
inbay
in
bay
disposal
of
contaminated
materials
does
not
occur
.
in
06/19/1992
,
the
corps
,
epa
,
the
regional
water
quality
control
board
,
and
the
san
francisco
bay
conservation
and
development
commission
published
proposed
interim
testing
guidelines
for
dredged
sediments
that
would
be
disposed
of
at
inbay
in
bay
sites
.
on
02/01/1993
,
the
corps
formally
adopted
these
guidelines
in
public
notice
932
.
these
interim
testing
guidelines
are
designed
to
ensure
that
sufficient
information
is
available
to
characterize
sediments
to
be
dredged
for
all
projects
so
that
disposal
does
not
result
in
chemical
or
biological
degradation
of
the
disposal
site
.
these
guidelines
are
intended
to
apply
to
all
open
water
disposal
projects
until
a
longterm
long
term
plan
for
managing
dredged
sediments
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
is
developed
and
implemented
.
although
the
interim
testing
guidelines
adopted
by
the
corps
represent
an
important
shortterm
short
term
action
aimed
at
preventing
the
inbay
in
bay
disposal
of
contaminated
sediments
,
nmfs
believes
it
is
essential
that
a
longterm
long
term
strategy
be
developed
and
implemented
for
san
francisco
bay
area
dredging
and
disposal
activities
.
to
meet
this
need
,
the
corps
and
several
other
federal
,
state
and
local
agencies
,
including
nmfs
,
are
developing
a
longterm
long
term
management
strategy
(
ltms
)
for
managing
dredging
and
disposal
activities
.
the
ltms
is
designed
to
provide
appropriate
dredged
material
disposal
alternatives
for
a
50year
year
planning
horizon
through
the
designation
of
ocean
,
inbay
in
bay
,
and
upland
disposal
sites
and
the
identification
of
beneficial
reuse
options
.
implementation
of
the
ltms
management
programs
is
anticipated
to
begin
in
08/19/1994
.

bank

in

sacramento
river
are
believed
to
adversely
affect

rearing
habitat
.
the
corp
of
engineers
has
developed
the
sacramento
river
bank
protection
project
as
a
longrange
long
range
program
for
construction
of
bank
erosion
control
works
.
on
10/28/1991
,
nmfs
issued
a
biological
opinion
to
the
corps
that
concluded
phase
ii
of
the
project
was
not
likely
to
jeopardize
the
continued
existence
of
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
.
however
,
the
incidental
take
statement
issued
with
the
opinion
requires
the
corps
to
select
the
least
damaging
bank
stabilization
methods
available
and
to
provide
nmfs
with
detailed
mitigation
plans
for
each
bank
protection
project
in
phase
ii
that
would
adversely
affect
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
habitat
.
based
on
recent
information
developed
by
the
fws
concerning
bank
protection
methods
that
minimize
impacts
and
the
importance
of
protecting
shaded
riverine
aquatic
habitat
,
nmfs
requested
the
corps
to
reinitiate
consultation
on
phase
ii
of
the
project
in
late
1992
.
the
corps
is
currently
developing
additional
environmental
documentation
for
the
remaining
phase
ii
bank
protection
projects
,
and
nmfs
anticipates
that
further
consultation
will
be
initiated
when
that
documentation
is
completed
.
