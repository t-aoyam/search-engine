background
:
based
on
a
recent
review
of
the
literature
,
it
has
become
evident
that
in
the
homes
where
the
woman
is
battered
the
children
were
themselves
more
likely
to
be
victims
of
child
abuse
and
neglect
.
domestic
violence
is
surfacing
as
one
of
the
highest
risks
to
children
.
domestic
violence
represents
physical
endangerment
to
the
child
as
well
as
the
possibility
for
developmental
delay
.
in
1985
,
there
were
an
estimated
795000
abused
children
between
the
ages
of
3
and
17
living
in
twoparent
two
parent
households
(
gelles
,
strauss
,
1987
.
according
to
these
studies
,
men
are
the
main
perpetrators
of
domestic
violence
and
commit
95
percent
of
all
assaults
on
women
.
in
70
percent
of
households
in
which
women
are
abused
,
the
men
also
commit
child
abuse
(
schecter
,
1982
.
also
,
in
70
percent
of
child
abuse
cases
treated
at
boston
childrens
hospital
in
1991
,
the
mother
was
abused
as
well
.
in
an
attempt
to
establish
the
actual
relationship
between
child
abuse
and
battering
in
families
,
116
mothers
of
children
`
darted
'
or
flagged
in
a
single
year
for
abuse
or
neglect
at
a
metropolitan
hospital
were
studied
by
stark
and
flitcraft
(
1984
.
these
examinations
revealed
that
45
percent
of
the
abused
children
had
mothers
who
themselves
were
being
physically
abused
and
another
5
percent
had
mothers
whose
relationships
were
`
full
of
conflict
'
although
abuse
was
not
verified
.
bowker
,
arbitell
and
mcferron
(
1988
)
reported
that
children
whose
mothers
had
been
battered
were
more
likely
to
be
physically
abused
and
less
likely
to
be
`
neglected
'
than
children
whose
mothers
had
not
been
battered
.
in
hilberman
and
munsons
(
1987
)
research
,
they
found
evidence
of
physical
and
or
sexual
abuse
of
children
in
20
of
the
60
cases
they
studied
.
they
concluded
:
`
there
seems
to
be
two
styles
of
abuse
:
the
husband
beats
the
wife
who
beats
the
children
,
and
or
the
husband
beats
both
his
wife
and
children
