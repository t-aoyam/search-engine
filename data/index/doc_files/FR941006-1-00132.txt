fda
also
recognizes
that
the
warning
needs
to
be
crafted
to
reflect
the
type
of
packaging
used
.
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
may
be
packaged
in

unit
dose
packages
,
eg
,
blister
packs
,
or
in
containers
with
closures
,
eg
,
a
bottle
with
a
cap
.
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
for
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
packaged
in
unitdose
unit
dose
packages
,
the
warning
statement
should
include
the
instruction
`
keep
in
original
package
until
each
use
'
this
statement
instructs
the
user
not
to
misuse
the
product
by
removing
more
dosage
units
from
their
individual
packs
than
will
be
ingested
at
one
time
.
this
instruction
is
important
because
such
misuse
can
result
in
poisoning
if
children
gain
access
to
the
dosage
units
that
have
been
removed
from
their
original
packaging
.
this
instruction
was
not
specifically
requested
by
any
of
the
petitions
.
because
some
incidents
of
pediatric
iron
poisoning
have
occurred
after
adults
removed
multiple
dosage
units
from
their
original
containers
and
stored
them
in
nonchildresistant
nonchild
resistant
vessels
(
see
section
ic
.
of
this
document
,
however
,
the
agency
tentatively
concludes
that
this
statement
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
product
is
properly
used
.
the
agency
concurs
with
the
ndma
petition
that
the
statement
`
close
tightly
'
should
be
included
in
the
warning
statement
for
containers
with
closures
.
such
a
statement
provides
information
on
how
to
maintain
the
childresistance
child
resistance
of
the
container
.
fda
finds
that
this
message
is
a
material
fact
.
fda
bases
this
finding
,
in
part
,
on
the
fact
that
some
incidents
of
iron
poisoning
have
occurred
even
though
the
product
was
in
childresistant
child
resistant
packaging
.
children
were
able
to
gain
access
to
iron
products
because
the
childresistant
child
resistant
closure
was
not
properly
secured
(
see
section
ic
.
of
this
document
.
thus
,
to
ensure
that
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
are
used
safely
,
the
childresistance
child
resistance
of
the
packaging
must
be
maintained
,
and
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
inclusion
of
the
statement
`
close
tightly
'
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
condition
of
use
is
maintained
.
fda
also
tentatively
concludes
that
the
label
must
include
the
information
`
contains
iron
,
which
can
harm
or
cause
death
to
a
child
'
this

informs
the

nature
of
the

that
