dilution
ventilation
offers
no
protection
in
those
cases
where
,
due
to
the
close
proximity
to
a
smoker
(
eg
,
contaminant
point
source
,
the
nonsmoking
employee
may
be
exposed
to
large
amounts
of
sidestream
smoke
and
exhaled
mainstream
smoke
(
ets
.
due
to
the
limitations
of
general
ventilation
,
the
smoke
cannot
be
removed
from
the
air
before
reaching
the
breathing
zone
of
nearby
employees
.
the
carcinogenicity
of
ets
discounts
the
use
of
general
ventilation
as
an
engineering
control
for
this
contaminant
.
the
major
ventilation
guidance
document
available
to
hvac
practioners
(
eg
,
designers
,
maintenance
,
and
operators
,
is
standard
621989
titled
`
ventilation
for
acceptable
indoor
air
quality
'
[
ex
.
4333
.
the
standard
is
published
by
the
american
society
of
heating
,
refrigerating
and
airconditioning
air
conditioning
engineers
,
inc
.
(
ashrae
)
and
it
specifies
recommended
minimum
design
outside
air
ventilation
rates
for
91
different
applications
.
based
on
this
current
ventilation
standard
,
a
typical
commercial
hvac
system
serving
general
office
space
should
prescriptively
deliver
20
cubic
feet
per
minute
per
person
(
cfm
person
)
of
outside
air
to
the
occupied
space
to
dilute
occupant
generated
contaminants
like
carbon
dioxide
(
co
)
)
and
body
odors
.
this
ventilation
rate
would
provide
what
ashrae
defines
as
`
acceptable
indoor
air
quality
'
(
eg
,
sensory
comfort
)
to
satisfy
at
least
80
%
of
the
building
occupants
.
the
prescribed
ventilation
rates
in
ashrae
standard
621989
are
proportional
to
the
occupants
in
the
space
(
eg
,
cfm
per
person
)
because
of
the
presumption
that
the
contamination
produced
is
in
proportion
to
the
occupant
density
.
the
foreword
of
ashrae
standard
621989
states
`
with
respect
to
tobacco
smoke
and
other
contaminants
,
this
standard
does
not
,
and
cannot
,
ensure
the
avoidance
of
all
possible
adverse
health
effects
,
but
it
reflects
recognized
consensus
criteria
and
guidance
'
as
published
,
ashrae
standard
621989
did
not
include
any
summary
and
or
explanation
documentation
which
would
explain
the
basis
of
the
consensus
standard
.
without
this
documentation
,
it
can
only
be
inferred
that
the
standard
was
mostly
based
on
satisfaction
of
sensory
comfort
rather
than
based
on
the
control
of
contaminants
like
ets
which
may
contribute
to
adverse
health
effects
like
lung
cancer
and
heart
disease
.
the
method
of
room
air
distribution
found
in
most
hvac
systems
is
a
mixing
system
that
attempts
to
create
an
environment
of
uniform
air
velocities
,
temperatures
and
humidities
in
the
occupied
zone
of
a
room
(
eg
;
floor
to
6
feet
above
floor
.
in
this
occupied
zone
,
air
velocities
less
than
50
feet
per
minute
(
fpm
)
and
minimization
of
temperature
gradients
will
promote
occupant
comfort
.
in
a
conventional
mixing
system
where
the
supply
air
diffusers
(
outlets
)
and
the
return
air
grilles
are
both
located
in
the
ceiling
,
the
air
motion
in
the
occupied
zone
could
be
characterized
as
`
gentle
drift
'
toward
the
ceiling
where
the
room
air
is
then
mixed
with
the
conditioned
air
being
delivered
to
the
room
through
the
supply
air
diffusers
[
1993
ashrae
handbook
,
ch

.
because
of
natural
convection
currents
and
thermal
buoyancy
forces
it
is
common
,
especially
during
heating
season
,
to
have
stagnant
zones
.
in
a
mixing
room
air
distribution
system
,
the
emphasis
is
on
comfort
.
there
are
other
room
air
distribution
schemes
which
consider
contaminant
control
and
have
been
used
in
the
industrial
environment
like
displacement
ventilation
and
unidirectional
(
plugflow
plug
flow
)
airflow
ventilation
.
in
these
schemes
,
there
is
an
attempt
to
move
contaminants
directionally
along
a
clean
to
less
clean
gradient
.
these
schemes
are
seldom
used
in
conventional
hvac
systems
due
to
their
cost
,
feasibility
and
compromise
of
comfort
issues
.
from
the
industrial
hygiene
perspective
,
local
exhaust
ventilation
,
specific
to
each
source
,
would
be
the
preferred
and
recommended
method
for
controlling
occupational
exposures
to
contaminant
point
sources
like
ets
.
such
specific
ventilation
is
effective
because
the
contaminant
is
captured
or
contained
at
its
source
before
it
is
dispersed
into
the
work
environment
where
only
ineffective
general
dilution
ventilation
is
available
to
control
exposures
.
a
designated
smoking
area
which
is
enclosed
,
exhausted
directly
to
the
outside
,
and
maintained
under
negative
pressure
is
sufficient
to
contain
tobacco
smoke
within
the
designated
area
.
such
areas
could
be
considered
an
application
of
local
exhaust
ventilation
because
the
contaminant
is
being
exhausted
from
a
confined
source
without
dispersal
into
the
general
workspace
.
iv
.
preliminary
quantitative
risk
assessment
a
.
introduction
the
determining
factor
in
the
decision
to
perform
a
quantitative
risk
assessment
is
the
availability
of
suitable
data
for
use
in
such
an
assessment
.
a
wide
spectrum
of
health
effects
have
been
associated
with
exposure
to
indoor
air
pollutants
and
ets
.
these
effects
range
from
acute
irritant
effects
to
cancer
.
in
the
case
of
ets
,
osha
has
determined
that
data
are
available
to
quantify
two
types
of
risk
:
lung
cancer
and
heart
disease
.
for
this
risk
assessment
,
osha
defines
`
heart
disease
'
to
be
coronary
heart
disease
excluding
strokes
,
as
defined
in
the
framingham
study
[
ex
.
4108
.
in
the
case
of
indoor
air
pollutants
,
the
only
data
available
to
osha
were
on
specific
acute
health
effects
,
such
as
severe
headaches
,
excluding
migraines
,
and
other
respiratory
conditions
,
such
as
`
stuffy
nose
,
`
runny
nose
,
etc
.
osha
is
aware
that
there
are
more
serious
conditions
such
as
legionellosis
and
hypersensitivity
diseases
associated
with
poor
indoor
air
and
suspected
to
be
potential
occupational
hazards
.
however
,
the
agency
currently
does
not
have
adequate
data
to
conduct
a
quantitative
risk
assessment
addressing
these
risks
in
the
workplace
.
osha
is
continuing
to
develop
appropriate
methodology
to
address
risk
estimations
for
conditions
related
to
poor
indoor
air
quality
in
the
workplace
and
is
requesting
input
on
data
sources
relevant
to
these
efforts
.
