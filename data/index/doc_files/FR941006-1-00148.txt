regulatory
options
there
are
many
possible
regulatory
alternatives
available
that
may
reduce
the
number
of
cases
of
pediatric
poisonings
from
the
accidental
ingestion
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
.
the
options
include
packaging
,
warning
statements
,
product
reformulation
,
and
educational
efforts
.
1
.
packaging
one
regulatory
option
available
to
fda
is
to
require
that
products
containing
iron
be
packaged
in
unitdose
unit
dose
containers
.
because
of
the
cpsc
regulations
,
most
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
currently
must
be
packaged
in
crcs
.
therefore
,
the
effect
of
this
option
would
be
to
require
child
resistant
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
for
most
of
these
products
.
fda
could
require
unit
-
dose
packaging
for
all
products
or
for
only
higher
dosage
products
.
for
comparison
,
fda
will
consider
potencies
of
30
mg
,
40
mg
,
and
60
mg
as
the
minimum
potencies
per
dosage
unit
of
iron
that
would
trigger
unitdosage
unit
dosage
packaging
.
a
.
costs
.
there
are
four
types
of
costs
associated
with
a
mandated
packaging
change
:
equipment
,
materials
,
transportation
,
and
administrative
costs
.
if
this
option
is
selected
,
many
packagers
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
will
be
required
to
purchase
new
packaging
equipment
.
the
cost
of
equipment
used
in
packaging
blisters
,
one
common
form
of
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
,
is
between
$
50000
and
$
250000
,
or
on
average
$
132500
.
new
equipment
will
not
be
purchased
for
each
product
sold
because
some
manufacturers
already
possess
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
equipment
.
the
cost
of
childresistant
child
resistant
bottles
,
currently
the
most
common
form
of
packaging
,
is
approximately
$
7
per
1000
dosage
units
.
childresistant
child
resistant
blisters
cost
approximately
$
9
per
1000
dosage
units
,
a
difference
of
$
2
per
1000
dosage
units
.
fda
does
not
have
information
to
estimate
additional
transportation
costs
caused
by
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
requirements
and
requests
comments
on
increased
transportation
costs
.
additionally
,
firms
are
expected
to
incur
administrative
costs
of
approximately
$
500
per
product
in
the
first
year
.
administrative
costs
are
the
dollar
value
of
the
incremental
administrative
effort
expended
in
order
to
comply
with
a
regulation
.
administrative
activities
include
,
but
are
not
limited
to
,
identifying
the
underlying
policy
of
the
regulation
,
interpreting
that
policy
relative
to
the
firms
products
,
establishing
a
corporate
position
,
formulating
a
method
for
compliance
,
and
managing
the
compliance
effort
