decision
,
the
supreme
court
indicated
when
a
reasonable
person
might
consider
the
risk
significant
and
take
steps
to
decrease
it
.
the
court
stated
:
it
is
the
agencys
responsibility
to
determine
in
the
first
instance
what
it
considers
to
be
a
`
significant
'
risk
.
some
risks
are
plainly
acceptable
and
others
are
plainly
unacceptable
.
if
,
for
example
,
the
odds
are
one
in
a
billion
that
a
person
will
die
from
cancer
by
taking
a
drink
of
chlorinated
water
,
the
risk
clearly
could
not
be
considered
significant
.
on
the
other
hand
,
if
the
odds
are
one
in
a
thousand
that
regular
inhalation
of
gasoline
vapors
that
are
2
%
benzene
will
be
fatal
,
a
reasonable
person
might
well
consider
the
risk
significant
and
take
the
appropriate
steps
to
decrease
or
eliminate
it
.

two
of
the
adverse
health
effects
associated
with

to

are
lung
cancer
and
heart
disease
(
coronary
heart
disease
,
excluding
strokes
.
clinically
,
lung
cancer
is
almost
always
fatal
.
however
,
heart
disease
runs
the
gamut
from
severe
to
disabling
to
fatal
.
both
of
these
diseases
then
constitute
the
type
of
`
material
impairment
of
health
or
functional
capacity
'
which
the
act
seeks
to
reduce
or
eliminate
.
therefore
a
standard
aimed
at
reducing
the
incidence
of
these
impairments
is
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
secretarys
regulatory
authority
.
in
the
case
before
us
the
agency
estimates
that
there
will
be
approximately
between
144
and
722
cases
of
lung
cancer
per
year
among
nonsmoking
american
workers
exposed
to
ets
in
the
workplace
.
when
considered
over
a
working
lifetime
,
this
translates
into
an
excess
lung
cancer
rate
in
the
workplace
of
one
per
thousand
.
as
noted
above
,
the
benzene
court
clearly
indicated
that
a
risk
of
one
in
a
thousand
could
be
considered
significant
and
that
the
agency
would
be
justified
in
prescribing
reasonable
efforts
to
reduce
such
a
risk
.
therefore
,
the
risk
from
lung
cancer
associated
with
worker
exposure
to
ets
in
the
workplace
meets
the
benzene
courts
characterization
of
what
could
be
considered
significant
.
in
addition
,
in
evaluating
the
significance
of
the
risk
posed
by
any
particular
workplace
hazard
,
the
secretary
is
entitled
to
take
into
consideration
not
only
the
rate
of
risk
but
the
total
number
of
workers
exposed
to
such
risk
and
the
absolute
magnitude
of
effects
.
in
this
case
,
evidence
in
the
record
shows
that
approximately
between
144
and
722
lung
cancer
deaths
per
year
are
attributable
to
ets
and
that
there
are
presently
over
74
million
nonsmoking
american
workers
exposed
to
ets
in
their
places
of
employment
.
on
the
basis
of
these
data
,
it
would
also
be
reasonable
to
conclude
that
agency
action
is
warranted
to
reduce
this
widespread
and
significant
risk
,
although
the
agency
would
reach
this
conclusion
even
without
the
great
magnitude
of
effects
.
as
noted
above
,
cancer
is
not
the
only
serious
adverse
health
effect
associated
with
exposure
to
ets
.
preliminary
estimates
indicate
that
the
risk
of
mortality
from
heart
disease
due
to
ets
exposure
is
even
greater
than
that
of
cancer
.
the
agency
estimates
that
there
will
be
between
2094
and
13000
deaths
from
heart
disease
per
year
among
nonsmoking
american
workers
exposed
to
ets
in
the
workplace
.
when
considered
over
a
working
lifetime
,
this
translates
into
an
excess
death
rate
of
approximately
between
7
and
16
cases
of
heart
disease
per
thousand
attributed
to
workplace
exposure
to
ets
.
clearly
,
this
risk
is
significant
in
itself
and
combined
with
the
lung
cancer
risk
,
the
significance
of
risk
is
very
great
.
the
proposal
seeks
to
protect
nonsmoking
employees
from
the
hazards
of
exposure
to
ets
in
the
workplace
.
it
does
this
by
prescribing
the
conditions
under
which
employees
would
be
allowed
to
smoke
in
the
workplace
,
that
is
,
only
in
separately
enclosed
designated
areas
which
are
separately
ventilated
.
no
employee
can
be
required
to
work
in
an
area
where
there
will
be
contamination
from
ets
.
this
in
oshas
view
reduces
significant
risk
to
only
a
small
percentage
of
the
current
risk
.
to
the
extent
that
there
are
failures
of
enforcement
of
the
smoking
limitation
and
of
the
ventilation
system
,
the
risk
will
not
be
totally
eliminated
.
since
there
is
no
definition
of
,
nor
an
established
method
for
quantifying
,
exposure
,
it
is
not
possible
to
determine
a
`
dose
limit
'
that
would
eliminate
significant
risk
.
even
if
that
were
possible
,
it
is
not
clear
it
would
be
the
correct
policy
approach
.

for

,
involving
many
different
types
of
health

and

accordingly

the
