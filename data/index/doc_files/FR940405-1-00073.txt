most
published
risk
assessments
are
based
on
spousal
exposure
to
ets
.
these
studies
have
examined
the
lung
cancer
risk
in
nonsmoking
housewives
,
using
spousal
smoking
as
a
surrogate
for
the
wifes
exposure
to
ets
.
the
size
of
the
association
between
these
health
effects
and
ets
exposure
in
the
workplace
is
expected
to
be
at
least
as
large
as
the
association
seen
between
these
health
effects
and
ets
exposure
in
residential
settings
or
public
places
.
as
noted
by
meridian
research
in
their
1988
report
,
`
.
.
.
.
.
it
is
the
exposure
to
environmental
tobacco
smoke
,
and
not
the
environment
in
which
that
exposure
occurs
,
that
is
the
important
risk
factor
'
[

.
therefore
,
health
effects
observed
and
the
risk
estimates
calculated
from
studies
of
the
general
population
,
or
of
selected
subgroups
,
such
as
nonsmoking
wives
of
smoking
husbands
,
are
relevant
to
the
working
nonsmoking
population
.
