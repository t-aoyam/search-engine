the
commission
believes
that
the
nasds
proposal
is
an
instructive
step
and
will
provide
useful
comment
from
the
member
firm
community
.
the
commission
,
however
,
believes
that
comment
from
the
broader
constituency
of
the
investing
public
and
other
nonnasd
nasd
members
will
be
critical
in
formulating
adequate
limit
order
protection
for
the
nasdaq
market
.
in
addition
,
the
commission
believes
that
alternatives
which
provide
more
extensive
limit
order
protection
for
public
customers
also
should
be
the
subject
of
public
comment
.
therefore
,
the
commission
has
determined
to
propose
its
own
rule
.
publication
of
the
proposal
will
complement
the
efforts
of
the

and
enable
the

to
act
on
its
own

such
action
appropriate
