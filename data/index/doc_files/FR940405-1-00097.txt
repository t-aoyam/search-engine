based
on
the
above
evidence
,
osha
has
concluded
that
the
private
market
has
failed
to
provide
optimal
levels
of
safety
to
employees
.
consequently
,
some
form
of
intervention
that
fosters
safer
work
environments
must
be
used
to
reduce
occupational
exposure
.
because
such
intervention
need
not
occur
through
government
regulation
,
osha
has
considered
the
effectiveness
of
other
nonregulatory
regulatory
options
:
(

)
relying
on
tort
litigation
and
(
2
)
relying
on
workers
'
compensation
programs
.
(

tort
liability
.
the
use
of
liability
under
tort
law
is
one
nonregulatory
alternative
that
has
been
increasingly
used
in
litigation
concerning
occupationally
related
illnesses
.
prosser
[
ex
.
4256

describes
a
tort
,
in
part
,
as
a
`
civil
wrong
,
other
than
a
breach
of
contract
,
for
which
the
court
will
provide
a
remedy
in
the
form
of
an
action
for
damages
.
if
the
tort
system
applies
,
it
would
allow
a
worker
whose
health
has
been
adversely
affected
by
occupational
exposure
to
a
hazardous
substance
to
sue
and
recover
damages
from
the
employer
.
thus
,
if
the
tort
system
is
effectively
applied
,
it
might
shift
the
liability
of
direct
costs
of
occupational
disease
from
the
worker
to
the
firm
under
certain
specific
circumstances
.
with
very
limited
exceptions
,
however
,
the
tort
system
is
not
a
viable
alternative
in
dealings
between
employees
and
employers
.
all
states
have
legislation
providing
that
workers
'
compensation
is
either
the
exclusive
or
principal
remedy
available
to
employees
against
their
employers
.
thus
,
under
tort
law
,
workers
with
an
occupational
disease
caused
by
exposure
to
a
hazardous
substance
can
only
file
a
product
liability
suit
against
a
third
party
manufacturer
,
processor
,
distributor
,
sales
firm
,
or
contractor
.
it
is
often
difficult
,
however
,
to
demonstrate
a
direct
link
between
an
exposure
to
a
hazardous
substance
and
the
illness
.
in
order
to
pursue
litigation
successfully
,
there
must
be
specific
knowledge
of
the
magnitude
and
duration
of
a
workers
exposure
to
a
hazardous
substance
,
as
well
as
the
causal
link
between
the
disease
and
the
occupational
exposure
.
usually
,
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
isolate
the
role
of
occupational
exposures
in
causing
the
disease
,
especially
if
workers
are
exposed
to
many
toxic
substances
and
the
exposure
is
not
necessarily
limited
to
the
workplace
such
as
the
case
for
ets
.
this
difficulty
is
further
compounded
by
the
long
latency
periods
that
are
frequently
involved
.
in
addition
,
the
liable
party
must
be
identifiable
,
but
workers
may
have
several
employers
over
a
working
lifetime
.
the
burden
of
proof
that
an
occupational
exposure
to
a
hazardous
substance
occurred
,
that
a
specific
employer
is
the
liable
party
,
and
that
the
exposure
level
was
significant
may
prohibit
the
individual
from
initiating
the
suit
.
there
are
an
increasing
number
of
lawsuits
that
are
related
to
health
effects
to
building
occupants
from
poor
indoor
air
quality
.
these
lawsuits
are
typically
filed
after
the
illness
or
health
effect
has
been
diagnosed
.
in
this
sense
,
increasing
pressure
is
being
placed
on
businesses
.
however
,
the
legal
pressure
currently
does
not
relate
to
the
implementation
of
a
clean
indoor
air
policy
(
eg
,
legal
action
is
not
currently
being
taken
just
because
a
company
does
not
have
a
clean
indoor
air
policy
.
these
actions
are
event
related
as
opposed
to
being
policy
related
.
iaq
litigation
is
growing
rapidly
and
the
focus
is
shifting
from
residential
to
commercial
facilities

legal
proceedings
do
not
internalize
occupational
illness
costs
because
they
involve
substantial
legal
fees
associated
with
bringing
about
court
action
.
in
deciding
whether
to
sue
,
the
tort
victim
must
be
sure
that
the
size
of
the
claim
will
be
large
enough
to
cover
legal
expenses
.
in
effect
,
the
plaintiff
is
likely
to
face
substantial
transaction
costs
in
the
form
of
a
contingency
fee
,
commonly
33
percent
,
plus
additional
legal
expenses
.
the
accused
firm
must
also
pay
for
its
defense
.
the
high
costs
and
uncertainties
associated
with
tort
law
make
it
an
inefficient
mechanism
for
ensuring
adequate
protection
of
workers
'
health
.
insurance
and
liability
costs
are
not
borne
in
full
by
the
specific
employer
responsible
for
the
risk
involved
.
for
firms
that
are
insured
,
the
premium
determination
process
is
such
that
premiums
only
partially
reflect
changes
in
risk
associated
with
changes
in
exposure
to
hazardous
substances
.
this
lack
of
complete
adjustment
is
the
socalled
so
called
`
moral
hazard
'
problem
,
which
is
the
risk
that
arises
from
the
possible
imprudence
of
the
insured
.
as
the
insured
firm
has
paid
an
insurance
company
to
assume
some
of
the
risks
,
that
firm
has
less
reason
to
exercise
the
diligence
necessary
to
avoid
losses
.
transfer
of
risk
is
a
fundamental
source
of
imperfection
in
markets
.
there
is
a
growing
number
of
state
and
local
laws
and
ordinances
controlling
smoking
.
armed
with
new
data
that
show
health
effects
from
indoor
air
pollutants
,
plaintiffs
who
believe
that
they
have
been
injured
by
the
air
inside
their
workplaces
are
beginning
to
take
the
offensive
.
they
are
lobbying
on
the
local
,
state
and
federal
levels
for
protective
legislation
,
and
in
the
absence
of
such
legislation
,
they
are
suing
for
damages
to
their
health
.
these
cases
are
complex
not
only
in
the
nature
of
the
technical
proof
that
must
be
developed
and
presented
,
but
also
in
the
number
of
parties
involved
.
suits
have
been
filed
against
architects
,
builders
,
contractors
,
building
product
manufacturers
and
