the

has
observed
that
these
three
elements
(
ie
,
offsetting
growth
in

,
attainment
of
the
rfp
reduction
,
and
attainment
of
the

(

create
a
timing
problem
of
which
congress
was
perhaps
not
fully
aware

submit

that
show

not

post1996

of

.
the
sip
demonstrations
due
on
11/15/1993
,
and
on
november
15
,
1994
,
are
broader
in
scope
than
growth
in
vmt
or
trips
in
that
they
necessarily
address
emission

for
non

and
,
in
the
case
of

.
the
usepa
does
not
believe
that
congress
intended
the
vmt
offset
provision
to
advance
the
dates
for
these
broader
submissions
.
further
,
usepa
believes
that
the
11/15/1992
,
date
would
not
allow
sufficient
time
for
states
to
have
fully
developed
specific
sets
of
measures
that
would
comply
with
all
of
the
elements
of
the
vmt
offset
requirements
of
section
182d1a
)
over
the
long
term
.
consequently
,
usepa
believes
it
would
be
appropriate
to
interpret
the
act
to
provide
the
following
alternative
set
of
staged
deadlines
for
submittal
of
elements
of
the
vmt
offset
sip
.
under
this
interpretation
,
the
three
required
elements
of
section
182d1a
)
are
separable
,
and
can
be
divided
into
three
separate
submissions
that
could
be
submitted
on
different
dates
.
section
179a
)
of
the
act
,
in
establishing
how
usepa
would
be
required
to
apply
mandatory
sanctions
if
a
state
fails
to
submit
a
full
sip
also
provides
that
the
sanctions
clock
starts
if
a
state
fails
to
submit
one
or
more
sip
elements
,
as
determined
by
the
administrator
.
the
usepa
believes
that
this
language
provides
the
agency
the
authority
to
determine
that
the
different
elements
of
a
sip
submission
are
separable
.
moreover
,
given
the
continued
timing
problems
addressed
above
,
usepa
believes
it
is
appropriate
to
allow
states
to
separate
the
vmt
offset
sip
into
three
elements
,
each
to
be
submitted
at
different
times
:
(
1
)
the
initial
requirement
to
submit
tcms
that
offset
growth
in
emissions
;
(
2
)
the
requirement
to
comply
with
the
15
%
periodic
reduction
requirement
of
the
act
;
and
,
(
3
)
the
requirement
to
comply
with
the
post1996
post
periodic
reduction
and
attainment
requirements
of
the
act
.
under
this
approach
,
the
first
element
,
the
emissions
offset
element
,
was
due
on
11/15/1992
.
the
usepa
believes
this
element
is
not
necessarily
dependent
on
the
development
of
the
other
elements
.
the
state
could
submit
the
emissions
growth
offset
element
independent
of
an
analysis
of
that
elements
consistency
with
the
periodic
reduction
and
attainment
requirements
of
the
act
.
emissions
trends
from
other
sources
need
not
be
considered
to
show
compliance
with
this
offset
requirement
.
as
submitting
this
element
in
isolation
does
not
implicate
the
timing
problem
of
advancing
deadlines
for
rfp
and
attainment
demonstrations
,
usepa
does
not
believe
it
is
necessary
to
extend
the
statutory
deadline
for
submittal
of
the
emissions
growth
offset
element
.
the
second
element
,
which
requires
the
vmt
offset
sip
to
comply
with
the
15
%
rfp
requirement
of
the
act
,
was
due
on
november
15
,
1993
,
which
is
the
same
date
on
which
the
15
%
rfp
sip
itself
was
due
under
section
182b1
)
of
the
act
.
the
usepa
believes
it
is
reasonable
to
extend
the
deadline
for
this
element
to
the
date
on
which
the
entire
15
%
sip
was
due
,
as
this
allows
states
to
develop
the
comprehensive
strategy
to
address
the
15
%
reduction
requirement
and
assure
that
the
tcm
elements
required
under
section
182d1a
)
are
consistent
with
the
remainder
of
the
15
%
demonstration
.
indeed
,
usepa
believes
that
only
upon
submittal
of
the
broader
15
%
plan
can
a
state
have
had
the
necessary
opportunity
to
coordinate
its
vmt
strategy
with
its
15
%
plan
.
the
third
element
,
which
requires
the
vmt
offset
sip
to
comply
with
the
post1996
post
rfp
and
attainment
requirements
of
the
act
,
will
be
due
on
11/15/1994
,
the
statutory
deadline
for
those
broader
submissions
.
the
usepa
believes
it
is
reasonable
to
extend
the
deadline
for
this
element
to
the
date
on
which
the
post1996
post
rfp
and
attainment
sips
are
due
for
the
same
reasons
it
is
reasonable
to
extend
the
deadline
for
the
second
element
.
first
,
it
is
arguably
impossible
for
a
state
to
make
the
showing
required
by
section
182d1a
)
for
the
third
element
until
the
broader
demonstrations
have
been
developed
by
the
state
.
moreover
,
allowing
states
to
develop
the
comprehensive
strategy
to
address
post1996
post
rfp
and
attainment
by
providing
a
fuller
opportunity
to
assure
that
the
tcm
elements
comply
with
the
broader
rfp
and
attainment
demonstrations
,
will
result
in
a
better
program
for
reducing
emissions
in
the
long
term
.
on

illinois
uses

.
the
illinois
15

sip
revision
request
is
not

the
usepa
is
proposing
to
approve
the
second
portion
of
the
vmt

submittal
after
final
tcm
commitments
are
submitted
and
usepa
makes
a
favorable
finding
of
completeness
on
the
illinois

illinois
will
submit
