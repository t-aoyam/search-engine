gsa
has
determined
that
this
rule
is
not
a
significant
rule
for
the
purposes
of
executive
order
12866
of
october
4
,
1993
,
because
it
is
not
likely
to
result
in
any
of
the
impacts
noted
in
executive
order
12866
,
affect
the
rights
of
specified
individuals
,
or
raise
issues
arising
from
the
policies
of
the
administration
.
gsa
has
based
all
administrative
decisions
underlying
this
rule
on
adequate
information
concerning
the
need
for
and
consequences
of
this
rule
;
has
determined
that
the
potential
benefits
to
society
from
this
rule
outweigh
the
potential
costs
;
has
maximized
the
net
benefits
;
and
has
chosen
the
alternative
approach
involving
the
least
net
cost
to
society
