given
this
situation
,
one
approach
would
be
to
wait
until
after
the
new
rules
and
procedures
have
been
in
place
for
an
entire
presidential
election
cycle
before
evaluating
what
additional
streamlining
methods
are
warranted
,
if
any
.
in
the
alternative
,
the
commission
welcomes
suggestions
for
further
streamlining
these
processes
,
and
seeks
comments
on
several
possible
changes
that
are
explained
below
.
the
commission
notes
that
it
is
important
to
ensure
that
whatever
streamlining
measures
are
adopted
do
not
adversely
affect
the
statutorily
required
audit
process
,
the
committees
'
due
process
rights
when
repayment
determinations
are
made
,
or
the
commissions
ability
to
effectively
conduct
subsequent
enforcement
actions
.
as
for
modifications
to
the
actual
audit
and
repayment
processes
,
the
commission
is
first
considering
whether
the
committees
oral
presentation
should
be
held
at
an
earlier
point
.
currently
a
committee
may
request
the
opportunity
to
make
an
oral
presentation
if
the
committee
submits
written
materials
disputing
the
initial
repayment
determination
contained
in
the
far
.
11
cfr
90072c3
,
90382c3
.
please
note
that
the
commission
is
not
considering
adding
a
second
hearing
to
the
audit
and
repayment
processes
,
but
only
whether
the
current
hearing
should
be
held
at
a
different
point
.
the
commission
recognizes
that
some
committees
might
prefer
to
make
this
presentation
earlier
in
the
process
.
moving
up
the
hearing
could
also
help
the
commission
resolve
issues
at
an
earlier
date
.
however
,
it
is
unclear
whether
advancing
the
hearing
would
in
and
of
itself
shorten
either
the
audit
or
repayment
process
.
the
commissions
experience
has
been
that
many
issues
are
resolved
or
narrowed
as
the
audit
progresses
and
the
amount
of
the
repayment
is
further
refined
.
hence
,
an
earlier
date
could
result
in
a
longer
,
less
manageable
hearing
on
more
issues
.
to
date
,
the
commission
has
averaged
only
five
oral
hearings
per
cycle
,
because
sufficient
issues
were
resolved
in
or
before
the
far
in
the
other
audits
to
make
a
hearing
unnecessary
.
the
earlier
in
the
process
a
hearing
is
held
,
the
more
likely
it
is
that
a
committee
will
request
one
.
this
approach
could
thus
slow
down
,
rather
than
speed
up
,
the
audit
process
.
the
commission
also
seeks
comments
on
whether
to
shorten
the
time
between
various
stages
of
the
audit
,
repayment
,
and
enforcement
processes
,
or
to
eliminate
some
of
these
stages
.
for
example
,
the
iar
currently
includes
a
preliminary
repayment
calculation
,
while
the
far
includes
an
initial
repayment
determination
.
11
cfr
90071c
,
(
d
;
90381c
,
(
d
.
the
commission
issues
the
final
repayment
determination
following
consideration
of
the
initial
repayment
determination
in
the
far
,
along
with
,
inter
alia
,
information
contained
in
the
committees
written
response
or
presented
at
the
hearing
,
if
one
is
held
.
11
cfr
90072c4
,
90382c4
.
one
alternative
would
be
to
include
the
initial
repayment
determination
in
the
iar
,
and
include
the
final
repayment
determination
and
statement
of
reasons
in
the
far
.
the
committee
would
then
respond
to
the
iar
with
a
written
statement
and
could
request
the
opportunity
to
make
an
oral
presentation
,
as
is
now
done
following
the
far
.
this
hearing
and
related
documentation
would
serve
as
the
basis
for
the
far
.
the
committee
would
continue
to
have
the
right
to
petition
for
a
rehearing
,
in
accordance
with
11
cfr
90075
and
90385
,
but
would
exercise
this
right
following
the
far
final
repayment
determination
,
rather
than
after
the
later
,
separatelyissued
separately
issued
final
repayment
determination
that
occurs
under
the
present
rules
.
please
note
that
including
the
initial
repayment
determination
in
the
iar
would
not
change
the
rule
that
issuance
of
an
iar
serves
as
notification
of
repayment
determinations
.
see
11
cfr
90072a2
)
and
90382a2
.
a
variation
of
this
approach
would
be
to
provide
a
staff
draft
of
the
iar
to
the
committee
at
the
same
time
it
is
sent
to
the
commission
,
much
in
the
manner
that
the
commission
currently
provides
a
probable
cause
to
believe
brief
to
respondents
pursuant
to
2
usc
.
437ga3
.
the
committee
could
provide
a
written
response
to
the
staffprepared
staff
prepared
iar
and
request
a
hearing
before
the
commission
.
the
hearing
and
additional
materials
submitted
would
serve
as
the
basis
for
the
commissions
adoption
of
the
far
.
the
commission
would
subsequently
issue
the
final
repayment
determination
and
statement
of
reasons
.
while
this
approach
could
take
less
time
,
committees
might
prefer
to
know
when
they
are
preparing
their
responses
whether
the
commission
agrees
with
the
staffs
analysis
of
the
issues
presented
.
this
would
not
be
possible
if
the
committee
received
the
staff
draft
of
the
iar
at
the
same
time
it
was
sent
to
the
commission
.
also
,
the
staff
draft
could
not
contain
an
interim
repayment
determination
,
as
that
must
be
approved
by
the
commission
.
the
commission
is
also
concerned
with
how
confidentiality
requirements
could
impact
on
these
proposed
revisions
.
when
committee
activities
raise
both
repayment
and
enforcement
issues
,
the
current
confidentiality
provisions
require
that
matters
already
determined
by
the
commission
to
warrant
enforcement
action
not
be
made
public
during
the
commissions
discussion
of
the
initial
repayment
determination
.
for
example
,
the
publicly
released
far
does
not
discuss
the
referral
of
specific
matters
for
enforcement
under
2
usc
.
437g
.
