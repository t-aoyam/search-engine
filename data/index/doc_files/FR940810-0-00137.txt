analysis
has
been
included
as
appendix

,
to
provide
a
suggested
uniform
method
for
the
identification
of
asbestos
.
this
method
uses
polarized

on

microscope
.
using
this
methodology
,
fibers
visible
in

can
be

to
assess
whether
there
might
be
potential
for
asbestos
exposure
from
a

which
can
be
measured
by

this

osha

in

as
a
result

therefore

there

under

the

to

those
