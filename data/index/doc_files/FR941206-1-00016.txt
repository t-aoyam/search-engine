the

proposing
to
amend
the

meat

inspection
regulations
to
define

establish
other
requirements

provisions
for
the
composition

such

requirements
for
manufacturing

the

would
prescribe
a

for
poultry

produced
by
mechanical

with
1

less

bone

fsis

prescribe
a

for
the
finely

poultry

resulting
from
the
mechanical

and
removal
of
most
of
the
bone
from
attached
skeletal
muscle

other
tissue
of
poultry
carcasses
and
parts
of

a

this

commonly
known
in
the
poultry
industry
as
mechanically
deboned
poultry

mdp

while
whole
carcasses
sometimes
are
used
,
the
starting
materials
for
this
type
of
processing
frequently
are
parts
of

,
such
as
frames
,
backs
and
necks
,
which
contain
relatively
low
proportions
of
skeletal
muscle
,
or
parts
,
such
as
breast
frames
,
from
which
most
of
the
skeletal
muscle
already
has
been
removed
by
traditional
deboning
techniques

the
starting
materials
,
which
may
have
undergone
an
initial
bone
breaking
process

are
pushed
under
high
pressure
through
equipment
with
apertures
that
allow
a
small
amount
of
powdered
bone
to
pass
through
with
the
soft

such
starting
material
is
in
natural
proportion

to

if
skin

is
in
excess
of

found
naturally

the
