in
1991
both
agencies
signed
a
memorandum
of
understanding
(
mou
)
to
share
information
which
will
aid
their
enforcement
efforts
.
pursuant
to
that
mou
,
osha
is
developing
with
epa
an
information
sharing
system
based
on
the
reports
submitted
both
to
epa
and
to
various
states
upon
delegation
from
epa
to
access
that
information
to
help
osha
target
asbestos
removal
jobs
.
osha
also
believes
that
at
this
time
some
epa
delegated
states
,
and
osha
state
plan
states
have
worked
out
ways
to
share
notifications
.
osha
believes
that
utilizing
the
epa
data
to
assist
in
targeting
inspections
will
be
more
effective
than
duplicative
reporting
requirements
.
the
agency
believes
,
based
on
its
own
enforcement
experience
that
a
limited
notification
requirement
may
enhance
compliance
in
specified
circumstances
.
employers
who
choose
to
use
new
or
modified
control
technology
to
reduce
exposures
in
class
i
asbestos
work
,
must
notify
osha
in
advance
,
using
epas
neshap
reporting
form
.
such
information
about
new
and
or
modified
asbestos
control
technology
submitted
to
osha
by
employers
who
wish
to
use
it
will
provide
accessible
information
for
the
agency
to
use
to
evaluate
such
technologies
.
osha
believes
that
requiring
employers
to
routinely
submit
to
the
agency
their
data
in
support
of
claims
of
the
effectiveness
of
new
technology
will
help
osha
,
employers
and
employees
and
their
representatives
to
evaluate
its
effectiveness
promptly
.
shipyard
employment
standard
one
area
of
the
proposed
standard
to
which
sesac
raised
objection
was
the
requirement
that
osha
be
notified
10
days
prior
to
initiating
work
on
large
scale
asbestos
operations
.
in
addition
to
reiterating
many
of
the
objections
to
the
provision
raised
by
others
,
they
pointed
out
that
often
they
must
immediately
work
on
ships
which
enter
their
shipyards
and
turn
them
around
quickly
and
that
the
delay
caused
by
the
notification
would
be
overly
burdensome
.
as
osha
explained
above
,
notification
of
osha
is
required
only
when
class
i
operations
are
undertaken
and
alternate
methods
of
control
,
other
than
the
negativepressure
negative
pressure
enclosure
methodology
,
is
to
be
employed
.
this
provision
applies
both
in
the
construction
and
shipyard
employment
standards
.
b
.
notification
of
other
employers
and
subsequent
owners
the
court
remanded
the
issue
of
whether
osha
should
,
as
recommended
by
bctd
,
require
employers
contracting
asbestosrelated
asbestos
related
work
to
establish
,
maintain
and
transfer
to
building
owners
written
records
of
the
presence
and
locations
of
asbestos
or
asbestos
products
,
in
order
to
facilitate
identification
and
prevention
of
asbestos
hazards
.
as
noted
in
the
1990
remand
proposal
,
the
court
remanded
this
issue
so
that
the
agency
may
reach
`
its
own
judgment
on
the
issue
'
of
whether
it
was
legally
empowered
to
adopt
such
a
requirement
(
see
bctd
v

brock
,
supra
at
1278
.
osha
concludes
that
bctd
has
made
a
persuasive
case
for
the
need
to
expand
the
notification
provisions
to
other
employer
and
building
owners
and
from
them
to
subsequent
employers
with
exposed
employees
.
this
is
a
necessary
way
to
informing
subsequent
employers
that
their
employees
are
at
risk
of
asbestos
exposure
and
of
the
need
to
take
appropriate
precautions
.
requiring
building
owners
to
maintain
and
provide
this
information
is
by
far
the
most
effective
way
of
notifying
employers
of
exposed
employees
who
are
doing
work
many
years
after
the
asbestos
was
identified
.
osha
has
developed
an
information
transfer
scheme
concerning
the
presence
of
asbestos
in
buildings
and
structures
which
may
present
a
hazard
to
employees
which
is
more
comprehensive
than
the
recommendation
of
bctd
.
the
approach
places
the
primary
compliance
burden
on
the
building
and
or
facility
owner
,
even
though
the
employees
at
risk
may
not
be
the
owners
direct
employees
.
thus
,
this
final
standard
confirms
oshas
tentative
view
in
the
proposal
,
that
it
has
authority
to
require
building
owners
who
are
statutory
employers
to
take
necessary
and
appropriate
remedial
action
such
as
notifying
other
employers
,
to
protect
employees
other
than
their
own
(
see

at

.
the
proposed
hazard
communication
provision
limited
the
building
owners
communication
obligations
to
`
available
'
information
concerning
the
presence
and
location
of
asbestos
.
now
,
in
the
final
standard
,
the
building
owner
must
communicate
his
knowledge
of
the
presence
and
location
of
acm
,
based
on
`
available
'
information
,
and
,
new
to
the
final
standard

are
