special
note
:
as
originally
stated
in
the
08/20/1987
,
ptfp
final
rules
,
and
as
reaffirmed
and
clarified
in
a
11/22/1991
,
ptfp
policy
statement
,
ntia
has
established
a
policy
which
is
intended
to
encourage
stations
to
increase
from
25
%
to
50
%
the
matching
percentage
in
their
proposals
for
equipment
replacement
,
improvement
,
and
augmentation
.
the
agency
has
emphasized
that
applicants
proposing
to
provide
first
service
to
a
geographic
area
encounter
considerable
ineligible
costs
,
including
construction
or
renovation
of
buildings
or
other
similar
expenses
.
ntia
,
therefore
,
expects
to
continue
funding
projects
to
extend
service
at
up
to
75
%
of
the
total
project
cost
.
applicants
from

communitylicensed
community

,
or
those
who
can
show
that
a
station
licensed
to
a
large
institution
cannot
obtain
direct
or
inkind
in
kind
support
from
the
larger

,
also
will
not
be
subject
to
this
preference
.
otherwise
,
a
showing
of
extraordinary
need
or
an
emergency
situation
will
be
taken
into
consideration
as
justification
for
grants
of
up
to
75
%
of
the
project
cost
,
but
the
presumption
of
50
%
funding
will
be
the
general
rule
for
applications
calling
for
the
replacement
,
improvement
,
or
augmentation
of
equipment
.
(

)
no
part
of
the
grantees
matching
share
of
the
eligible
project
costs
may
be
met
with
funds
paid
by
the
federal
government
,
except
where
the
use
of
such
funds
to
meet
a
federal
matching
requirement
is
specifically
and
expressly
authorized
by
federal
statute
.
(

)
funds
supplied
to
an
applicant
by
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting
may
not
be
used
for
the
required
nonfederal
federal
matching
purposes
,
except
upon
a
clear
and
compelling
showing
of
need
.
(

)
the
expenditure
of
any
local
matching
funds
prior
to
the
closing
date
will
be
disallowed
.
(
5
)
the
applicants
should
note
that
expenditure
of
local
matching
funds
prior
to
the
award
of
a
grant
is
at
the
applicants
own
risk
.
the
exact
amount
of
the
match
will
not
be
known
with
certainty
until
the
final
award
agreement
is
negotiated
.
therefore
,
should
the
applicants
expenditure
of
nonfederal
federal
funds
exceed
the
nonfederal
federal
share
which
will
be
established
in
the
final
award
agreement
,
then
either
the
federal
share
of
the
total
project
cost
may
be
reduced
by
a
corresponding
amount
,
or
no
federal
award
may
be
offered
