summary
:
this
order
reopens
the
proceeding
and
modifies
the
commissions
consent
order
issued
on
08/06/1990
,
by
deleting
the
requirement
to
lease
to
a
third
party
the
rabies
vaccine
business
that
the
company
acquired
when
it
purchased
connaught
biosciences
,
inc
.
the
commission
concluded
that
the
record
does
not
show
any
approvable
lessee
despite
merieuxs
efforts
to
find
one
,
and
that
retaining
the
lease
requirement
imposes
significant
costs
on
merieux
and
could
result
in
adverse
impact
on
public
health
needs
.
