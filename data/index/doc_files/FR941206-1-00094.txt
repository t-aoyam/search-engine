section
183b4
)
of
the
act
,
as
amended
in
1990
(
1990
amendments
,
requires
the
administrator
to
issue
ctgs
for
voc
and
particulate
emissions
from
coatings
(
paints
)
and
solvents
used
in
shipbuilding
and
ship
repair
facilities
,
to
such
level
as
the
administrator
determines
may
be
achieved
through
the
adoption
of
bacm
.
volatile
organic
compounds
react
in
the
atmosphere
to
form
ozone
,
a
criteria
air
pollutant
for
which
primary
and
secondary
ambient
air
quality
standards
have
been
established
.
the
epa
is
required
to
take
into
account
the
applicable
requirements
of
section
112
in
developing
the
guidelines
.
the
organic
hap
emissions
described
in
the
remainder
of
this
document
are
,
with
only
one
exception
,
a
subset
of
the
voc
emissions
from
coatings
and
solvents
used
in
shipbuilding
and
ship
repair
facilities
.
thus
the
control
techniques
evaluated
for
the
mact
standard
are
also
applicable
to
voc
emissions
.
the
epa
has
traditionally
issued
draft
ctgs
containing
recommended
control
levels
for
public
comment
.
rather
than
issue
a
separate
draft
ctg
in
this
case
,
the
epa
is
using
this
document
to
request
public
comment
on
a
draft
recommended
by
bacm
.
the
recommended
bacm
is
identical
to
the
proposed
mact
for
coatings
and
solvents
,
stated
in
terms
of
voc
units
rather
than
vohap
units
(
where
a
vohap
means
any
compound
of
carbon
,
excluding
metallic
carbides
and
carbonates
,
that
is
listed
in
or
pursuant
to
section
112b
)
of
the
act
;
this
includes
both
voc
and
exempt
compounds
that
are
listed
as
hap
.
for
those
options
using
voc
as
a
surrogate
for
vohap
for
the
mact
standard
,
compliance
would
be
based
on
the
agencys
reference
method
24
.
for
any
compliance
option
involving
measurement
of
actual
vohap
content
,
the
test
method
used
by
the
source
must
be
documented
and
approved
by
the
administrator
.
comments
received
on
the
proposed
mact
rule
will
also
be
considered
in
formulating
a
final
recommended
bacm
and
viceversa
vice
versa
.
meanwhile
,
states
are
in
the
process
of
developing
voc
rules
for
these
sources
to
meet
other
act
requirements
.
the
epa
published
an
alternative
control
techniques
(
act
)
document
in
02/19/1994
to
provide
guidance
to
the
states
for
these
efforts
.
the
recommended
bacm
described
here
is
consistent
with
information
in
the
act
.
also
,
as
explained
in
the
act
,
although
control
technologies
for
particulate
emissions
at
shipyards
are
in
development
,
none
are
sufficiently
demonstrated
at
this
time
to
recommend
as
bacm
.
therefore
,
the
agency
has
no
recommendation
for
bacm
for
particulate
emissions
at
this
time
.

in
general
,
the
shipbuilding

covered
by
the

is
represented
by

however
,
sic
code
3731
includes
the
manufacture
of
both
offshore

and
production
platforms
;
marine
coatings
used
on
such

will
not

rather
to
limitations
imposed
by

based
on
information
obtained
through

there
are
an

437
facilities

an
estimated
25
qualify
as
major
sources
of

the
total
