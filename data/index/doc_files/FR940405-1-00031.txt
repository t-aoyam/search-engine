in
order
to
avoid
any
further
confusion
on
this
issue
,
however
,
the
department
has
decided
to
issue
its
regulations
on
costs
of
incarceration
as
two
separate
rules
.
the
first
rule
,
proposed
for
codification
at
28
cfr
0
96c
,
provides
the
authority
for
establishing
and
collecting
a
fee
for
the
costs
of
one
year
of
incarceration
.
this
rule
also
specifies
the
calculation
used
to
determine
the
average
cost
of
incarceration
.
in
addition
,
the
rule
designates
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
as
being
responsible
for
the
review
of
the
fee
,
for
its
calculation
in
accordance
with
the
formula
set
forth
in
§
0
96c
,
and
for
the
publication
of
each
years
fee
(
or
revised
fee
)
as
a
notice
in
the
federal
register
.
this
rule
also
delegates
to
the
director
the
authority
to
promulgate
regulations
concerning
the
collection
of
the
fee
,
to
be
codified
as
a
second
rule
at
28
cfr
part
505
.
as
previously
proposed
,
the
director
would
have
been
required
both
to
public
the
current
fee
as
a
notice
in
the
federal
register
and
to
amend
the
fee
in
the
regulation
.
this
requirement
has
been
modified
in
the
interest
of
reducing
unnecessary
regulatory
publication
.
average
cost
of
incarceration
figure
with
regard
to
comments
concerning
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
proposed
rule
,
three
commenters
disagreed
with
the
figure
stated
in
proposed
§
5052b
)
representing
the
average
cost
of
incarceration
.
two
commenters
asserted
that
the
average

is
not

basis
for
those
inmates
placed
in
or
transferred
to
minimumsecurityand
minimum

thus
lower

within
the
first
year
.
one
commenter
stated
that
the
figure
was
irrational
,
believing
that
the
assessment
would
reduce
inmates
to
the
poverty
level
.
finally
,
one
commenter
contended
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
should
not
determine
the
average
cost
of
incarceration
figure
.
despite
these
contentions
,
the
attorney
general
believes
that
this
figure
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
implementing
statute
.
the
plain
language
of
section
111
of
public
law
102395
orders
the
attorney
general
to
`
establish
and
collect
a
fee
to
cover
the
costs
of
confinement
'
with
such
fee
being
`
equivalent
to
the
average
cost
of
one
year
of
incarcertation

,
1842
(

.
although
at
first
glance
it
may
seem
fair
to
assess
each
fee
based
upon
each
individual
inmates
cost
of
incarceration
,
this
figure
would
not
represent
the
`
average
cost
'
to
the
united
states
to
confine
every
prisoner
.
nor
would
basing
the
fee
upon
each
inmates
initially
designated
institution
be
a
fair
assessment
.
while
an
inmate
initially
could
be
designated
to
a
lower
cost
facility
,
within
the
first
year
he
or
she
might
be
redesignated
to
a
higher
security
administrative
,
and
higher
cost
,
institution
.
thus
,
the
figure
merely
represents
the
average
cost
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
confine
any
prisoner
and
,
accordingly
,
is
a
reasonable
choice
for
the
attorney
general
to
make
in
order
to
comply
with
the
statute
.
however
,
to
clarify
the
process
and
address
these
concerns
,
the
department
is
including
in
the
proposed
rule
the
formula
used
to
calculate
the
average
cost
of
one
year
of
incarceration
(
see
§
0
96c
.
this
calculation
is
intended
to
provide
a
figure
reflective
of
the
actual
costs
expended
to
maintain
inmates
at
bureau
facilities
.
the
fee
is
calculated
by
dividing
the
expenses
incurred
at
the
central
,
regional
,
and
institution
level
in
such
areas
as
salaries
,
supplies
,
travel
,
and
equipment
for
the
care
and
custody
of
inmates
(
eg
,
security
,
programming
,
maintenance
and
general
administration
,
excluding
activation
costs
,
by
the
number
of
inmate
days
,
and
by
then
multiplying
the
quotient
by
365
.
the
number
of
inmate
days
is
calculated
by
adding
,
cumulatively
,
the
number
of
inmates
in
custody
at
a
given
time
each
day
for
the
one
year
period
.
activation
costs
are
those
expenses
incurred
by
the
bureau
in
the
construction
of
new
facilities
and
in
their
operation
before
staff
assume
control
of
the
facility
for
the
arrival
of
inmates
.
