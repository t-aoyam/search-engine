one
commenter
felt
that
it
is
unwise
to
rely
heavily
on
the
presence
of
bilingual
female
staff
as
the
key
factor
in
improving
services
to
refugee
women
.
the
commenter
felt
that
the
relevance
of
service
matters
much
more
.
response
:
the
issue
is
access
to
services
,
not
just
relevance
of
service
.
we
believe
that
access
to
services
and
communication
between
client
and
provider
improve
significantly
for
refugee
women
when
there
are
bilingual
women
on
staff
to
provide
services
to
these
clients

we
have
limited

because
these

are
intended
to
serve

we
have
not

with
fewer

the
