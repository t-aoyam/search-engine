this

numerous
provisions

self

that
is
,
the
provisions
are
stated
in
terms
that
neither
require
nor
permit
exercise
of
discretion

.
the
plain
wording
of
the
law
causes
a
conflict
with
several
of
our
existing
regulations

in
other
cases
,
the
regulations
simply
do
not

making
the

changes
to
incorporate
the
new
provisions
into
