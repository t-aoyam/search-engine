other
osha
health
standards
have
adopted
similar
requirements
with
respect
to
those
proposed
in
this
notice
regarding
the
designated
person
.
for
example
,
final
standards
for
chromium
(
57
fr
42102
)
and
lead
(
58
fr
26590
)
require
that
a
technically
knowledgeable
`
competent
person
'
be
on
site
during
construction
activities
,
which
often
involve
multiple
employers
.
osha
concluded
in
those
standards
that
designating
a
person
to
act
on
the
employers
'
behalf
to
ensure
compliance
with
various
provisions
of
those
standards
,
was
necessary
because
of
the
need
for
continual
site
characterization
and
analysis
to
identify
the
hazards
present
and
the
types
of
control
measures
and
remedial
actions
that
are
effective
.
for
these
same
reasons
,
osha
proposes
requirements
for
designated
persons
under
this
notice
.
the
term
`
designated
smoking
area
'
means
a
room
in
which
smoking
of
tobacco
products
is
permitted
.
the
agency
believes
that
establishment
of
`
designated
smoking
areas
'
is
necessary
to
prevent
employee
exposure
to
ets
in
workplaces
where
smoking
is
not
prohibited
.
provisions
are
included
in
this
proposal
addressing
design
,
construction
and
operation
of
such
areas
to
meet
this
purpose
.
the
term
`
director
'
means
the
director
,
national
institute
for
occupational
safety
and
health
(
niosh
,
us
.
department
of
health
and
human
services
,
or
designee
.
the
term
`
employer
'
means
all
persons
defined
as
employers
by
section
35
)
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
of
1970
including
employers
(
such
as
building
owners
or
lessees
)
who
control
the
ventilation
or
maintenance
of
premises
where
employees
of
other
employers
work
.
for
purposes
of
the
proposal
,
an
employer
is
also
defined
as
a
person
who
exercises
control
over
the
ventilation
systems
in
the
workplace
.
control
over
the
ventilation
systems
is
a
multifaceted
faceted
concept
:
it
includes
maintenance
,
recordkeeping
and
the
development
and
implementation
of
the
indoor
air
quality
compliance
plan
.
while
responsibility
for
various
aspects
of
the
ventilation
system
encompasses
many
duties
,
the
proposal
does
not
necessarily
contemplate
that
all
of
the
duties
will
be
performed
by
the
same
person
.
the
proposal
is
flexible
in
that
regard
and
responsibility
for
the
various
aspects
can
be
shared
by
various
persons
depending
on
the
circumstances
.
in
many
instances
the
employer
will
either
be
the
owner
of
the
building
where
the
workplace
is
located
or
will
be
a
long
term
lessee
,
responsible
under
the
lease
for
the
care
and
maintenance
of
the
property
.
in
these
cases
,
the
owner
employer
would
take
care
of
the
ventilation
system
by
designating
knowledgeable
persons
within
his
employ
to
the
necessary
tasks
or
by
hiring
competent
contractors
.
in
other
cases
,
there
will
be
a
number
of
different
businesses
all
located
in
separate
leased
space
within
the
same
building
.
in
these
instances
the
various
employer
lessees
would
probably
share
responsibility
for
compliance
with
the
proposed
standard
.
for
example
,
each
individual
lessee
might
be
obligated
to
provide
the
building
owner
with
a
description
of
the
work
activity
planned
for
within
its
particular
leased
space
,
including
the
number
of
employees
or
visitors
expected
,
the
hours
of
work
operation
and
any
situations
where
air
contaminants
may
be
released
into
the
workplace
air
.
air
contaminants
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
released
into
the
workplace
air
as
a
result
of
the
installation
of
new
furniture
or
wall
coverings
,
any
painting
or
remodeling
scheduled
to
take
place
or
any
pest
extermination
activity
within
the
premises
.
each
employer
would
,
of
course
,
be
responsible
for
reporting
to
whoever
is
in
charge
of
the
ventilation
system
,
any
employee
complaints
or
signs
or
symptoms
that
may
be
related
to
buildingrelated
building
related
illness
.
the
building
owners
or
whoever
is
in
charge
of
the
maintenance
of
the
ventilation
system
would
be
in
a
position
to
develop
standard
operating
procedures
for
the
building
systems
as
well
as
special
procedures
for
emergencies
and
maintenance
.
in
addition
such
a
person
would
be
in
a
position
to
know
or
develop
an
appropriate
maintenance
schedule
and
to
gather
relevant
documents
to
assist
in
the
care
and
maintenance
of
the
ventilation
system
,
such
as
diagrams
of
the
system
,
manufacturers
manuals
,
and
inspection
guidelines
and
schedules
for
the
proper
maintenance
of
such
systems
.
the
same
person
might
also
be
responsible
for
maintaining
and
operating
the
hvac
system
to
provide
the
required
air
ventilation
rate
and
desired
relative
humidity
.
the
proposal
is
designed
in
this
performance
oriented
manner
to
afford
affected
employers
the
flexibility
to
assure
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
a
system
to
provide
healthful
indoor
air
quality
in
the
most
sensible
and
efficient
way
possible
considering
their
particular
circumstances
.
