for
impotence

the
methods
for
treating

ohta
solicited

announced
that
it
was
assessing
the

ohta
researched

analyzed

we
received

on

for

dated
10/31/1989

we
asked
for
an
assessment

the

not

although
ohtas
assessment

we
have
determined
that
the

still
accurate

in
the
assessment
,
ohta
concluded
that
reliable
tests
for
evaluating
impotence
include
doppler
ultrasound
,
arteriography
,
cavernosography
,
cavernosometry
,
hormonal
assays
,
and
electrophysiological
testing
.
npt
testing
by
plethysmography
and
other
monitoring
devices
in
the
clinical
setting
or
in
the
home
is
determined
to
be
unreliable
.
according
to
ohta
,
there
are
no
accepted
standards
for
npt
test
results
.
results
cannot
be
compared
among
laboratories
because
each
laboratory
has
its
own
set
of
standards
by
which
to
evaluate
npt
.
falsepositive
false
positive
and
falsenegative
false
negative
results
occur
frequently
indicating
that
npt
testing
is
not
a
reliable
index
for
differentiating
organic
from
psychogenic
impotence
,
thereby
making
it
impossible
to
choose
the
appropriate
treatment
.
also

ohta
does
not
consider

provisions
of
this
proposed
notice
based
on
the
conclusion
of
the
ohta
technology
assessment
that
scientific
evidence
indicates
that
npt
testing
is
not
a
reliable
index
for
evaluating
impotence
,
we
have
concluded
that
npt
testing
does
not
meet
our
criteria
for
effectiveness
.
therefore
,
we
propose
to
revise
our
national
policy
by
withdrawing
coverage
for
npt
testing
in
the
sleep
disorder
clinic
.
we
do
not
have
a
national
policy
regarding
npt
testing
in
other
settings
.
therefore
,
we
propose
to
exclude
coverage
for
npt
testing
,
rather
than
withdraw
coverage
,
in
all
other
settings
.
because
npt
test
results
are
not
standardized
and
are
frequently
inaccurate
and
have
a
high
rate
of
falsepositive
false
positive
and
falsenegative
false
negative
results
,
the
appropriate
treatment
cannot
be
determined
