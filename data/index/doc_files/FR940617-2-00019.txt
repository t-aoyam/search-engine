critical

petitioners
alleged
that
critical
circumstances
exist
with
respect
to
imports
of
silicomanganese
from
ukraine
.
pursuant
to
section
733e1
)
of
the
act
and
19
cfr

16
(
1993
,
we
requested
shipment
information
from
zaporozhye
and
nikopol
and
attempted
to
analyze
that
information
using
the
departments
standard
methodology
.
to
find
critical
circumstances
,
we
must
determine
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe
or
suspect
that
1
)
there
is
a
history
of
dumping
in
the
united
states
or
elsewhere
of
the
same
class
or
kind
of
subject
merchandise
,
or
the
importer
knew
or
should
have
known
that
the
producer
or
reseller
was
selling
the
subject
merchandise
at
less
than
its
foreign
market
value
;
and
2
)
there
have
been
massive
imports
of
the
subject
merchandise
over
a
relatively
short
period
.
we
have
not
found
a
history
of
dumping
of
ukrainian
silicomanganese
in
the
united
states
or
elsewhere
.
according
to
department
practice
,
however
,
we
will
impute
knowledge
of
dumping
to
importers
of
subject
merchandise
when
the
dumping
margin
exceeds
25
percent
in
purchase
price
situations
.
in
this
case
,
the
estimated
dumping
margin
for
silicomanganese
imports
from
ukraine
is
123
02
percent
,
a
rate
which
exceeds
our
benchmark
for
imputing
knowledge
of
dumping
.
therefore
,
we
have
preliminarily
found
that
importers
should
be
imputed
knowledge
of
dumping
of
the
subject
merchandise
.
pursuant
to
19
cfr
353
16
,
the
department
considers
imports
of
subject
merchandise
to
be
massive
if
there
has
been
an
increase
of
15
percent
or
more
over
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
.
we
also
consider
,
when
possible
,
the
respondents
share
of
import
penetration
of
the
domestic
market
in
making
this
determination
.
in
this
case
,
evidence
indicates
that
ukrainian
us
.
market
penetration
has
increased
.
to
determine
whether
imports
increased
,
we
have
examined
the
volume
of
imports
by
comparing
volumes
for
the
five
months
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
(
11/19/1993
through
03/19/1994
)
to
the
five
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
(
06/19/1993
through
10/19/1993
.
although
zaporozhye
has
provided
adequate
information
to
perform
an
analysis
of
whether
imports
have
increased
,
nikopol
has
not
done
so
.
specifically
,
the
shipment
information
provided
by
nikopol
was
inconsistent
with
its
sales
data
.
(
(
see
the
concurrence
memorandum
,
dated
06/10/1994
)
given
that
neither
company
has
established
its
eligibility
for
separate
dumping
margins
,
the
data
concerning
critical
circumstances
must
be
considered
in
a
consolidated
manner
.
accordingly
,
given
the
lack
of
adequate
information
,
we
preliminarily
determined
that
there
have
been
massive
imports
of
silicomanganese
from
the
ukraine
.
based
on
the
foregoing
,
the
department
preliminarily
finds
that
critical
circumstances
exist
in
this
case
.
