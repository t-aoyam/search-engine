which
had

not
been
considered
by

in
reaching
its
decision

to
support
its

determination

the
vision
waiver
study
has
now
been
in
effect
since
07/19/1992
,
and
has
collected
driver
safety
and
performance
data
periodically
for
approximately
two
years
.
individuals
driving
pursuant
to
waivers
are
required
to
submit
reports
of
vehicle
miles
travelled
monthly
.
they
are
also
required
to
report
any
citation
for
a
moving
violation
involving
a

and
the
judicial
or
administrative
disposition
of
such
charge
,
and

of

participating

are
required
to
submit
annual
reports
from
an
ophthalmologist
or
optometrist
attesting
to
the
present
condition
of
their
vision
.
any
loss
of
vision
bringing
them
below
the
waiver
standard
of
20/40
in
the
better
eye
results
in
immediate
discharge
from
the
program
.
drivers
participating
in
the
program
are
subject
to
revocation
of
their
waiver
for
failure
to
meet
certain
reporting
requirements
or
if
the
vision
in
their
better
eye
falls
below
the
required
standard
.
the
agency
strictly
holds
waived
drivers
to
these
requirements
and
standards
.
as
of
09/30/1994
,
a
total
of
201
drivers
have
had
their
waivers
revoked
.
of
that
number
,
21
drivers
were
revoked
for
failing
to
submit
an
annual
medical
exam
.
the
remaining
180
drivers
were
revoked
for
failing
to
submit
monthly
driving
reports
on
time
.
no
drivers
have
had
their
waivers
revoked
for
decreasing
visual
acuity
;
however
,
two
drivers
have
voluntarily
withdrawn
from
the
program
on
this
basis
.
based
upon
statistical
analysis
of
this
information
conducted
by
the
contractor
,
the
agency
can
conclude
that
the
driving
performance
of
individuals
participating
in
the
vision
waiver
program
is
better
than
the
driving
performance
of
all
cmv
drivers
collectively
,
based
on
data
obtained
from
the
general
estimates
service
(
ges
.
the
ges
is
a
national
survey
conducted
by
the
national
highway
traffic
safety
administration
,
and
was
selected
for
use
as
the
best
measure
of
the
prevailing
national
norm
relative
to
large
truck
accidents
.
the
third
interim
monitoring
report
,
prepared
by
the
contractor
responsible
for
fhwas
vision
waiver
program
,
dated
06/27/1994
,
reported
on
the
cumulative
driving
performance
of
those
individuals
participating
in
the
waiver
group
between
07/19/1992
and
02/19/1994
.
during
that
period
,
a
total
of
211
accidents
were
reported
and
a
total
of
1364
million
vmt
had
been
recorded
.
the
number
of
accidents
in
this
period
divided
by
the
vmt
give
an
accident
rate
of
1
547
accidents
per
million
vmt
.
the
national
accident
rate
for
large
truck
accidents
,
as
reported
by
the
ges
for
the
year
1992
,
is
2
531
accidents
per
million
vmt
.
a
copy
of
this
report
is
contained
in
the
docket
.
the
reports
submitted
by
the
drivers
are
independently
verified
through
periodic
records
checks
with
state
mvds
.
while
drivers
in
the
study
are
required
to
report
all
accident
involvement
,
the
state
mvds
only
record
accidents
warranting
reports
under
existing
state
requirements
.
similarly
,
the
ges
data
only
contain
accidents
recorded
by
state
mvds
.
therefore
,
the
drivers
in
the
waiver
study
are
held
accountable
for
more
accidents
than
those
included
in
ges
statistics
.
the
fhwas
contractor
,
which
is
performing
the
data
collection
,
the
statistical
analysis
and
preparation
of
the
interim
reports
,
was
subjected
to
a
peer
review
of
its
procedures
and
methodology
,
a
summary
of
which
is
included
in
the
docket
.
a
fourth
interim
report
is
in
preparation
at
this
time
,
and
covers
cumulative
activities
and
mileage
through
06/30/1994
.
a
review
of
the
data
indicates
that
the
performance
of
the
study
group
remains
relatively
unchanged
,
as
the
accident
rate
is
only
slightly
higher
than
previously
reported
,
ie
.
1
636
accidents
per
one
million
vmt
.
the
completed
report
will
be
placed
in
the
docket
along
with
all
preceding
interim
reports
.
