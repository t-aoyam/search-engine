thus
,
although
the
standard
does
not
explicitly
require
the
preparation
of
a
written
asbestos
removal
plan
,
the
usual
constituents
of
such
a
plan
,
ie
,
a
description
of
the
enclosure
,
the
equipment
,
and
the
procedures
to
be
used
throughout
the
project
,
must
be
determined
before
the
enclosure
can
be
erected
.
the
following
information
should
be
included
in
the
planning
of
the
system
:
a
physical
description
of
the
work
area
;
a
description
of
the
approximate
amount
of
material
to
be
removed
;
a
schedule
for
turning
off
and
sealing
existing
ventilation
systems
;
personnel
hygiene
procedures
;
a
description
of
personal
protective
equipment
and
clothing
to
worn
by
employees
;
a
description
of
the
local
exhaust
ventilation
systems
to
be
used
and
how
they
are
to
be
tested
;
a
description
of
work
practices
to
be
observed
by
employees
;
an
air
monitoring
plan
;
a
description
of
the
method
to
be
used
to
transport
waste
material
;
and
the
location
of
the
dump
site
.
materials
and
equipment
necessary
for
asbestos
removal
although
individual
asbestos
removal
projects
vary
in
terms
of
the
equipment
required
to
accomplish
the
removal
of
the
materials
,
some
equipment
and
materials
are
common
to
most
asbestos
removal
operations
.
plastic
sheeting
used
to
protect
horizontal
surfaces
,
seal
hvac
openings
or
to
seal
vertical
openings
and
ceilings
should
have
a
minimum
thickness
of
6
mils
.
tape
or
other
adhesive
used
to
attach
plastic
sheeting
should
be
of
sufficient
adhesive
strength
to
support
the
weight
of
the
material
plus
all
stresses
encountered
during
the
entire
duration
of
the
project
without
becoming
detached
from
the
surface
.
other
equipment
and
materials
which
should
be
available
at
the
beginning
of
each
project
are
:
_
hepa
filtered
vacuum
is
essential
for
cleaning
the
work
area
after
the
asbestos
has
been
removed
.
it
should
have
a
long
hose
capable
of
reaching
outoftheway
out
of
the
way
places
,
such
as
areas
above
ceiling
tiles
,
behind
pipes
,
etc
.
_
portable
air
ventilation
systems
installed
to
provide
the
negative
air
pressure
and
air
removal
from
the
enclosure
must
be
equipped
with
a
hepa
filter
.
the
number
and
capacity
of
units
required
to
ventilate
an
enclosure
depend
on
the
size
of
the
area
to
be
ventilated
.
the
filters
for
these
systems
should
be
designed
in
such
a
manner
that
they
can
be
replaced
when
the
air
flow
volume
is
reduced
by
the
buildup
build
of
dust
in
the
filtration
material
.
pressure
monitoring
devices
with
alarms
and
strip
chart
recorders
attached
to
each
system
to
indicate
the
pressure
differential
and
the
loss
due
to
dust
buildup
on
the
filter
are
recommended
.
