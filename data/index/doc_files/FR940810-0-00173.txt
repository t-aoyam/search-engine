many

are
increasingly
substituting

the
market
forces
behind

appear
to
be

to
legal

and

for

since

generally
occurs

any

osha
also
examined
the
impacts
on
small

in

to
determine
if
they
would
be
adversely
affected
by
the
final
standard

using
data
for

fewer

osha
compared
compliance

with

,
sales
,
and
pretax
tax
profits
for
affected
industries
identified
as
containing

the

include
small

osha
projects
that

would
be
11
percent
of

for

and
packings
and
that
compliance
costs
would
be

costs

of

shown

are
significantly
higher
,
suggesting
that

reductions
could
be
felt
by
any

unable
to

however
,
as
discussed
above
,
osha
believes
these
firms
will
be
able
to
pass
along
most
of

of

by
raising

and
will
therefore

are

to

as
a

with
the

as

on
the
basis
of
these

estimates
,
osha
has
therefore
concluded
that
overall

in

repair
will
be
modest
and
that
there
will
be
no
