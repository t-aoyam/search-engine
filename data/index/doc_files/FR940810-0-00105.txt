the

that

steven

,
counsel
to
the
ncra
agreed
:

that

where

what

you

worked

(

the
normal

requirements
of
doing

monitoring

having
respirators

have
good

.
in
such
atypical
circumstances
,
additional
precautions
,
including
respirator
use
and
more
extensive
wetting
,
will
be
necessary
.
nrcas
objection
to
the
routine
use
of
respirators
on
roofing
jobs
,
as
recommended
by
bctd
,
was
based
on
its
view
that
respirator
use
on
roofs
often
compromises
worker
safety
,
because
respirators
reduce
`
downward
visibility
'
of
the
wearer
(
tr
.
2463
.
osha
agrees
that
in
some
roofing
conditions
,
limitations
from
wearing
respirators
might
occur
.
when
respirator
use
is
necessary
because
of
the
condition
of
the
roofing
material
,
but
respirators
cannot
be
safely
worn
because
of
great
heat
,
cold
,
or
high
winds
,
etc
,
such
roofing
jobs
shall
not
be
performed
until
they
can
be
done
safely
.
the
agency
has
concluded
that
`
routine
'
respirator
use
is
not
required
,
because
as
discussed
above
the
required
work
practices
will
keep
exposures
low
in
normal
circumstances
;
but
where
historic
data
,
experience
of
the
crew
,
or
the
condition
of
the
roof
indicate
the
possibility
of
higher
exposures
,
then
respirator
use
is
required
.
various
studies

were
submitted
support
oshas
classification
of
roofing
removal
as
a
class
ii
activity
.
they
show
that
most
measured
exposures
are
lower
than
many
studies
showing
removal
of

materials
;
but
still
may
be
significant
.
in
most
cases
levels
below
the

can
be
routinely
expected
with
