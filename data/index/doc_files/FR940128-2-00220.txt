for
purposes
of
this
proposal
,
the
exchange
has
defined
an
agency
cross
to
be
a
cross
where
neither
the
order
to
buy
nor
the
order
to
sell
is
for
the
account
of
any
member
or

at
present
,
exchange
rules
require
members
,
or
member
organizations
,
with
both
an
order
to
buy
and
an
order
to
sell
the
same
security
to
offer
publicly
such
security
at
a
price
which
is
higher
than
the
bid
by
the
minimum
variation
permitted
in
such
security
(
generally
an
1/8th
)
before
making
a
transaction
with
himself
,
or
itself
.
the
ability
of
specialists
,
in
particular
,
to
participate
in
agency
crosses
,
even
when
they
are
not
disseminating
a
bid
or
offer
at
the
cross
price
,
greatly
decreases
the
likelihood
of
immediate
execution
of
the
cross
orders
for
order
sending
firms
.
the
proposed
rule
change
therefore
is
designed
to
give
order
sending
firms
greater
assurances
that
their
cross
orders
will
be
executed
quickly
and
without
interference
.
because
this
proposal
addresses
only
the
circumstances
under
which
an
mse
specialist
must
refrain
from
participating
in
a
cross
transaction
,
the
proposal
would
not
excuse
members
from
the
requirement
to
bid
and
offer
stock
as
set
out
in
rule
23
.
as
such
,
the
proposal
would
still
permit
a
member
in
the
crowd
to
participate
at
the
cross
price
,
or
better
,
during
the
bidding
and
offering
at
the
post
.
however
,
a
specialist
would
not
be
permitted
to
interfere
with
the
cross
during
the
bidding
and
offering
at
a
price
which
he
is
not
currently
disseminating
in
his
quote
.
however
,
a
specialist
could
participate
in
the
cross
at
the
cross
price
if
he
was
previously
sought
out
for
assistance
in
executing
any
part
of
the
cross
trade
.

conversely
,
this
proposal
would
allow
a
specialist
who
has
a
disseminated
bid
or
offer
at
the
cross
price
to
participate
at
that
cross
price
,
even
in
a
size
greater
then
the
specialists
disseminated
market

under
the
proposed
rule
,
a
customer
order
in
the
book
could
not
be
`
disadvantaged
'
by
a
cross
transaction
because
the
proposal
would
apply
only
to
crosses
at
prices
between
the
disseminated
exchange
market
.
moreover
,
the
exchanges
existing
rules
of
priority
and
precedence
would
not
be
affected
in
any
way
under
this
proposal
.
therefore
,
even
though
a
specialist
would
be
precluded
from
participating
with
a
cross
at
a
price
between
his
disseminated
market
,
he
would
still
be
required
to
satisfy
orders
in
this
book
at
the
cross
price
,
even
if
those
orders
are
not
being
disseminated
through
an
oversight
on
the
part
of
the
specialist
.
finally
,
the
proposed
rule
would
apply
to
only
floorbrokered
floor
brokered
orders
where
neither
order
is
for
the
account
of
a
member
or
member
organization
.
the
proposed
rule
would
apply
to
all
agency
crosses
regardless
of
size
.
