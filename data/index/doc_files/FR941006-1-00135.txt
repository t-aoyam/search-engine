fda
tentatively
concludes
that
the
objectives
of
the
proposed
regulation
regarding
the
packaging
and
labeling
of
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
will
be
best
met
if
the
agency
requires
that
the
proposed
warnings
appear
on
the
immediate
container
.
in
case
the

or
individual

are
removed
from

in
which
they
are
sold
to

or
in
case
a

of

is
transferred
by
a
pharmacist
to
a
vial
,
each
unitdose

,
or
strip
of
unit
dose
packages
,
would
bear
the
warning
that
fda
considers
essential
to
the
safe
use
of
these
products
.
the
warning
would
remind
adults
not
to
remove
the
ironcontaining
iron
containing
products
from
the
unitdose
unit
dose
package
.
in
addition
,
it
would
ensure
that
each
time
an
adult
takes
one
of
these
products
,
he
or
she
is
reminded
of
the
danger
that
the
product
poses
to
children
.
in
addition
,
if
the
warning
accompanies
each
tablet
or
group
of
tablets
,
an
adult
who
finds
a
child
eating
the
product
will
know
to
call
for
help
immediately
and
will
know
,
when
asked
by
a
health
care
professional
,
that
the
ingested
tablets
contain
iron
.
fda
is
not
proposing
specific
requirements
for
the
graphics
(
eg
,
type
size
,
bold
type
)
of
the
warning
statement
but
is
proposing
to
require
that
the
label
warning
appear
prominently
and
conspicuously
on
the
immediate
container
of
the
product
and
on
the
principal
display
panel
of
the
retail
package
,
so
that
consumers
are
given
adequate
notice
of
the
information
contained
in
the
warning
.
these
proposed
requirements
for
the
warning
statement
are
consistent
with
the
requirement
fda
established
for
protein
products
.
fda
tentatively
concludes
that
they
will
effectively
achieve
,
through
placement
rather
than
graphical
requirements
,
the
objective
sought
by
the
ag
petition
of
reaching
consumers
who
have
no
knowledge
of
irons
hazards
.
if
fda
adopts
the
regulations
that
it
is
proposing
,
manufacturers
will
have
the
flexibility
,
as
requested
in
the
ndma
petition
,
to
design
their
own
label
and
warning
notice
formats
.
the
agency
is
requesting
comments
on
the
most
efficient
way
to
ensure
that
warnings
on
the
immediate
container
will
accompany
every
tablet
until
the
time
it
is
used
.
suggestions
about
the
placement
and
design
of
unitdose
unit
dose
packaging
that
can
best
accommodate
the
required
warnings
are
invited
.
fda
also
specifically
solicits
comments
on
whether
the
general
requirement
that
the
label
warning
appear
prominently
and
conspicuously
on
the
label
is
adequate
.
should
the
agency
more
explicitly
define
in
its
regulation
the
level
of
prominence
and
conspicuousness
that
it
expects
?
if
so
,
what
should
the
agency
require
?
the
agency
notes
,
for
example
,
that
in
a
final
rule
that
required
a
new
warning
on
reye
syndrome
for
aspirin
,
it
specifically
stated
that
the
requirement
of
`
prominence
'
in
its
regulations
meant
that
manufacturers
of
aspirin
and
aspirincontaining
aspirin
containing
drug
products
had
to
use
an

statement
,
such
as

similarly
,
in
the
final
rule
on
nutrition
labeling
that
fda
adopted
in
response
to
the
nutrition
labeling
and
education
act
of
1990
,
fda
specified
a
number
of
format

to
ensure
that
the

would
be
readily
observable
and
comprehensible
(

.
fda
requests
comments
on
whether
,
to
ensure
that
the
warning
statement
will
have
its
intended
effect
,
the
agency
should
specify
more
completely
how
the

should
be

tentatively

that

required
on
ironcontaining
iron

,
and
having
evaluated
the
information
that
the
warning
statement
should
include
,
fda
is
proposing
to
amend
its
regulations
by
adding
new

for

new
§

oral
dosage

.
as
noted
above
,
under
these
proposed
regulations
,
the
warning
statement
that
must
be
used
will
depend
upon
how
the
product
is
packaged
.
for
products
that
are
packaged
in
unitdose
unit

packaging
(
eg
,
blister

)
the

is
proposing
to
require
the
following
warning
:
warningkeep

,
which
can

.
if
a

accidentally
swallows
this

,
call
a

or

immediately
.
under
this
proposal
,
this
warning
statement
will
be
required
for
all
ironcontaining
iron

packaged
in

therefore
,
it
would
be
required

on
the
labeling
of
products
containing
30
mg

more

,
which
are
subject
to
the

for

and
