'
introduction
the
following
interpretation
of
article
iii
,
section
1
of
the
associations
rules
of
fair
practice
is
adopted
by
the
board
of
governors
of
the
association
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
article
vii
,
section
3a
)
of
the
associations
bylaws
by
laws
and
article
i
,
section
3
of
the
rules
of
fair
practice
.
this
interpretation
is
based
upon
the
premise
that
members
have
an
obligation
to
make
a
bona
fide
public
distribution
at
the
public
offering
price
of
securities
of
a
public
offering
which
trade
at
a
premium
in
the
secondary
market
whenever
such
secondary
market
begins
(
a
`
hot
issue
)
regardless
of
whether
such
securities
are
acquired
by
the
member
as
an
underwriter
,
as
a
selling
group
member
,
or
from
a
member
participating
in
the
distribution
as
an
underwriter
or
a
selling
group
or
otherwise
.
the
failure
to
make
a
bona
fide
public
distribution
when
there
is
a
demand
for
an
issue
can
be
a
factor
in
artificially
raising
the
price
.
thus
,
the
failure
to
do
so
,
especially
when
the
member
may
have
information
relating
to
the
demand
for
the
securities
or
other
factors
not
generally
known
to
the
public
,
is
inconsistent
with
high
standards
of
commercial
honor
and
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trade
and
leads
to
an
impairment
of
public
confidence
in
the
fairness
of
the
investment
banking
and
securities
business
.
such
conduct
is
,
therefore
,
in
violation
of
article
iii
,
section
1
of
the
associations
rules
of
fair
practice
and
this
interpretation
thereof
which
establishes
guidelines
in
respect
to
such
activity
.
as
in
the
case
of
any
other
interpretation
issued
by
the
board
of
governors
of
the
association
,
the
implementation
thereof
is
a
function
of
the
district
business
conduct
committees
and
the
board
of
governors
.
thus
,
the
interpretation
will
be
applied
to
a
given
factual
situation
by
individuals
active
in
the
investment
banking
and
securities
business
who
are
serving
on
these
committees
or
on
the
board
.
they
will
construe
this
interpretation
to
effectuate
its
overall
purpose
to
assure
a
public
distribution
of
securities
for
which
there
is
a
public
demand
.
the
board
of
governors
has
determined
that
a
member
who
makes
an
allocation
to
a
restricted
person
or
account
of
an
offering
that
trades
at
a
premium
in
the
secondary
market
shall
not
be
considered
to
have
violated
this
interpretation
if
it
cancels
the
allocations
for
such
restricted
person
or
account
,
prior
to
the
end
of
the
first
business
day
following
the
date
on
which
secondary
market
trading
commences
and
reallocates
such
security
at
the
public
offering
price
to
an
nonrestricted
restricted
person
or
account
.
interpretation
except
as
provided
herein
,
it
shall
be
inconsistent
with
high
standards
of
commercial
honor
and
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trade
and
a
violation
of
article
iii
,
section
1
of
the
associations
rules
of
fair
practice
for
a
member
,
or
a
person
associated
with
a
member
,
to
fail
to
make
a
bona
fide
public
distribution
at
the
public
offering
price
of
securities
of
a
public
offering
which
trade
at
a
premium
in
the
secondary
market
whenever
such
secondary
market
begins
regardless
of
whether
such
securities
are
acquired
by
the
member
as
an
underwriter
,
a
selling
group
member
or
from
a
member
participating
in
the
distribution
as
an
underwriter
or
selling
group
member
,
or
otherwise
.
therefore
,
it
shall
be
a
violation
of
article
iii
,
section
1
for
a
member
,
or
a
person
associated
with
a
member
,
to
:
1
.
continue
to
hold
any
of
the
securities
so
acquired
in

securities

member

of
any
other
broker

,
or
to
a
person
associated
with
the
member
or
with
any
other
broker
dealer
,
or
to
a
member
of
the
immediate
family
of
any
such
person
;
provided
however
,
that
:
(
a
)
this
prohibition
shall
not
apply
to
a
person
in
a
limited
registration
category
as
that
term
is
defined
below
;
and
(
b
)
the
prohibition
shall
not
apply
to
sales
to
a
member
of
the
immediate
family
of
a
person
associated
with
a
member
whose
is
not
supported
directly
or
indirectly
to
a
material
extent
by
such
person
if
the
sale
is
by
a
broker
dealer
other
than
that
employing
the
restricted
person
and
the
restricted
person
has
no
ability
to
control
the
allocation
of
the
hot
issue
.
3
.
sell
any
of
the
securities
to
a
person
who
is
a
finder
in
respect
to
the
public
offering
or
to
any

acting
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
