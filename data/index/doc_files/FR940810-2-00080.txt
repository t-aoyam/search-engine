section
9
of
the
act
prohibits
the
`
taking
'
of
endangered
species
,
like
the
blackcapped
black
capped
vireo
.
however
,
the
service
,
under
limited
circumstances
,
may
issue
permits
to
take
endangered
wildlife
species
if
such
taking
is
incidental
to
,
and
not
the
purpose
of
otherwise
lawful
activities
.
regulations
governing
permits
for
endangered
species
are
at
50
cfr

.
the
applicant
plans
to
build
a
residential
development
located
west
of
austin
approximately
2
miles
north
of
the
intersection
of
highway
360
and
farm
to
market
road
2244
in
travis
county
,
texas
.
the
development
will
occupy
approximately
1078
acres
with
225
acres
proposed
as
parkland
and
139
acres
as
greenbelt
.
these
activities
will
permanently
eliminate
about
33
acres
of
occupied
and
or
suitable
blackcapped
black
capped
vireo
habitat
.
the
applicant
proposes
to
mitigate
the
incidental
take
by
avoiding
direct
impacts
to
vireos
,
preserving
undeveloped
areas
in
their
natural
state
,
and
by
creating
,
enhancing
,
and
maintaining
100
acres
of
blackcapped
black
capped
vireo
habitat
offsite
.
the
applicant
considered
five
alternatives
but
rejected
four
of
them
because
they
were
not
economically
viable
