a

of

available
for
the
four
major
subcomponents
of
the
twrs
,
which
are
retrieval

,
immobilization
and

disposal
.
combinations
of
these
options
comprise
the
range
of
reasonable
alternatives
currently
envisioned
for
twrs
.
the
tpa
establishes
one
specific
case
within
the
range
of
alternatives
to
be
considered
in
the
twrs

.
the
twrs

will
also
evaluate
a
number
of

constructed

agreed
to
enter
into
formal

on
matters
relating

environmental
restoration
activities
,
cost
control
,
and
implementation
and
administration
of
the

.
the
negotiations
were
concluded
in
09/19/1993
,
with
tentative
agreement
on
all
matters
under
negotiation
.
the
revised
tpa
received
public
review
during
november
1993
,
and
the
tpa
was
scheduled
to
be
signed
by
the
three
parties
on
01/25/1994
.
the
full
tpa
covers
subjects
outside
the
purview
of
the
twrs
program
.
the
elements
of
the
tpa
which
are
within
the
scope
of
the
twrs
program
constitute
elements
of
the
preferred
alternative
for
purposes
of
the
twrs
eis
.
accordingly
,
the
tpa
preferred
alternative
consists
of
the
following
activities
:
&
bullupgrading
the
infrastructure
of
the
highlevel
high
level
waste
tank
farms
to
provide
improved
facility
management
and
operation
.
&
bullcharacterization
of
the
wastes
in
all
177
ssts
and
dsts
to
facilitate
treatment
,
immobilization
and
disposal
.
&
bullconstruction
and
operation
of
additional
dsts
(
beyond
the
six
tanks
proposed
in
the
interim
action
eis
noticed
here
)
as
necessary
to
support
waste
management
and
disposal
.
&
bullstabilization
of
sst
waste
by
removing
and
storing
the
pumpable
liquids
in
dsts
,
thus
reducing
the
potential
for
leaks
to
the
surrounding
soil
.
&
bullretrieval
of
the
waste
from
ssts
and
dsts
with
priority
on
the
ssts
.
the
retrieval
criterion
is
removal
of
99
%
of
the
waste
from
all
ssts
on
a
tankbytank
tank
by
tank
basis
.
&
bullconstruction
and
operation
of
a
waste
pretreatment
facility
to
treat
the
tank
waste
and
to
prepare
the
lowactivity
low
activity
fraction
for
final
processing
.
the
highactivity
high
activity
fraction
of
the
waste
would
be
stored
pending
final

.
separate
complexes
would
be
constructed
to
house
enhanced
sludge
washing
and
cesium
and
strontium
ion
exchange
processes
.
an
evaporator
would
be
included
in
the
lowactivity
low

waste
pretreatment
complex
.
these
complexes
could
be
standalone
stand
alone
facilities
,
a
set
of
distributed
facilities
,
or
part
of
a
central
processing
complex
.
&
bullconstruction

operation
of
a

waste
vitrification
plant
of
appropriate
capacity
.
bounding

may
be
used
if
definitive

are
not

doe
would
maintain
in
a
standby
condition
the
capability
to
restart
the
grout
facility
if
its
operation
is
necessary
before
new
dsts
are
available
to
provide

issues
.
&
bullstorage
disposal
of
the
vitrified

onsite
on

.
&
bullconstruction

waste
until
a

for
permanent
disposal
is
available

&
bullexisting
cesium

capsules
would
be
either
overpacked
packed
and
stored
,
or
dissolved
and
blended
with
the
