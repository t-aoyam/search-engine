sce
has
significant
previous
experience
in
pv
systems
,
and
has
the
necessary
facilities
to
perform
design
and
monitoring
functions
.
sce
has
been
involved
with
pv
since
1978
,
and
has
been
one
of
the
most
active
utilities
in
the
field
of
renewable
energy
.
by
assigning
a
manager
of
pv
applications
,
sce
has
increased
its
commitment
to
pv
development
and
implementation
.
sce
has
proposed
a
twophase
two
phase
program
,
including
a
project
feasibility
assessment
and
project
implementation
.
the
feasibility
assessment
will
identify
all
technical
,
regulatory
,
budget
schedule
,
and
environmental
issues
related
to
the
program
in
combination
with
the
installation
and
monitoring
of
several
small
,
pilot
pv
systems
.
the
results
of
this
initial
project
phase
will
be
used
by
sce
and
doe
to
determine
the
merits
of
proceeding
to
the
second
phase
.
phase
ii
will
include
pv
system
final
design
,
installation
,
and
performance
monitoring
,
and
will
proceed
only
after
completion
of
phase
i
and
after
approval
from
doe
.
the
team
proposed
by
sce
has
sufficient
experience
in
the
development
and
deployment
of
pv
systems
,
and
should
be
capable
of
successfully
implementing
the
proposed
ongrid
on
grid
pv
program
.
as
noted
above
,
sce
has
appointed
a
manager
of
pv
applications
to
strengthen
the
emphasis
on
pv
implementation
.
the
proposed
multidisciplinary
disciplinary
team
includes
personnel
with
experience
in
project
management
,
cost
schedule
development
and
control
,
project
engineering
,
pv
applications
,
system
planning
,
environmental
affairs
,
and
customer
service
.
as
a
major
electric
utility
which
has
successfully
completed
complex
energy
generation
projects
,
sce
has
the
expertise
required
to
perform
all
functions
associated
with
pv
implementation
and
monitoring
in
the
proposed
application
.
in
addition
,
a
project
review
committee
(
prc
)
will
be
established
during
the
initial
project
phase
to
assist
in
technical
,
analysis
,
data
collection
,
and
information
dissemination
issues
.
the
prc
will
have
members
from
sce
,
doe
,
upvg
,
and
national
laboratories
.
the
proposal
has
been
found
to
be
meritorious
as
stated
above
in
the
evaluation
.
the
sce
program
represents
a
unique
approach
to
utility
applications
of
pv
which
has
potential
for
nearterm
near
term
cost
effectiveness
.
sce
has
the
capabilities
and
commitment
to
renewable
energy
sources
which
should
provide
a
basis
for
successful
pv
implementation
in
the
proposed
application
.
the
proposed
project
is
not
eligible
for
financial
assistance
under
a
recent
,
current
,
or
planned
solicitation
.
the
program
cost
is
estimated
to
be
$
5000000
total
,
with
the
doe
share
being
$
2500000
and
the
sce
