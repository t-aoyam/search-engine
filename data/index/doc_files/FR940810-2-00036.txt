about
the

the
department
has
a
policy
to
prepare

for
large

,
such
as
lanl
.
the
purpose
of
a
sweis
is
to
provide
doe
and
its
stakeholders
with
a
comprehensive
look
at
the
environmental
impacts
caused
by
its
operations
and
activities
at
a
site
.
the
nepa
process
allows
for
federal
,
state
,
tribal
,
county
,
municipal
and
public
participation
in
the
environmental
review
and
resultant
decisionmaking
process
.
a
sweis
was
last
prepared
for
lanl
in
1979
[

.
the
planned
sweis
would
replace
that
document
.
a
sweis
is
a
useful
tool
for
doe
to
manage
its
facilities
and
operations
.
it
provides
the
doe
decisionmakers
,
site
management
,
and
the
public
with
comprehensive
information
on
the
cumulative
impact
of
past
,
ongoing
and
planned
activities
at
a
site
in
order
to
plan
for
quality
stewardship
of
the
resources
entrusted
to
does
care
.
a
sweis
can
be
used
to
establish
an
environmentallysound
environmentally
sound
operating
envelope
for
site
activities
and
establish
thresholds
of
significance
to
identify
future
environmental
impacts
.
the
sweis
is
expected
to
support
later
nepa
reviews
by
allowing
doe
to
focus
on
projectspecific
project
specific
issues
and
to
narrow
and
simplify
the
scope
of

this

doe
believes
that
the
sweis
analysis
will
generally
provide
adequate
nepa
coverage
for
those
activities
and
projects
covered
by
the
sweis
.
however
,
a

may
not
replace
the

in

,

will

the

that

may
be

the

anticipates
that
the

will
provide
an

of
all

at

all

related
to
