rationale
for
the
determination
this
notice
of
determination
is
issued
in
response
to
the
courts
remand
.
the
fhwa
has
analyzed
the
courts
decision
and
its
effect
on
the
vision
waiver
study
,
and
has
evaluated
evidence
that
was
not
before
the
court
,
including
considerable
data
gathered
through
the
vision
waiver
study
during
its
two
years
of
operation
.
as
of
09/30/1994
,
there
were
2411
individuals
participating
in
the
vision
waiver
study
.
unless
the
agency
acts
on
the
dc
.
circuit
courts
remand
,
the
waivers
,
without
which
most
of
these
drivers
would
not
be
qualified
,
would
have
to
be
rescinded
immediately
because
the
decision
of
the
court
,
when
mandated
,
will
invalidate
the
existing
rule
authorizing
the
waivers
.
generally
,
a
truck
drivers
ability
to
operate
is
demonstrated
by
possession
of
a
currently
valid
commercial
drivers
license
or
other
authorized
license
,
and
based
upon
other
safetyrelated
safety
related
information
pertaining
to
the
type
of
vehicle
to
be
operated
.
a
commercial
drivers
license
or
other
authorized
license
is
issued
after
subjecting
the
driver
to
knowledge
and
performance
tests
usually
administered
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
.
some
employers
may
add
a
performance
test
,
or
a
safe
driving
probationary
period
before
permanent
employment
.
how
safely
the
driver
may
operate
thereafter
is
based
on
compliance
with
traffic
laws
and
regulations
and
involvement
in
accidents
.
the
drivers
accepted
for
the
waiver
study
had
to
meet
the
licensing
requirement
of
their
states
and
any
employermandated
employer
mandated
prerequisites
,
in
addition
to
demonstrating
beforehand
a
safe
driving
record
for
three
years
as
required
by
the
vision
waiver
program
.
by
allowing
these
drivers
to
continue
to
drive
under
a
waiver
program
,
ie
,
in
effect
,
grandfathering
them
,
the
fhwa
placed
itself
in
the
position
of
receiving
information
on
the
relationship
between
visual
capacity
and
the
ability
to
operate
a
cmv
safely
.
because
they
did
not
meet
existing
vision
standards
,
these
drivers
could
not
be
allowed
to
operate
in
interstate
commerce
,
unless
they
obtained
waivers
.
the
court
acknowledged
that
`
this
approach
may
be
entirely
reasonable
'
but
it
found
that
the
fhwa
lacked
data
to
support
the
conclusion
that
the
conditions
it
imposed
on
the
granting
of
waivers
assured
consistency
with
the
safe
operation
of
cmvs
.
in
order
to
revalidate
the
waivers
,
and
to
remain
consistent
with
the
courts
remand
,
the
fhwa
is
relying
upon
several
research
studies
demonstrating
the
effectiveness
of
methods
to
ascertain
the
probability
of
an
individual
experiencing
accidents
in
the
future
based
on
accident
history
.
the
first
major
effort
in
this
area
was
done
in
england
by
greenwood
and
yule
in
1920
.
subsequent
studies
,
building
on
that
model
,
concluded
that
accident
rates
for
the
same
individual
exposed
to
certain
risks
for
two
different
time
periods
vary
only
slightly
.
(
see
bates
and
neyman
,
university
of
california
publications
in
statistics
,
04/19/1952
)
other
studies
demonstrated
theories
of
predicting
accident
proneness
from
accident
history
coupled
with
other
factors
.
these
factors
,
such
as
age
,
sex
,
geographic
location
,
mileage
driven
and
conviction
history
,
are
used
every
day
by
insurance
companies
and
motor
vehicle
bureaus
to
predict
the
probability
of
an
individual
experiencing
future
accidents
.

a
1964
california
driver
record
study
prepared
by
the
california
department
of
motor
vehicles
concluded
that
the
best
overall
accident
predictor
for
both
concurrent
and
nonconcurrent
events
is
the
number
of
single
convictions
.
this
california
study
used
three
consecutive
years
of
data
,
comparing
the
experience
of
drivers
in
the
first
two
years
with
the
experience
of
those
same
drivers
the
final
year
.

studies
