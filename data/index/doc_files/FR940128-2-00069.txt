proposed

eis
the
proposed
new
tanks
would
provide
waste

needed
for
resolution
of
tank
safety
issues
and
would
not
be
used
for

of

generated

high
level
waste
.
the
new
tanks
would
be
improved
versions
of
the
existing
dsts
.
each
tank
would
be
constructed
of
double
shell
stainless
steel
surrounded
by
a
concrete
liner
,
and
would
have
a
1
million
gallon
capacity
.
all
tanks
would
have
leak
detection
monitoring
systems
and
filtered
ventilation
systems
.
the
eis
will
address
the
construction
of
new
tanks
and
associated
new
transfer
lines
,
and
the
tank
operations
.
for
the
purposes
of
this
interim
action

,
operations
considered
would
be
limited
to
the
retrieval
,
ph
adjustment
or
alkalinity
control
,
and
storage
of
wastes
from
the
watchlist
safety
tanks
.
the
primary
focus
of
the
eis
would
be
the
resolution
of
safety
issues
related
to
the
three
tanks
that
are
on
the
watchlist
because
of
hydrogen
generation
(
241sy101
,
241sy103
and
241an104
,
but
the
tanks
may
also
be
used
to
alleviate
safety
concerns
in
other
watchlist
tanks
(
50
tanks
are
currently
on
the
watchlist
.
further
decisions
regarding
the
disposition
of

alternatives

the

eis
will
evaluate
all
reasonable
alternatives
.
alternatives
which
have
been
tentatively
identified
for
possible
evaluation
in
this
eis
include
but
are
not
limited
to
the
following
:
tpa
preferred
alternative
the
tpa
preferred
alternative
is
to
construct
two
dsts
in
the
200
west
area
by
1997
and
four
dsts
in
the
200
east
area
by
1998
.
these
new
tanks
would
be
utilized
to
store
wastes
retrieved
from
watchlist
tanks
in
order
to
resolve
tank
safety
issues
.
resolution
of
safety
issues
for
these
watchlist
tanks
may
include
up
to
a
threetoone
three
to
one
dilution
of
the
wastes
with
water
and
or
caustic
solutions
.
in
order
to
achieve
this
dilution
a
combination
of
new
and
existing
tank
space
would
be
used
.
construct
fewer
tanks
under
this
alternative
,
the
need
for
additional
tanks
would
be
reduced
using
alternatives
to
retrieval
for
tank
safety
issue
mitigation
.
an
example
would
be
the
use
of
mixer
pumps
for
mitigating
the
flammable
gas
safety
issue
.
no
action
the
eis
will
also
address
the
no
action
alternative
,
under
which
no
additional
underground
highlevel
high
level
waste
storage
tanks
would
be
built
in
the

no

unresolved
