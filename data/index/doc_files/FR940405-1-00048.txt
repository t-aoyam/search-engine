a
number
of
studies
have
suggested
that
ets
exposure
adversely
affects
the
myocardial
oxygen
supplydemand
supply

relationship
;
this
would
predispose
the
heart
to
develop
ischemia
or
exacerbate

ischemia
.
direct
or
indirect
exposure
to
tobacco
smoke
has
been
shown
to
increase
the
hemodynamic
determinants
of
myocardial
oxygen
demand
[
exs

413
,
4242
]
at
the
same
time
that
it
potentially
reduces
both
myocardial
oxygen
supply
and
delivery
by
enhancing
the
development
of
coronary
atherosclerosis
[

4242
,
4323
,
causing
coronary
vasoconstriction
[
exs

4323

and
reducing
the
oxygen
carrying
capacity
of
blood
through

[

as
a
result
,
fewer
red
blood
cells
are
available
to
transport
oxygen
to
the
body
,
and
to
the
heart
muscle
itself
.
to
compensate
for
this
reduced
oxygen
carrying
capacity
of
the
blood
,
the
heart
must
work
harder
,
for
example
,
by
increasing
the
heart
rate
.
this
is
an
example
of
one
mechanism
by
which
ets
may
place
even
further
stress
on
the
heart
by
increasing
myocardial
oxygen
demand
,
precisely
at
a
time
when
the
oxygen
delivery
capabilities
of
the
blood
are
reduced
.
a
second
mechanism
by
which
ets
may
increase
myocardial
oxygen
demand
is
via
the
direct
effect
of
nicotine
.
the
nicotine
in
ets
may
cause
an
increased
resting
heart
rate
and
blood
pressure
in
exposed
individuals
.
one
study
examined
the
effects
of
ets
on
healthy
individuals
during
exercise
,
and
found
that
healthy
individuals
experienced
fatigue
at
lower
work
levels
when
exercising
in
the
presence
of
ets
[
ex
.
4123
.
the
authors
concluded
that
ets
exposure
interfered
with
the
heart
muscle
cells
'
ability
to
utilize
oxygen
for
energy
production
.
consequently
,
ets
exposure
may
have
an
adverse
impact
on
myocardial
metabolism
and
expose
the
heart
muscle
to
an
increased
susceptibility
to
injury
.
these
mechanisms
of
cardiac
stress
and
potential
injury
to
the
heart
are
in
agreement
with
accepted
theories
of
cardiac
