a
student
who
accepts
a
direct
loan
completes
a
promissory
note
and
returns
it
to
the
school
;
the
school
may
not
disburse
direct
loan
funds
without
a
completed
promissory
note
.
an
originating
school
in
the
direct
loan
program
requests
and
obtains
loan
funds
from
the
secretary
using
a
process
similar
to
the
process
for
drawing
down
funds
for
other
department
of
education
(
ed
)
programs
.
the
secretary
adopted
this
process
to
ease
the
burden
on
schools
participating
in
the
direct
loan
program
.
the
direct
loan
program
system
,
however
,
differs
from
the
systems
used
for
other
ed
programs
in
two
ways
.
first
,
a
school
transmits
to
ed
a
specific
direct
loan
funding
request
that
is
separate
from
its
funding
requests
for
other
programs
.
direct
loan
capital
must
be
tracked
separately
and
cannot
be
used
for
purposes
other
than
making
direct
loans
.
the
actual
transmission
request
and
subsequent
electronic
transfer
of
funds
uses
the
same
delivery
process
as
is
used
for
the
federal
pell
grant
program
.
after
a
request
for
funds
is
received
,
the
secretary
uses
the
automated
clearinghouse
(
ach
)
process
through
the
federal
reserve
banking
system
to
deposit
funds
in
a
schools
designated
bank
account
.
currently
,
this
process
takes
between
48
to
72
hours
from
the
schools
request
for
funds
until
the
schools
receipt
of
funds
.
the
second
difference
between
the
direct
loan
program
system
and
the
system
used
for
other
ed
programs
is
that
the
amount
of
loan
capital
needed
by
the
school
is
dependent
on
the
eligibility
of
student
and
parent
borrowers
at
the
school
.
funds
for
the
direct
loan
program
are
not
limited
by
congressional
appropriations
.
as
a
result
,
there
is
no
need
for
a
maximum
funding
level
to
be
authorized
for
a
school
in
the
direct
loan
program
.
the
direct
loan
system
,
however
,
incorporates
internal
fund
controls
to
monitor
school
drawdown
requests
;
these
controls
will
flag
any
requests
that
appear
excessive
.
the
system
also
identifies
schools
that
have
failed
to
comply
with
program
requirements
.
these
flags
result
in
immediate
inquiry
and
intervention
by
the
secretary
.
the
software
provided
by
the
secretary
computes
gross
disbursements
,
loan
fees
,
and
net
disbursements
on
the
basis
of
the
loan
amounts
entered
by
the
school
.
a
school
requests
the
amount
needed
to
fund
net
disbursements
to
borrowers
.
the
secretary
expects
that
schools
will
follow
the
guidelines
for
cash
management
set
out
in
the
blue
book
,
which
is
the
manual
of
accounting
,
recordkeeping
,
and
reporting
requirements
for
postsecondary
educational
institutions
under
the
federallyfunded
federally
funded
student
financial
aid
programs
.
this
notice
requires
any
interest
earned
on
funds
drawn
down
to
be
returned
to
the
secretary
.
for
future
years
,
the
secretary
anticipates
that
issues
related
to
fiscal
control
and
final
accountability
will
be
addressed
in
more
detail
in
negotiated
rulemaking
.
after
receiving
funds
from
the
secretary
,
a
school
disburses
funds
to
students
by
crediting
their
accounts
at
the
school
or
by
sending
checks
to
the
students
.
before
a
school
may
disburse
funds
to
a
borrower
,
the
school
must
ensure
that
it
has
a
completed
and
signed
promissory
note
.
after
the
first
disbursement
is
made
,
the
school
must
record
the
actual
disbursed
amount
and
the
date
of
each
disbursement
in
the
loanorigination
loan
origination
record
and
transmit
all
completed
loan
records
and
promissory
notes
to
the
secretary
.
the
school
transmits
subsequent
disbursement
data
to
the
secretary
as
the
disbursements
occur
.
a
school
is
required
to
reconcile
cash
and
individual
loan
records
monthly
.
to
reconcile
cash
,
a
school
must
provide
documentation
that
the
total
disbursement
minus
cancellations
,
plus
return
of
excess
cash
,
is
equal
to
the
amount
of
money
the
school
has
drawn
down
during
a
onemonth
one
month
period
by
the
end
of
the
next
month
.
for
example
,
loan
records
and
promissory
notes
for
all
disbursements
and
cancellations
made
in
07/19/1994
must
be
transmitted
to
the
secretary
by
the
end
of
08/19/1994
.
to
reconcile
loan
records
,
a
schools
records
must
match
the
records
of
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
.
the
software
that
is
provided
to
participating
schools
is
designed
to
assist
schools
in
this
reconciliation
process
.
b
.
schools
that
use
an
alternative
originator
schools
that
use
an
alternative
originator
transmit
to
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
the
data
necessary
for
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
to
generate
the
combined
promissory
note
disclosure
statement
unless
the
school
chooses
to
print
the
promissory
note
disclosure
statement
on
its
premises
.
after
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
generates
the
promissory
note
disclosure
statement
,
it
is
sent
to
the
school
or
to
the
borrower
depending
upon
the
schools
established
procedures
.
the
borrower
must
complete
the
promissory
note
disclosure
statement
and
forward
it
as
instructed
to
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
or
to
the
school
.
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
must
review
the
promissory
note
disclosure
statement
before
funds
can
be
disbursed
.
if
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
or
the
school
determines
that
the
promissory
note
disclosure
statement
is
not
accurate
or
complete
,
the
promissory
note
disclosure
statement
must
be
correct
and
complete
before
funds
can
be
disbursed
.
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
initiates
drawdown
of
funds
to
the
school
based
on
the
completed
promissory
note
disclosure
statement
.
the
school
also
receives
a
roster
from
the
direct
loan
program
servicer
identifying
each
borrower
,
the
disbursement
date
and
amount
to
be
disbursed
for
each
borrower
,
and
the
total
amount
of
funds
received
by
the
school
.
schools
that
use
alternative
origination
are
still
responsible
for
reporting
actual
disbursement
data
,
reconciling
cash
,
and
returning
funds
that
are
not
used
or
for
which
the
borrower
is
not
eligible
.
