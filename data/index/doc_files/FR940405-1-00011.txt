summary
:
the
fdic
is
proposing
to
rescind
section
3046
of
its
regulations
,
which
currently
requires
all
insured
banks
,
with
the
exception
of
insured
bankers
'
banks
,
to
give
the
fdic
prior
notice
of
planned
rapid
growth
as
a
result
of
any
`
special
funding
plan
or
arrangement
'
for
purposes
of
this
requirement
,
such
a
funding
plan
is
an
effort
to
increase
the
assets
of
a
bank
through
the
solicitation
and
acceptance
of
fully
insured
deposits
obtained
from
or
through
the
mediation
of
brokers
or
affiliates
(
that

insured
brokered
deposits
;
the
solicitation
of
fully
insured
deposits
outside
a
banks
normal
trade
area
;
or
secured
borrowings
,
including
repurchase
agreements

the
proposed
rescission
would
lessen
the
regulatory
burden
on
banks

are
currently
required
to
comply
as
well
with
the
fdics
brokered
deposit
regulation
and
the

rule
,
both
of
which
were
designed
in
part
to
address
the
same
risks
resulting
from

.
the
brokered
deposit
regulation
was
mandated
by
the
financial
institutions
reform
,
recovery
,
and
enforcement
act
of
1989
(
firrea
)
and
amended
to
conform
to
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
improvement
act
of
1991
(
fdicia
.
the
prompt
corrective
action
rule
was
mandated
by

the
rapid
growth
rule
was
not
mandated
by
any
statute

but
was
authorized
by

does
present
special
