another
section
of
the
amended
act
that
affects
wood
furniture
manufacturers
is

183
of

.
section
183a
)
requires
the
epa
to
issue
control
techniques
guidelines
(
ctgs
)
for
11
categories
of
stationary
sources
of
volatile
organic
compound
(
voc
)
emissions
.
the
epa
is
developing
a
ctg
for
the
wood
furniture
manufacturing
industry
as
part
of
the
requirements
of
section
183a
.
the
intent
of
the
ctg
is
to
provide
guidance
to
states
for
regulating
voc
emissions
from
wood
furniture
finishing
,
cleaning
,
and
washoff
operations
at
wood
furniture
manufacturing
facilities
located
in
areas
of
ozone
nonattainment
.
the
ctg
identifies
reasonably
available
control
technology
(
ract
,
which
is
generally
the
minimum
stringency
that
states
apply
to
such
sources
.
the
agency
began
developing
the
ctg
in
the
fall
1989
,
prior
to
initiating
the
neshap
.
the
status
of
the
ctg
and
the
basis
for
selecting
the
regulatory
alternatives
were
presented
to
the
national
air
pollution
control
techniques
advisory
committee
(
napctac
)
in
11/19/1991
at
a
public
meeting
attended
by
industry
and
regulatory
agency
representatives
.
the
ctg
and
the
proposed
neshap
are
concerned
with
two
different
situations
.
the
ctg
provides
guidance
on
regulating
emissions
of
voc
from
wood
furniture
finishing
,
cleaning
,
and
washoff
operations
and
will
likely
affect
only
facilities
located
in
ozone
nonattainment
areas
only
,
while
the
proposed
neshap
will
regulate
emissions
of
hap
from
all
wood
furniture
(
surface
coating
)
operations
nationwide
.
although
the
two
situations
are
different
,
a
source
may
well
be
affected
by
both
.
for
example
,
if
a
wood
furniture
manufacturer
is
:
(
1
)
located
in
an
ozone
nonattainment
area
;
(
2
)
uses
vocs
that
are
on
the
hap
list
;
and
(
3
)
is
a
major
source
of
hap
emissions
and
the
sources
voc
emissions
are
greater
than
the
applicability
level
for
the
ctg
,
the
source
would
be
subject
to
both
the
standards
proposed
herein
and
to
the
ract
requirements
for
vocs
imposed
by
the
state
regulatory
agency
.
due
to
the
potential
overlap
of
this
rule
and
the
ract
requirements
for
vocs
,
the
epa
developed
them
concurrently
so
that
the
requirements
of
the
two
would
be
consistent
.
after
the
bulk
of
the
information
gathering
phase
of
the
ctg
and
the
neshap
was
complete
,
both
the
proposed
rule
and
the
ctg
were
developed
within
the
framework
of
a
regulatory
negotiation
,
described
below
.
todays
rulemaking
proposes
the
neshap
and
identifies
the
rationale
the
regulatory
negotiation
committee
followed
in
developing
it
.
the
epa
plans
to
subsequently
publish
the
ctg
,
including
the
recommended
ract
,
in
a
guidance
document
that
will
be
available
to
all
interested
parties
.
b
.
regulatory
negotiation
approach
the
epa
recognizes
that
there
are
many
issues
and
challenges
in
developing
,
proposing
,
and
promulgating
a
neshap
for
this
source
category
.
during
the
winter
of
1992/1993
,
the
epa
met
with
representatives
of
the
industry
(
including
small
and
large
manufacturers
,
trade
associations
,
finishing
material
suppliers
,
resin
suppliers
,
states
,
and
environmental
groups
at
public
meetings
to
discuss
issues
,
share
information
,
and
assess
whether
a
regulatory
negotiation
would
be
appropriate
for
this
industry
.
two
exploratory
meetings
were
held
for
these
purposes
.
after
the
exploratory
meetings
,
three
public
meetings
were
held
in
spring
and
early
summer
of
1993
to
continue
to
discuss
issues
associated
with
regulatory
development
.
after
publishing
in
the
federal
register
on
06/23/1993
,
a
notice
of
establishment
of
the
regulatory
negotiation
committee
(
58
fr
34011
,
the
first
official
regulatory
negotiation
meeting
was
held
in
07/19/1993
.
formal
meetings
and
informal
workshops
were
held
over
the
next
several
months
to
identify
and
resolve
the
many
issues
associated
with
the
regulation
of
hap
emissions
from
wood
furniture
manufacturing
operations
.
the
committee
members
are
listed
