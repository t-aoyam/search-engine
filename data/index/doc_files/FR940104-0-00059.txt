one
commenter
stated
that
children
are
unlikely
to
consume
sediment
at
the
same
rate
that
they
consume
soil
.
the
agency
agrees
,
but
notes
that
sediment
consumption
by
children
was
not
considered
as
an
exposure
pathway
in
the
proposed
rule
.
the
agency
does
not
feel
that
this
exposure
pathway
is
a
significant
one
in
making
a
determination
whether
or
not
to
list
chlorophenolic
wastes
since
the
exposure
areas
of
concern
are
relatively
small
and
any
land
conversion
which
could
take
place
would
most
likely
require
soil
testing
prior
to
land
development
.
one
commenter
stated
that
the
assumptions
used
to
estimate
the
exposed
population
in
the
soil
ingestion
population
risk
scenario
greatly
overestimate
the
number
of
exposed
children
.
epa
believes
that
the
scenario
may
be
conservative
,
but
not
implausible
.
the
scenario
assumes
that
all
sawmill
sites
are
converted
to
rural
residential
land
use
,
that
the
childrens
play
areas
are
located
on
the
site
of
the
former
storage
yards
,
and
that
the
homes
are
resold
to
new
families
with
young
children
every
25
years
.
these
assumptions
include
a
low
population
density
in
these
areas
.
it
would
take
only
a
limited
number
of
sites
to
be
converted
to
suburban
housing
or
to
daycare
or
school
facilities
to
cause
a
substantial
increase
in
the
exposed
population
.
the
incremental
population
risk
estimated
using
the
corrected
incremental
value
for
the
storage
yard
soil
tcddteq
tcdd
teq
concentration
is
4e7
cases
in
70
years
,
three
orders
of
magnitude
lower
than
that
in
the
proposed
rule
.
one
commenter
maintained
that
the
soil
ingestion
scenario
was
questionable
because
superfund
liabilities
,
state
laws
,
and
lender
requirements
make
land
use
changes
unlikely
without
site
cleanup
activities
.
the
epa
agrees
that
,
in
some
states
,
land
transfers
and
subsequent
land
use
changes
would
be
unlikely
to
occur
without
cleanup
.
however
,
not
all
states
are
equally
diligent
in
requiring
site
investigations
at
the
time
of
property
transfer
,
making
the
types
of
land
use
changes
described
in
the
soil
ingestion
scenario
plausible
.
because
of
this
,
epa
believes
it
is
entirely
appropriate
to
assess
risk
via
the
soil
ingestion
pathway
,
notwithstanding
any
risk
management
decisions
that
may
be
made
at
some
future
time
to
address
the
risk
.
two
commenters
believed
that
some
of
the
values
used
as
input
parameters
to
the
groundwater
ground
water
model
(
(
ie
.
recharge
rate
,
regional
conductivity
,
and
average
depth
to
water
)
were
too
conservative
and
that
more
appropriate
input
parameters
should
be
used
in
this
multimed
model
.
one
commenter
believed
that
the
agency
had
used
drastic
(
a
name
given
to
a
modelling
program
used
to
evaluate
the
potential
which
may
exist
resulting
from
groundwater
pollution
)
to
perform
its
groundwater
modeling
.
first
,
the
epa
did
not
use
the
drastic
model
in
this
rulemaking
effort
;
it
used
the
multimed
model
developed
by
the
agency
to
perform
groundwater
models
.
the
agency
did
,
however
,
use
some
soil
and
hydrogeologic
information
(
on
hydrogeologic
regions
and
subregions
collected
by
aller
et
al
.
(
1988
)
which
is
used
when
applying
the
drastic
model
.
with
regard
to
the
parameters
felt
by
the
commenter
to
be
too
conservative
,
the
epa
supports
the
values
used
in
the
proposed
rule
(
58
fr
at
25706
of
04/27/1993
.
this
hydrogeologic
information
includes
many
of
the
input
parameters
required
to
run
the
multimed
model
,
and
includes
such
parameters
as
depth
to
water
,
soil
type
and
hydraulic
conductivity
,
net
recharge
,
aquifer
hydraulic
conductivity
.
the
epa
selected
hydrogeologic
subregions
in
the
northwest
and
southeast
united
states
,
excluding
subregions
where
sawmills
were
not
likely
to
be
sited
(
(
eg
,
mountain
slopes
or
flanks
.
since
the
parameter
value
ranges
presented
in
aller
et
al
.
(
1988
)
are
based
on
compilations
of
literature
values
and
expert
opinion
,
the
values
should
be
viewed
as
bounding
ranges
,
and
are
not
sufficiently
statistically
rigorous
to
estimate
true
means
or
parameter
distributions
.
for
the
average
case
,
`
typical
'
parameter
values
were
obtained
by
examining
the
ranges
of
values
in
aller
et
al
.
(
1988
)
for
the
selected
subregions
only
and
selecting
values
representing
the
central
tendency
of
the
reported
ranges
.
similarly
,
highend
high
end
values
were
selected
to
represent
the
high
end
of
the
exposure
distribution
,
using
the
higher
end
of
the
range
of
parameter
values
deemed
likely
to
occur
by
aller
et
al
.
(
1988
.
epa
recognizes
that
there
are
limitations
to
this
approach
,
largely
associated
with
the
nonstatistical
statistical
nature
of
the
data
.
the
agency
believes
,
however
,
that
this
data
source
is
the
best
available
at
this
time
for
regional
and
subregional
estimates
of
the
hydrogeologic
properties
necessary
to
estimate
exposures
through
the
groundwater
ground
water
pathway
.
two
commenters
felt
that
the
agencys
use
of
input
parameter
values
used
for
well
location
and
well
intake
point
were
too
conservative
.
epa
derived
the
horizontal
distance
to
wells
from
the
responses
reported
in
the
rcras
3007
industry
questionnaires
.
because
information
was
not
obtained
on
the
well
type
or
construction
,
all
wells
described
in
the
questionnaire
were
assumed
to
be
possible
sources
of
drinking
water
and
were
assumed
to
be
screened
to
the
top
of
the
aquifer
,
that
is
,
well
water
was
assumed
to
be
drawn
off
the
top
of
the
aquifer
where
organics
are
assumed
to
exist
in
greater
concentrations
than
when
water
is
drawn
from
the
middle
of
the
aquifer
.
these
assumptions
are
consistent
with
similar
conservative
assumptions
used
to
develop
other
rcra
regulations
,
such
as
the
toxicity
characteristic
(
55
fr
11798
,
03/29/1990
.
two
commenters
contended
that
neither
biodegradation
or
chemical
degradation
rates
were
considered
in
the
groundwater
ground
water
modeling
of
pentachlorophenol
contamination
.
these
commenters
submitted
studies
showing
that
biological
and
chemical
degradation
of
pcp
can
occur
and
that
adequate
biological
and
chemical
degradation
rates
are
available
or
can
be
estimated
from
these
studies
.
epa
has
reviewed
these
studies
and
agrees
that
they
do
indicate
that
biological
and
chemical
degradation
of
pcp
can
occur
.
the
information
submitted
by
the
commenters
are
results
from
laboratory
studies
,
reporting
the
results
from
controlled
experiments
.
however
,
epa
does
not
agree
that
there
is
sufficient
information
on
unassisted
field
degradation
rates
,
the
geochemical
factors
that
affect
degradation
,
or
their
spatial
variability
from
sitetosite
site
to
site
or
regiontoregion
region
to
region
to
model
degradation
in
the
field
at
generic
or
prototypical
sites
for
regulatory
purposes
.
moreover
,
the
existence
of
metabolites
that
would
confirm
the
occurrence
of
biodegradation
in
the
field
has
not
been
firmly
established
.
therefore
,
epa
does
not
believe
the
data
warrant
an
assumption
that
biodegradation
does
occur
at
significant
rates
at
most
sites
.
in
addition
,
the
toxicities
of
potential
degradation
products
have
not
been
characterized
.
therefore
,
the
epa
does
not
believe
it
is
appropriate
to
consider
these
mechanisms
in
this
rulemaking
.
