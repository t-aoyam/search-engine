implementation
of

no

solid

there
are

associated

.
no
additional

new
types
of
solid
or
hazardous

will
be
generated
.
because
the
compliant
(
higher
solid
)
coatings
are
more
concentrated
,
fewer
containers
will
require
disposal
when
the

volume
of

is
applied

noise
there
is
no

the
source
of
the

of
the

is
not

secondary
air

there
are
no
significant
secondary

use
of
compliant
coatings
avoids
use
of
any
type
of
control
device
or
equipment
that
would
consume
large
amounts
of
energy
.
furthermore
,
any
reduction
in

that
result
from

with
the

reduce

energy
impacts
paint
heaters
are
now
used
in
some
shipyards
.
some
sources
may
use
paint
heaters
in
lieu
of
solvent
to
reduce
paint
viscosity
.
although
some
secondary
air
impacts
would
result
from
the
power
requirements
of
the
electrical
heaters
,
the
amount
of
electricity
that
they
draw
is
insignificant
.
e
.
cost
impacts
the
incremental
nationwide
annual
costs
associated
with
the
proposed
standards
(
mact
cost
minus
baseline
cost
)
is
approximately
$
17
million
per
year
.
the
use
of
compliant
coatings
will
not
require
different
equipment
.
because
lowervoc
lower
voc
(
and
presumably

therefore
,
the

difference
between
the

of

higher

and
the
