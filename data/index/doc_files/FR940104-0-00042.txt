agencies
,
has
been
evaluating
various
alternatives
to

the

published
an
appraisal
report
in
1992
that
identified
and
analyzed
several
alternatives
for
improving
fish
passage
at
the

.
among
the
four
most
reasonable
alternatives
identified
in
the
appraisal
report
,
two
involve
installation
of
a
new
pumping
plant
based
on

archimedes

design
.
the

has
postponed
final
selection
of
a
preferred
alternative
until

are
collected
and
analyzed
from
a
pilot
pumping
plant
that
will
be
constructed
downstream
from
the
dam
in
1994
.
the
pilot
pumping
plant
that
the
bureau
has
proposed
to
install
at
the
dam
will
consist
of
three
large
pumps
to
be
located
on
the
west
bank
of
the
sacramento
river
immediately
downstream
from
the

of
the
pumps
will

the
third
will
be
a
helical

pump
,
with
each
having
approximately
a
100

capacity
.
this
pilot
program
is
intended
to
evaluate
the

design
and
operation
,

to

salmon
from

entering
the
upper
sacramento
river
that
is
contaminated
by
heavy
metals
leached
from
inactive
mining
sites
at
iron
mountain
mine
(
imm
.
heavy
metal
concentrations
from
this
runoff
can
reach
levels
that
are
lethal
to

eggs
and

flows
from

into
the

is
impounded
behind
the

dam
operated
by
the
bureau
.
the
bureau
generally
operates
this
dam
to
control
the
release
of
contaminated
spring
creek
flow
in
conjunction
with
dilution
releases
from
shasta
and
whiskeytown
reservoirs
.
the
bureau
is
expected
to
continue
controlling
releases
from
spring
creek
debris
dam
in
this
manner
until
source
control
and
or
cleanup
can
be
achieved
.
the
environmental
protection
agency
(
epa
)
has
placed
imm
on
the
superfund
priority
list
,
and
the
state
of
california
and
epa
are
continuing
to
evaluate
options
for
the
longterm
long
term
control
of
contaminants
originating
from
the
imm
complex
.
based
on
an
memorandum
of
agreement
between
the
bureau
and
epa
,
the
bureau
will
develop
a
plan
to
enlarge
spring
creek
debris
dam
to
provide
additional
storage
for
imm
effluent
.
epa
also
issued
a
record
of
decision
on
09/30/1992
,
identifying
an
interim
remedial
action
plan
to
clean
up
hazardous
substances
in
the
boulder
creek
operable
unit
at
the
imm
site
.
the
remedial
action
involves
the
collection
and
treatment
of
acid
mine
drainage
discharges
from
the
richmond
and
lawson
portals
at
imm
,
and
the
excavation
and
capping
of
existing
waste
piles
that
are
eroding
and
discharging
into
boulder
creek
and
subsequently
spring
creek
and
the
upper
sacramento
river
.
the
richmond
and
lawson
portals
are
the
two
largest
sources
of
hazardous
materials
at
the
imm
site
and
represent
the
sources
for
nearly
40
percent
of
the
copper
and
80
percent
of
the
cadmium
and
zinc
leached
from
imm
and
discharged
into
tributaries
leading
to
the
sacramento
river
.
in
addition
to
these
activities
,
the
epa
is
moving
forward
with
plans
to
study
several
remaining
sources
of
contamination
at
imm
and
identify
appropriate
remedial
actions
.
the
1993
biological
opinion
to
the
bureau
also
addressed
contamination
from
imm
.
the
opinions
incidental
take
statement
requires
the
bureau
to
operate
spring
creek
debris
dam
and
shasta
dam
so
as
to
minimize
the
chronic
exposure
of
adult
and
juvenile
winterrun
winter
run
chinook
salmon
to
heavy
metal
concentrations
and
eliminate
the
potential
scouring
of
metal
laden
sediments
from
keswick
reservoir
.
