the

postpone

we
are
postponing
the

scope
of
investigation
the
merchandise
covered
by
this
investigation
is
silicomanganese
.
silicomanganese
,
which
is
sometimes
called
ferrosilicon
manganese
,
is
a
ferroalloy
composed
principally
of
manganese
,
silicon
,
and
iron
,
and
normally
containing
much
smaller
proportions
of
minor
elements
,
such
as
carbon
,
phosphorous
and
sulfur
.
silicomanganese
generally
contains
by
weight
not
less
than
4
%
iron
,
more
than
30
%
manganese
,
more
than
8
%
silicon
and
not
more
than
3
%
phosphorous
.
all
compositions
,
forms
and
sizes
of
silicomanganese
are
included
within
the
scope
of
these
investigations
,
including
silicomanganese
slag
,
fines
and
briquettes
.
silicomanganese
is
used
primarily
in
steel
production
as
a
source
of
both
silicon
and
manganese
.
these
investigations
cover
all
silicomanganese
,
regardless
of
its
tariff
classification
.
most
silicomanganese
is
currently
classifiable
under
subheading
720230
0000
of
the
harmonized
tariff
schedule
of
the
united
states
(
htsus
.
some
silicomanganese
may
also
be
classifiable
under
htsus
subheading
720299

although
the
htsus
subheading
is
provided
for
convenience
and
customs
purposes

the

has
considered

to
be

.
ukraine
has
not
contested
this
designation
,
and
we
are
continuing
to
consider
it
a
nme
country
.
therefore
,
in
accordance
with
section
773c
)
of
the
act
,
the
department
has
based
foreign

value
on
factors

,
and
has
valued
the
factors

surrogate
values
from

countries
that
are
at
a
level
of
economic
development
comparable
to
that
of
ukraine
,
and
that
are
significant
producers
of
comparable
merchandise
.
due
to
dramatic
and
ongoing
changes
in
ukraines
economy
,
we
were
not
able
to
identify
a
single
preferred
surrogate
country
for
ukraine
.
therefore
,
we
have
ranked
groups
of
surrogates
into
three
tiers
:
egypt
,
colombia
,
morocco
,
and
peru
,
which
we
determined
were
most
similar
to
ukraine
in
per

gnp
and
population
size
,
were
assigned
to
tier
one
;
ecuador
,
guatemala
,
bolivia
,
the
dominican
republic
,
and
indonesia
were
placed
in
tier
two
;
and
finally
,
the
philippines
and
el
salvador
were
included
in
tier
three
.

it
should
be
noted
that
although
the
tiers
are
ranked
hierarchically
,
the
surrogate

are
not
hierarchically
ranked
within
each

.
we

in
some
instances
,
we
were
able
to
obtain
surrogate
values
for
a
particular
factor
of
production
from
only
one
country
.
where
surrogate
values
were
available
from
more
than
one
country
within
a
tier
,
we
averaged
the
pricing
data
for
all
of
the
countries
.
we
then
used
the
average
price
for
that
tier
to
value
the
factor
of
production
.
for
purposes
of
this
preliminary
determination
,
we
determined
that
this
was
the
most
objective
method
given
that
there
was
no
basis
for
distinguishing
