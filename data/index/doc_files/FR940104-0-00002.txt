will
not
preempt
any
state

laws

or
policies
,
unless
they
present
an
irreconcilable
conflict
with
this
action
.
the
act
provides
that

proceedings
must
be
exhausted
before
parties
may
file
suit
in

under
section

)
of
the
act

any

file
with

a
petition
stating
that

any
provision
of
the

or
any
obligation
imposed

the
purpose

the
rfa
is
to
fit
regulatory
actions

the

that
small

not
be
unduly
or
disproportionately
burdened
.
marketing
orders
issued
pursuant
to
the
act
,
and
rules
issued
thereunder
,
are
unique
in
that
they
are
brought
about
through
group
action
of
essentially
small
entities
acting
on
their
own
behalf
.
thus
,
both
statutes
have
small
entity
orientation
and
compatibility
.
