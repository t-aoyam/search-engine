this
mandatory
appendix
specifies
the
procedure
for
analyzing
air
samples
for
asbestos
,
tremolite
,
anthophyllite
,
and
actinolite
and
specifies
quality
control
procedures
that
must
be
implemented
by
laboratories
performing
the
analysis
.
the
sampling
and
analytical
methods
described
below
represent
the
elements
of
the
available
monitoring
methods
(
such
as

b
to
this

the
most
current
version
of
the
osha
method
id60
,
or
the
most
current
version
of
the
niosh
7400
method
)
which
osha
considers
to
be
essential
to
achieve
adequate
employee
exposure
monitoring
while
allowing
employers
to
use
methods
that
are
already
established
within
their
organizations
.
all
employers
who
are
required
to
conduct
air
monitoring
under
paragraph
(
f
)
of
this
section
are
required
to
utilize
analytical
laboratories
that
use
this
procedure
,
or
an
equivalent
method

for
collecting
and
analyzing

the
sampling
medium
for

samples
shall
be
mixed

these
shall
be
designated
by
the
manufacturer
as
suitable
for
asbestos

,
anthophyllite
,
and
actinolite
counting
.

the
preferred

device
shall
be
the
25mm
diameter
cassette
with
an
openfaced
open

50mm
extension

.
the
37mm
cassette
may
be
used
if
necessary
but
only
if

to

an
air
flow
rate
between
05
liter

and
25
liters
min
shall
be
selected
for
the
25mm
cassette
.
if
the
37mm
cassette
is
used
,
an
air
flow
rate
between
1
liter

min
shall
be
selected
.

.
where
possible
,
a
sufficient
air
volume
for
each
air
sample
shall
be
collected
to
yield
between
100
and
1300
fibers
per
square
millimeter
on
the
membrane
filter
.
if
a
filter
darkens
in
appearance
or
if
loose
dust
is
seen
on
the
filter
,
a
second
sample
shall
be
started
.
5
.
ship
the
samples
in
a
rigid
container
with
sufficient
packing
material
to
prevent
dislodging
the
collected
fibers
.
packing
material
that
has
a
high
electrostatic
charge
on
its
surface
(
eg
,
expanded
polystyrene
)
cannot
be
used
because
such
material
can
cause
loss
of
fibers
to
the
sides
of
the
cassette
.
6
.
calibrate
each
personal
sampling
pump
before
and
after
use
with
a
representative
filter
cassette
installed
between
the
pump
and
the
calibration
devices
.
7
.
personal
samples
shall
be
taken
in
the
`
breathing
zone
'
of
the
employee
(
ie
,
attached
to
or
near
the
collar
or
lapel
near
the
workers

.
8
.
fiber
counts
shall
be
made
by
positive
phase
contrast
using
a
microscope
with
an
8

10

eyepiece
and
a
40

for
a
total
magnification
of
approximately
400

and
a
numerical
aperture
of

the
microscope
shall
also
be
fitted
with

the

of

be
about
3

bring
the
blocks
of
grooved
lines
into
focus
.
note
:
the
slide
consists
of
seven
sets
of
grooved
lines
(
ca

20
grooves
to
each
block
)
in
descending
order
of
visibility
from
sets
1
to
7
,
seven
being
the
least
visible
.
the
requirements
for
asbestos
,
tremolite
,
anthophyllite
,
and
actinolite
counting
are
that
the
microscope
optics
must
resolve
the
grooved
lines
in
set
3
completely
,
although
they
may
appear
somewhat
faint
,
and
that
the
grooved
lines
in
sets
6
and
7
must
be
invisible
.
sets
4
and
5
must
be
at
least
partially
visible
but
may
vary
slightly
in
visibility
between
microscopes
.
a
microscope
that
fails
to
meet
these
requirements
has
either
too
low
or
too
high
a
resolution
to
be
used
for
asbestos
,
tremolite
,
anthophyllite
,
and
actinolite
counting
.

the
problem
persists
