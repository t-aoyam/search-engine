eighty
one
commenters
addressed
the
issue
regarding
the
classification
of
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
according
to
bone
solids
content
.
of
the
81
commenters
,
78
disagreed
with
the
requirements
discussed
in
the
anpr
which
tentatively
considered
that
only
product
with
06
percent
or
less
bone
solids
content
could
be
labeled
`
kind
'
or
`
kind
)
meat
'
without
the
reference
to
`
mechanically
separated
'
the
commenters
stated
that
the
establishment
of
a
06
percent
bone
solids
content
demarcation
between
what
would
be
labeled
as
`
kind
'
or
`
kind
)
meat
'
and
`
mechanically
separated
(
kind
'
based
on
data
collected
in
08/19/1993
(
data
presented
by
fsis
in
the
report
entitled
`
determination
of
acceptable
limits
of
percent
bone
solids
in
ground
poultry
products
)
would
basically
eliminate
half
of
the
currently
produced
product
and
reduce
the
available
amount
of
this
low
cost
poultry
ingredient
for
further
processed
poultry
and
meat
food
products
by
60
to
70
percent
.
moreover
,
commenters
further
emphasized
that
,
to
operate
within
the
current
1
percent
bone
solids
content
limit
for
boneless
poultry
,
most
processors
must
target
their
operations
at
about
06
percent
bone
solids
content
.
the
commenters
indicated
that
achievement
of
the
low
levels
of
percent
bone
solids
content
that
were
reported
by
fsis
in
the
report
of
the
august
1993
data
occurred
because
it
is
necessary
for
producers
to
target
well
below
the
current
1
percent
limit
in
order
to
consistently
meet
and
not
exceed
the
1
percent
requirement
.
thus
,
setting
a
requirement
at
06
percent
for
what
could
be
called
`
kind
'
or
`
kind
)
meat
'
would
require
producers
to
aim
at
significantly
lower
levels
of
bone
solids
content
which
would
present
an
unreasonable
burden
on
the
industry
.
manufacturers
would
have
to
adjust
their
mechanical
deboning
machines
to
adjust
the
pressure
needed
to
force
ground
poultry
bones
with
adhering
muscle
and
other
tissues
through
screens
in
the
mechanical
deboning
equipment
to
eliminate
more
bone
from
the
finished
product
,
thereby
reducing
product
yield
.
according
to
the
commenters
,
in
order
to
label
a
product
as
`
chicken
'
or
`
turkey
meat
'
ie
,
to
meet
the
`
upper
control
limit
'
of
06
percent
,
a
processor
would
have
to
target
a
03
percent
bone
solids
content
level
to
qualify
for
that
product
category
because
of
the
lack
of
precise
controls
in
the
operation
of
the
deboning
equipment
.
one
commenter
claimed
that
industry
data
submitted
to
the
agency
`
shows
,
under
the
principles
of
statistical
process
control
,
a
controlled
process
that
targets
06
percent
bone
solids
will
result
in
a
product
that
meets
the
1
percent
bone
solids
requirement
995
percent
of
the
time
'
another
commenter
claimed
that
the
industry
data
presented
indicate
that
the
average
percent
bone
solids
content
is
0
57
percent
with
a
standard
deviation
of
0
227
percent
,
so
that
`
at
the
99
percent
confidence
limit
,
evidence
that
a
process
may
not
be
running
efficiently
is
when
an
individual
sample
analysis
is
greater
than
1
15
percent
'
therefore
,
according
to
the
commenters
,
the
agency
is
wrong
to
advocate
an
average
bone
solids
content
of
06
percent
as
the
current
measure
of
good
manufacturing
practices
for
poultry
products
produced
by
mechanical
separation
.
the
same
commenters
criticized
the
fsis
report
on
bone
solids
content
stating
that
`
no
statistical
analysis
,
factorial
or
otherwise
,
was
done
to
describe
the
two
categories
of
mechanically
separated
poultry
based
on
bone
solids
content
to
determine
if
,
in
fact
,
they
are
different
and
or
whether
members
of
the
populations
were
in
fact
similar
'
the
commenters
further
asserted
that
the
data
presented
by
fsis
did
not
actually
demonstrate
that
two
`
categories
'
of
mechanically
separated
poultry
exist
.
the
commenters
asserted
that
such
an
analysis
may
show
that
the
only
difference
was
due
to
the
type
of
starting
materials
(
eg
,
necks
versus
carcass
frames
versus
backs
)
or
that
there
are
,
in
fact
,
no
separable
populations
.
further
,
it
was
asserted
by
several
commenters
that
the
usual
practice
in
quality
control
is
to
use
3
standard
deviations
above
a
target
criteria
as
a
control
limit
,
rather
than
the
standard
deviation
of
2
33
(
corresponding
to
a
99
percent
confidence
that
the
process
is
not
in
control
,
as
was
suggested
by
fsis
in
its
report
of
the
1993
study
.
one
commenter
provided
an
example
of
how
the
3
standard
deviations
approach
would
be
applied
.
it
was
explained
that
since
the
mean
percent
bone
solids
content
presented
in
the
report
of
the
1993
study
was
0
68
percent
and
that
the
average
standard
deviation
by
establishment
was
0
138
,
then
3
standard
deviations
above
the
mean
control
limit
would
be
approximately
11
percent
bone
solids
content
.
