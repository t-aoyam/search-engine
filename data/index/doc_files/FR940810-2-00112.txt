investment
partnerships
and
corporations
.
the
interpretation
,
under
`
investment
partnerships
and
corporations
'
generally
disallows
sales
of
a
hot
issue
to
an
investment
partnership
or
corporation
,
or
similar
account
(
investment
partnership
)
if
a
restricted
person
has
a
beneficial
interest
in
the
entity
.
thus
,
an
investment
partnership
with
several
limited
partners
would
be
`
tainted
'
due
to
the
limited
partnership
interest
of
the
restricted
person
.
in
08/19/1992
and
10/19/1993
notices
to
members
,
the
nasd
announced
it
was
going
to
allow
investment
partnerships
,
on
an
interim
basis
,
to
use
a
`
carve
out
'
mechanism
to
prevent
restricted
persons
with
an
interest
in
an
investment
partnership
from
participating
in
hot
issue
allocations
.
this
`
carve
out
'
mechanism
requires
the
nasd
member
making
such
allocation
to
set
up
a
separate
account
for
these
transactions
and
obtain
from
the
investment
partnership
and
its
accountants
documentation
that
indicates
that
the
restricted
persons
are
prevented
from
participating
in
a
hot
issue
allocation
.
the
nasd
believes
that
the
carveout
carve
out
methodology
is
the
most
equitable
and
appropriate
approach
for
investment
partnerships
in
which
restricted
persons
have
a
beneficial
interest
,
and
that
the
carveout
carve
out
procedure
should
be
codified
as
proposed
under
the
beneficial
interest
section
of
the
interpretation
.
the
carveout
carve
out
procedure
would
not
allow
a
person
restricted
under
the
interpretation
to
receive
a
hot
issue
allocation
inconsistent
with
the
interpretations
provisions
;
but
would
also
not
inequitably
penalize
those
not
restricted
under
the
interpretation
due
to
their
interest
in
an
investment
partnership
in
which
a
restricted
person
also
has
an
interest
.
a
typical
scenario
is
where
a
limited
partnership
with
a
large
number
of
limited
partners
is
restricted
under
the
interpretation
because
one
of
the
limited
partners
is
an
officer
of
an
insurance
company
,
and
therefore
restricted
under
paragraph
4
of
the
interpretation
.
rather
than
restricting
the
whole
limited
partnership
,
the
carveout
carve
out
procedure
would
allow
the
limited
partnership
to
purchase
the
hot
issue
by
properly
allocating
the
hot
issue
away
from
the
restricted
limited
partner
according
to
the
specified
requirements
proposed
.
in
addition
,
the
nasd
believes
that
a
beneficial
interest
,
as
defined
under
the
interpretation
,
should
not
be
created
by
the
receipt
of
a
management
fee
based
on
the
performance
of
an
account
.
the
nasd
believes
that
investment
partnerships
and
other
similar
accounts
typically
require
that
the
management
fee
structure
of
such
accounts
include
a
performancebased
performance
based
component
.
thus
,
an
investment
advisor
restricted
under
paragraph
4
of
the
interpretation
could
restrict
an
entire
investment
partnership
,
in
which
no
restricted
persons
have
an
interest
,
based
solely
on
the
investment
advisor
receiving
a
fee
based
on
the
performance
of
the
securities
in
the
investment
partnership
account
.
the
beneficial
interest
provision
of
the
interpretation
is
intended
to
address
those
accounts
in
which
a
restricted
person
has
a
substantive
,
albeit
not
necessarily
direct
ownership
,
interest
that
should
be
appropriately
restricted
.
the
nasd
believes
that
the
receipt
of
a
performancebased
performance
based
fee
,
without
the
existence
of
any
other
beneficial
interest
,
should
not
create
such
an
interest
.

.
definition
of
public
offering
.
in
its
present
form
,
the
interpretations
definition
of
a
public
offering
includes
virtually
any
and
all
distributions
of
securities
,
whether
registered
or
unregistered
under
the
securities
act
.
the
nasd
has
found
that
the
definition
has
had
the
unintended
effect
of
implicating
the
interpretations
restrictions
for
bona
fide
private
placements
of
securities
which
do
not
present
the
potential
abuses
that
the
interpretation
is
intended
to
guard
against
.
the
nasd
believes
that
the
proposed
modification
to
the
definition
,
which
in
essence
does
not
apply
the
interpretation
to
a
traditional
private
placement
of
securities
,
is
appropriate
because
such
distributions
generally
are
limited
in
scope
and
have
holding
periods
placed
on
the
privately
placed
securities
.
thus
,
the
nasd
believes
that
such
placements
should
not
be
within
the
purview
of
the
interpretation
in
that
distribution
is
limited
and
that
the
potential
for
restricted
persons
to
purchase
the
securities
and
resell
or
`
flip
'
them
in
a
short
period
of
time
is
limited
due
to
the
resale
restrictions
placed
on
such
offerings
.

associated
person
definition
.
article
i
,
section
(
m
)
of
the
nasd
bylaws
by
laws
defines
a
`
person
associated
with
a
member
'
to
include
a
partner
of
a
broker
dealer
and
any
person
who
is
directly
or
indirectly
controlling
or
controlled
by
such
member
,
whether
or
not
such
person
is
registered
with
the
association
.
the
nasd
has
found
that
a
certain
degree
of
confusion
exists
as
to
the
status
of
passive
investors
in
broker
dealers
,
such
as
broker
dealer
limited
partners
,
equity
owners
,
or
subordinated
lenders
.
the
nasd
believes
,
that
under
certain
circumstances
,
such
persons
should
not
be
considered
persons
associated
with
a
broker
dealer
due
to
their
limited
,
passive
investment
in
a
broker
dealer
.
thus
,
the
nasd
has
proposed
that
if
a
person
owns
or
has
contributed
10
%
or
less
to
a
broker
dealers
capital
,
such
person
should
not
be
construed
to
be
an
associated
person
;
provided
that
,
such
ownership
interest
is
a
passive
investment
,
the
person
does
not
receive
hot
issues
from
the
member
in
which
she
has
the
interest
,
and
that
the
broker
dealer
is
not
in
a
position
to
direct
hot
issues
to
the
person
.
the
nasd
believes
that
the
limitations
placed
on
such
persons
in
order
not
to
be
considered
associated
persons
will
prevent
the
same
from
attempting
to
use
their
ownership
interests
in
a
broker
dealer
to
effect

purchase
of

issues
,
and
circumvent

persons
associated
with
limited
business
broker
dealers
.
similar
to
the
status
of
persons
with
a
limited
ownership
interest
in
a
broker
dealer
,
the
nasd
believes
that
persons
associated
with
certain
broker
dealers
that
transact
a
limited
securities
business
should
also
not
be
restricted
as
other
associated
persons
under
paragraph
2
of
the
interpretation
.
specifically
,
the
nasd
proposes
that
persons
associated
with
broker
dealers
whose
business
is
limited
to
direct
participation
programs
or
investment
company
variable
product
securities
not
be
restricted
under
the
interpretation
to
the
same
extent
as
those
persons
associated
with
broker
dealers
with
a
more
comprehensive
securities
business
.
typically
,
a
broker
dealers
business
is
limited
pursuant
to
a
restrictive
agreement
executed
by
the
member
as
a
condition
to
its
membership
in
the
association
.
in
that
persons
associated
with
such
limited
broker
dealers
are
not
in
a
position
to
sell
,
distribute
,
or
withhold
hot
issue
securities
,
the
nasd
does
not
believe
that
such
persons
would
be
in
a
position
to
inhibit
a
bona
fide
distribution
of
a
hot
issue
security
.
the
nasd
notes
that
the
proposed
modification
applies
only
to
a
person
associated
with
such
a
limited
broker
dealer
,
and
not
to
the
broker
dealer
itself
.
the
nasd
does
not
believe
that
it
is
appropriate
for
any
nasd
member
to
purchase
a
hot
issue
security
for
its
own
account
,
regardless
of
the
extent
of
its
securities
business
.

issuer
directed
securities
.
presently
,
an
employee
of
an
issuer
,
who
also
is
restricted
under
the
interpretation
,
must
receive
permission
from
the
nasd
board
of
governors
in
order
to
purchase
hot
issue
securities
of
its
employer
,
if
the
employee
does
not
have
the
requisite
investment
history
with
the
nasd
member
making
the
securities
distribution
.
for
example
,
an
employee
of
a
manufacturing
company
who
is
married
to
the
senior
officer
of
a
bank
would
be
restricted
under
the
interpretation
because
he
or
she
is
the
immediate
family
member
of
a
restricted
person
under
paragraph
3
of
the
interpretation
.
under
the
proposed
changes
to
paragraph
3
of
the
interpretation
,
the
employee
would
still
be
restricted
if
the
senior
officer
of
the
bank
directly
or
indirectly
supports
the
employee
.
if
permission
is
granted
by
the
board
of
governors
,
the
employee
is
allowed
to
purchase
the
securities
of
the
employer
without
meeting
the
investment
history
requirement
,
but
the
amount
purchased
would
still
have
to
meet
the
insubstantial
and
not
disproportionate
tests
described
above
.
the
nasd
believes
that
it
is
inequitable
to
impose
such
restrictions
on
employees
of
issuers
who
are
in
most
cases
tangentially
restricted
under
the
interpretation
,
in
connection
with
their
purchase
of
securities
issued
by
their
employer
.
the
nasd
notes
that
issuerdirected
issuer
directed
share
programs
are
viewed
as
a
valuable
tool
in
employee
development
and
retention
,
and
does
not
believe
that
the
objectives
of
the
interpretation
are
furthered
by
imposing
essentially
the
same
restrictions
on
such
purchases
as
those
not
involving
an
employer
employee
relationship
.
thus
,
the
proposed
modifications
to
the
issuer
directed
securities
section
of
the
interpretation
will
allow
employees
of
issuers
to
purchase
hot
issue
securities
of
the
employer
under
the
same
terms
and
conditions
as
persons
associated
with
nasd
members
are
permitted
in
connection
with
purchases
of
securities
issued
by
the
member
,
pursuant
to
an
exemption
provided
in
