objectives
.
the
primary
objectives
of
this
standard
are
:
_
to
allow
very
highly
interactive
graphics
application
programs
using
2d
or
3d
hierarchically
structured
graphics
data
to
be
easily
transported
between
installations
.
this
will
reduce
costs
associated
with
the
transfer
of
programs
among
different
computers
and
graphic
devices
,
including
replacement
devices
.
_
to
aid
the
understanding
and
use
of
dynamic
hierarchical
graphics
methods
by
application
programmers
.
_
to
aid
manufacturers
of
graphics
equipment
by
serving
as
a
guideline
for
identifying
useful
combinations
of
graphics
capabilities
in
a
device
.
_
to
encourage
more
effective
utilization
and
management
of
graphics
application
programmers
by
ensuring
that
skills
acquired
on
one
job
are
transportable
to
other
jobs
,
thereby
reducing
the
cost
of
graphics
programmer
retraining
.
_
to
aid
graphics
application
programmers
in
understanding
and
using
graphics
methods
by
specifying
welldefined
well
defined
functions
and
names
.
this
will
avoid
the
confusion
of
incompatibility
common
with
operating
systems
and
programming
languages
.

applicability
.
phigs
is
one
of
the
computer
graphics
standards
(
appendix
a
discusses
the
family
of
computer
graphics
standards
)
provided
for
use
by
all
federal
departments
and
agencies
.
these
graphics
standards
should
be
used
for
all
computer
graphics
applications
and
programs
that
are
either
developed
or
acquired
for
government
use
.
91
the
fips
for
phigs
is
intended
for
use
in
computer
graphics
applications
that
are
either
developed
or
acquired
for
government
use
.
it
is
specifically
designed
to
meet
the
performance
requirements
of
such
demanding
applications
as
computer
aided
design
computer
aided
engineering
computer
aided
manufacturing
,
command
and
control
,
molecular
modelling
,
simulation
and
process
control
.
it
emphasizes
the
support
of
applications
needing
a
highly
dynamic
,
highly
interactive
operator
interface
and
expecting
rapid
screen
update
of
complex
images
to
be
performed
by
the
display
system
.
the
phigs
plus
functionality
is
designed
to
support
graphics
applications
requiring
lighting
and
shading
,
curved
lines
,
curved
and
facetted
surfaces
,
and
nonindexed
indexed
color
specification
.
92
the
use
of
this
standard
is
compulsory
and
binding
when
one
or
more
of
the
following
situations
exist
:
_
the
graphics
application
is
very
highly
interactive
,
or
contains
hierarchically
structured
graphics
data
,
or
requires
rapid
modification
of
2d
or
3d
graphics
data
and
the
relationships
among
the
data
.
_
it
is
anticipated
that
the
life
of
the
graphics
program
will
be
longer
than
the
life
of
the
presently
utilized
graphics
equipment
.
_
the
graphics
application
or
program
is
under
constant
review
for
updating
of
the
specifications
,
and
changes
may
result
frequently
.
_
the
graphics
application
is
being
designed
and
programmed
centrally
for
a
decentralized
system
that
employs
computers
of
different
makes
and
models
and
different
graphic
devices
.
_
the
graphics
program
will
or
might
be
run
on
equipment
other
than
that
for
which
the
program
is
initially
written
.
_
the
graphics
program
is
to
be
understood
and
maintained
by
programmers
other
than
the
original
ones
.
_
the
graphics
program
is
or
is
likely
to
be
used
by
organizations
outside
the
federal
government
(
(
ie
,
state
and
local
governments
,
and
others
.
