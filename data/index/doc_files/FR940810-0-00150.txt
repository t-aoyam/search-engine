decades
long
impasses
in

have

it

to
be
borne
in

by
the
specific
employer
responsible
for
the
risk

for
firms
using
insurance
,
the
premium
determination
process
is
such
that
premiums
only
partially
reflect
changes
in
risk
associated
with
changes
in
asbestos
or
other
hazardous
exposures
.
this
results
in
the
socalled
so
called
`
moral
hazard
problem
'
which
is
the
risk
that
arises
from
the
possible
dishonesty
or
imprudence
of
the
insured
.
as
the
insured
has
paid
for
an
insurance
company
to
assume
some
of
his
or
her
risks
,
he
or
she
has
less
reason
to
exercise
the
diligence
necessary
to
avoid

this
transfer
of

is
a

the

system
came
about
as
the
result

perceived
inadequacies
in

systems
to
compel
employers
to
prevent

compensate
workers

was
designed
to
internalize
some
of

in

it

fallen

initial
exposure
limits
for

were
based
on
efforts

reduce

which
was
known
to
be
associated
with

exposure

the
reduction
in

of

,
resulted
in

to

that
are
now

the
