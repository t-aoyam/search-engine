regulatory
flexibility
analysis
the
proposed
iaq
standard
will
affect
numerous
small
establishments
and
a
portion
of
these
establishments
may
have
difficulty
financing
the
compliance
actions
needed
to
comply
depending
on
which
alternative
they
choose
.
this
section
examines
the
potential
for
exceptional
impacts
among
small
establishments
.
the
nature
of
compliance
action
limits
the
potential
for
exceptionally
large
compliance
burdens
on
small
businesses
because
most
costs
will
be
incurred
on
a
per
employee
or
per
square
foot
basis
.
the
number
of
buildings
occupied
with
establishments
with
fewer
than
20
employees
is
estimated
at
37
million
or
82
percent
of
all
buildings
.
of
these
,
76
percent
have
floor
space
less
than
10000
square
feet
.
thus
,
small
firms
will
incur
low
costs
because
they
have
small
floorspace
and
few
employees
.
to
this
point
of
the
analysis
,
osha
has
not
distributed
the
number
of
buildings
across
establishments
since
there
are
no
data
on
which
to
describe
the
establishments
in
multitenant
tenant
buildings
.
therefore
,
osha
developed
establishment
specific
compliance
costs
based
on
the
estimates
presented
in
section
e
of
this
report
.
the
economic
impact
by
firm
size
is
estimated
with
the
assumption
that
all
establishments
will
require
hvac
maintenance
.
it
was
assumed
that
each
establishment
has
a
floor
space
of
10000
square
feet
.
to
examine
the
potential
regulatory
burden
that
would
be
experienced
by
small
establishments
,
osha
calculated
the
ratio
of
their
annual
compliance
cost
to
their
sales
and
pretax
tax
profit
for
two
scenarios
for
dealing
with
ets
:
(
1
)
provide
designated
smoking
areas
,
or
(
2
)
totally
ban
smoking
in
the
workplace
.
as
shown
in
table
vi14
,
for
both
scenarios
,
the
average
ratio
of
compliance
costs
to
sales
ranges
from
0
44
percent
to
0
52
percent
.
the
highest
impact
(
2
79
percent
)
for
establishments
not
banning
smoking
would
be
in
personal
services
(
sic72
sic
.
estimates
of
compliance
cost
as
a
percentage
of
pretax
tax
profits
were
less
than
7
05
percent
for
most
sectors
;
social
services
establishments
(
sic83
sic
)
would
experience
the
largest
reduction
in
profit
(
31
percent
,
if
they
allow
smoking
in
designated
rooms
.
these
estimates
apply
to
the
average
firm
in
each
sector
.
the
degree
to
which
affected
firms
will
either
incur
or
shift
compliance
costs
depends
largely
on
the
competitive
environment
in
which
the
establishments
operate
and
on
the
elasticity
of
demand
for
the
establishments
services
and
commodities
.
osha
requests
information
regarding
compliance
costs
against
indicators
of
the
demand
for
and
the
costs
of
the
types
of
services
and
commodities
provided
by
establishments
which
would
be
affected
by
the
proposed
standard
.
osha
specifically
requests
comments
,
including
empirical
data
regarding
the
demand
elasticity
of
such
establishments
'
patrons
who
will
not
be
permitted
to
smoke
in
the
presence
of
employees
at
such
establishments
.
if
economic
feasibility
is
shown
to
be
an
issue
for
establishments
such
as
bars
and
restaurants
,
what
methods
of
compliance
would
adequately
protect
workers
in
a
feasible
manner
?
