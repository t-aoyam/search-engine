innovative

council
,
comprised
of
epa
management
and
staff
from

has

.
the
council
recognizes
a
need
to
accelerate
the
development
,
commercialization
,
and
use
of
innovative
environmental
technologies
to
maintain
and
improve
environmental
quality
at
home
and
abroad
into
the
21st
century
.
environmental
quality
would
deteriorate
,
given
foreseeable
population
growth
and
industrialization
,
unless
technology
is
developed
and
more
broadly
applied
,
that
is
more
effective
in
preventing
and
reducing
pollution
levels
,
less
costly
than
existing
technology
and
supportive
of
sustainable
development
.
epa
,
state
and
local
agencies
are
in
a
unique
position
to
influence
the
rate
and
focus
of
environmental
technology
innovation
and
use
because
of
their
legislative
and
programmatic
mandates
and
regulatory
responsibilities
(
which
often
influence
the
demand
for
environmental

,

epas
draft
strategy
provides
a
plan
to
directly
and
indirectly
support
private
sector
innovation
and
diffusion
activities
sponsored
by
the
public
and
private
sector
and
close
coordination
among
federal
agencies
.
it
focuses
on
creating
incentives
for
the
development
and
use
of
innovative
technologies
in
federal
and
state
environmental
regulations
,
reducing
barriers
to
technology
innovation
and
use
,
and
improving
the
competitiveness
of
the
environmental
technology
industry
in
domestic
and
international
markets
.
epa
and
other
federal
,
state
and
local
agencies
,
universities
,
trade
associations
and
consortia
,
and
numerous
private
companies
are
already
working
in
many
of
the
areas
identified
in
the
strategy
.
epa
is
seeking
public
comment
on
the
strategy
to
focus
and
target
efforts
to
accelerate
environmental
technology
development
,
commercialization
and
use
.
the
agencys
innovative
technology
council
plans
to
revise
and
update
the
strategy
based
on
the
comments
received
.
the
definition
of
`
environmental
technologies
'
being
addressed
in
the
strategy
varies
widely
for
a
number
of
reasons
.
the
`
environmental
technology
industry
'
has
only
recently
become
a
focal
point
for
market
analysts
and
policymakers
policy
makers
,
and
it
is
highly
diversified
in
terms
of
the
current
demand
for
and
supply
of
technologies
,
goods
and
services
.
demand
often
varies
based
on
local
environmental
conditions
.
`
environmental
technologies
'
include
technologies
,
goods
,
and
services
whose
development
is
triggered
primarily
by
environmental
improvement
objectives
.
sometimes
referred
to
as
`
dark
green
'
technologies
,
these
include
:
products
and
services
to
monitor
and
assess
pollutant
releases
and
exposure
levels
;
innovative
technologies
which
prevent
pollution
,
control
air
and
water
pollution
levels
,
and
remediate
contaminated
soil
and
groundwater
;
and
,
manage
environmental
data
.
epas
strategy
also
addresses
`
light
green
'
technologies
that
are
developed
primarily
for
nonenvironmental
environmental
reasons
;
those
technologies
can
have
indirect
,
but
important
consequences
for
improving
environmental
quality
.
an
example
,
would
be
local
area
computer
networks
designed
to
enhance
office
communication
,
but
which
also
reduce
paper
use
.
epa
is
interested
in
promoting
all
phases
of
technological
change
such
as
:
the
research
and
development
of
new
concepts
;
preliminary
design
testing
and
pilot
applications
of
evolving
technologies
;
performance
demonstrations
and
testing
;
evaluations
of
early
commercial
applications
;
and
diffusion
into
domestic
and
international
markets
.
the
draft
`
technology
innovation
strategy
'
outlines
the
general
principles
that
guide
epa
in
its
efforts
to
foster
innovation
in
its
existing
programs
and
new
projects
being
initiated
under
the
presidents
environmental
technology
initiative
(
see
below
.
it
outlines
four
objectives
:
1
.
adapt
epas
policy
,
regulatory
,
and
compliance
framework
to
promote
innovation
;
2
.
strengthen
the
capacity
of
technology
developers
and
users
to
succeed
in
environmental
technology
innovation
;
3
.
strategically
invest
epa
funds
in
the
development
and
commercialization
of
promising
new
technologies
;
and
,
4
.
accelerate
diffusion
of
innovative
technologies
at
home
and
abroad
.
epa
invites
comments
on
the
draft
strategy
and
the
following
questions
:
(
1
)
what
roles
are
appropriate
for
epa
to
play
in
stimulating
the
development
and
use
of
innovative
technological
solutions
to
environmental
problems
?
(
2
)
do
you
agree
with
the
strategys
objectives
and
with
epas
approaches
to
achieving
them
?
which
objectives
should
receive
the
highest
priority
for
action
?
(
3
)
are
there
additional
areas
of
emphasis
that
epa
should
address
in
planning
and
funding
its
technology
development
,
commercialization
,
and
diffusion
activities
?
(
4
)
are
there
particular
environmental
technology
needs
or
impediments
to
development
on
which
you
feel
the
agency
should
focus
more
of
its
attention
?
