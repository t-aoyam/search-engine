initiate

,
the

that

inaccurate

in

,
the

on

from

the

a

hadsons
argument
implies
that
because
a
hard
copy
of
the
form
592
information
will
not
be
filed
with
the
commission
pipelines
will
knowingly
provide
inaccurate
or
incorrect
information
through
electronic
means
.
the
commission
believes
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
broad
enough
to
cover
electronic
postings
.
however
,
in
order
to
prevent
any
such
fraudulent
conduct
,
the
commission
deems
the
electronic
posting
of
the
form
592
information
equivalent
to
a
filing
for
purposes
of
18
usc
.

.
since
contemporaneously

request
for
rehearing
ozark
asserts
that
the
commissions
order
on
remand
ignores
the
courts
instructions
requiring
the
commission
to
consider
the
effect
of
ozarks
evidence
on
the
question
of
control
.
ozark
contends
that
it
simply
relies
upon
an
equally
deficient
rationale
for
concluding
,
without
reference
to
any
evidence
,
that
tennessee
ozark
and
ozark
pipeline
corporation
each
,
individually
,
`
controls
'
ozark
,
thereby
making
the
marketing
affiliates

those
partners
marketing
affiliates
of
ozark
.
ozark
submits
that
to
avoid
problems
inherent
in
finding
that
these
partners
can
exercise
`
affirmative
control
'
over
ozark
,
the
commission
concluded
that
they
can
exercise
`
negative
control
'
by
simply
withholding
their
vote
and
vetoing
any
transportation
transaction
that
would
compete
with
their
respective
marketing
affiliates
.
