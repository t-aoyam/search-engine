a

facility
has
the
ability
to
deliver
large
amounts
of
gas
on
very
short
notice
over
brief
periods
of
time
for
use
on
occasions
,
such
as
very
cold
winter
days

very
hot
summer
days
,
when
such
increased
supplies
are
needed
to
meet
the
requirements
of
heating
or
electric
generating
customers
.
peaking
service
is
distinguishable
from
storage
service
because
storage
is
typically
designed
to
provide
meaningful
deliveries
of
natural
gas
on
a
more
frequent
basis
over
a
longer
period
of
time
,
eg
,
120
