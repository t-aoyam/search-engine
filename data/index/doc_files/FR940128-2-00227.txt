if
questions
arise
concerning
the
precise
relationship
of
specific
properties
to
noise
exposure
contours
depicted
on
a
noise
exposure
map
submitted
under
section
103
of
the
act
,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
faa
is
not
involved
in
any
way
in
determining
the
relative
locations
of
specific
properties
with
regard
to
the
depicted
noise
contours
,
or
in
interpreting
the
noise
exposure
maps
to
resolve
questions
concerning
,
for
example
,
which
properties
should
be
covered
by
the
provisions
of
section
107
of
the
act
.
these
functions
are
inseparable
from
the
ultimate
land
use
control
and
planning
responsibilities
of
local
government
.
these
local
responsibilities
are
not
changed
in
any
way
under
part
150
or
through
faas
review
of
noise
exposure
maps
.
therefore
,
the
responsibility
for
the
detailed
overlaying
of
noise
exposure
contours
onto
the
map
depicting
properties
on
the
surface
rests
exclusively
with
the
airport
operator
which
submitted
those
maps
,
or
with
those
public
agencies
and
planning
agencies
with
which
consultation
is
required
under
section
103
of
the
act
.
the
faa
has
relied
on
the
certification
by
the
airport
operator
,
under
§
150
21
of
far
part
150
,
that
the
statutorily
required
consultation
has
been
accomplished
.
the
faa
has
formally
received
the
noise
compatibility
program
for
kissimmee
municipal
airport
,
also
effective
on
01/11/1994
.
preliminary
review
of
the
submitted
material
indicates
that
it
conforms
to
the
requirements
for
the
submittal
of
noise
compatibility
programs
,
but
that
further
review
will
be
necessary
prior
to
approval
or
disapproval
of
the
program
.
the
formal
review
period
,
limited
by
law
to
a
maximum
of
180
days
,
will
be
completed
on
or
before
july
10
,
1994
.
the
faas
detailed
evaluation
will
be
conducted
under
the
provisions
of
14
cfr
part
150
,
§
150
33
.
the
primary
considerations
in
the
evaluation
process
are
whether
the
proposed
measures
may
reduce
the
level
of
aviation
safety
,
create
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
,
or
be
reasonably
consistent
with
obtaining
the
goal
of
reducing
existing
noncompatible
land
uses
and
preventing
the
introduction
of
additional
noncompatible
land
uses
.
interested
persons
are
invited
to
comment
on
the
proposed
program
with
specific
reference
to
these
factors
.
all
comments
,
other
than
those
properly
addressed
to
local
land
use
authorities
,
will
be
considered
by
the
faa
to
the
extent
practicable
.
