supplementary
information
:
the
proposed
action
is
based
on
the
findings
of
the
white
sand
integrated
resource
and
ecosystem
analysis
(
ira
.
the
white
sand
ira
is
the
first
analysis
on
the
powell
ranger
district
using
policy
direction
and
emerging
concepts
of
ecosystem
management
(
em
.
the
overriding
purpose
of
em
policy
is
to
better
blend
the
needs
of
people
and
environmental
values
so
that
national
forests
represent
diverse
,
healthy
,
productive
,
and
sustainable
ecosystems
.
the
planning
area
consists
of
approximately
40000

the
proposed
action
was
designed
to
meet
various
ecological
and
social
needs
expressed
in
the
white
sand
ira
.
proposed
action
activities
fall
into
four
broad
categories
:
vegetation
retention
,
vegetation
treatments
,
access
management
,
and
fish
habitat
enhancement
.
the
purpose
of
the
proposed
action
is
to
:
vegetation
retention
_
conserve
biological
diversity
_
retain
the
undeveloped
character
of
white
sand
scenery
vegetation
treatments
_
restore
ecosystem
function
in
firedependant
fire
dependant
forest
types
_
reduce
the
risk
of
large
fires
in
white
sand
landscape
and
improve
opportunities
for
use
of
prescribed
natural
fire
_
create
vistas
and
visually
rehabilitate
several
existing
harvest

_
implement
the
clearwater

within
the

_
enhance

trail
based
recreation
fish
habitat
enhancement
_
manage
limiting
factors
that
affect
fish
populations
in
white

streams
the
proposed
action
would
accomplish
the
following
activities
over
the
next
ten
years
:
vegetation
retention
and
treatments
_
1314
acres
of
underburning
in
firedependant
fire
dependant
vegetation
communities
,
59
acres
of
planting
understocked
seedling
stands
,
14
acres
of
precommercial
thinning
overstocked
sapling
stands
,
create
one
vista
area
for
picnicking
and
viewing
scenery
,
implement
the
following
prescriptions
for
managing
the
forest
:
704
acres
of
unevenaged
uneven
aged
regeneration
harvest
,
1313
acres
of
evenaged
even
aged
regeneration
harvest
,
55
acres
of
commercial
thinning
,
and
50
acres
of
unevenaged
uneven
aged
regeneration
harvest
with
underburning
.
these
prescriptions
would
result
in
harvest
of
about
14418
thousand
board

)
of
timber
