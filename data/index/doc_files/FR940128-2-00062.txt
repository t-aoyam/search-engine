other
alternatives
there
are
no
other
alternatives
for
shortterm
short
term
storage
of
naval
spent
fuel
which
could
be
implemented
within
the
time
frame
under
consideration
.
alternatives
which
were
considered
but
found
to
be
impractical
for
shortterm
short
term
storage
included
(
1
)
shipment
to
idaho
as
in
the
past
,
which
is
precluded
by
the
federal
district
court
injunction
;
(
2
)
storage
in
commercial
dry
storage
casks
,
which
could
not
be
procured
and
adapted
quickly
for
use
with
naval
fuel
;
and
(
3
)
storage
in
navy
or
doe
water
pools
,
which
is
precluded
in
the
shortterm
short
term
by
space
limitations
and
lack
of
the
necessary
storage
racks
.
environmental
considerations
the
impacts
of
the
three
alternatives
have
been
evaluated
both
in
terms
of
their
specific
impacts
and
the
cumulative
impacts
of
shipyard
operation
.
since
the
radioactivity
in
the
spent
fuel
is
totally
isolated
from
the
environment
in
either
the
shipping
containers
,
the
surface
ship
support
barge
,
or
in
shutdown
ships
,
shortterm
short
term
storage
under
any
of
these
alternatives
would
not
result
in
any
additional
release
of
radioactivity
under
normal
conditions
.
the
environmental
assessment
considers
several
hypothetical
accidents
involving
naval
spent
fuel
including
release
of
radioactivity
from
the
fuel
during
the
accident
.
to
summarize
,
all
of
the
overall
accident
risks
are
very
small
,
less
than
one
chance
in
10000
of
a
single
fatal
cancer
in
the
entire
population
.
while
the
numerical
results
of
the
calculations
differ
for
the
various
storage
modes
and
locations
,
the
overall
risks
are
so
small
that
accident
risks
provide
no
realistic
basis
for
selecting
among
the
alternatives
.
proposed
determination
based
on
the
information
and
analysis
in
the
environmental
assessment
,
the
naval
nuclear
propulsion
program
considers
the
no
action
alternative
not
to
constitute
a
major
federal
action
significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
the
human
environment
,
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act
.
therefore
,
the
naval
nuclear
propulsion
program
issues
this
finding
of
no
significant
impact
and
will
make
a
final
determination
following
a
30
day
public
review
period
.
