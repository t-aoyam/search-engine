part
i
.
background
studies
have
indicated
that
although
large
numbers
of
farmworkers
actively
leave
agricultural
employment
annually
,
equally
large
numbers
depend
on
continued
longterm
long
term
employment
in
agriculture
for
their
livelihood
.
for
those
seeking
to
leave
agriculture
,
programs
annually
funded
under
section
402
of
the
jtpa
offer
classroom
and
skill
training
leading
to
employment
opportunities
.
farmworkers
opting
to
remain
in
agriculture
are
dependent
on
an
agricultural
employment
system
that
is
at
times
affected
by
weather
conditions
and
changing
local
labor
market
needs
and
economic
factors
,
but
is
always
constant
in
its
unforgiving
working
conditions
and
long
term
negative
effect
on
the
farmworkers
health
and
economic
well
being
.
the
department
is
interested
in
aiding
farmworkers
seeking
employment
opportunities
and
a
future
outside
of
agriculture
,
while
at
the
same
time
stabilizing
the
farm
labor
force
by
providing
labor
market
information
and
enhancing
the
skills
and
well
being
of
farmworkers
(
and
their
dependents
)
wishing
to
remain
in
agriculture
.
the
department
of
labor
is
focusing
this
solicitation
on
demonstration
efforts
that
will
address
issues
that
directly
impact
the
daily
lives
of
farmworkersboth
seasonal
and
migrant
.
