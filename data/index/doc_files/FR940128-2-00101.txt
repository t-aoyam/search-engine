in

and
under

.
planning
for
fy
1995
is
now
underway
and
epa
is
interested
in
receiving
comments
from
the
public
on
specific
focus
areas
that
should
be
emphasized
in
funding
projects
next
year
.
these
focus
areas
may
be
within
the
broad
context
of
an
entire
technology
innovation
area
or
may
be
specific
to
one
facet
of
epas
strategy
.
an
example
of
a
broad
focus
area
recommendation
would
be
the
need
for
epa
assistance
in
all
aspects
of
encouraging
the
development
and
use
of

an
example
of
a
focus
area
recommendation
specific
to
one
part
of
the
strategy
(
eg
,
objective
2
)
would
be
the
need
for
epa
to
help
assure
the
quality
and
credibility
of

for

by
creating
more
locations
for

the
presidents
environmental
technology
initiative
in
his
state
of
the
union
speech
on
02/17/1993
,
president

outlined
a
new
initiative
to
improve
environmental
quality
and
strengthen
the
american
economy
.
the
goal
of
the
presidents
environmental
technology
initiative
(
eti
)
is
to
spur
the
development
and
use
of
more
advanced
environmental
systems
and
treatment
techniques
that
can
yield
domestic
environmental
benefits
and
increase
exports
of
american
technologies
to
other
countries
.
`
dark

'
environmental
technologies
are
being
emphasized
in
the
initiative
that
is
,
technologies
,
goods
,
and
services
whose
development
is
triggered
primarily
by
environmental
improvement
objectives
.
`
dark
green
'
technologies
include
:
products
and
services
to
monitor
and
assess
pollutant
releases
and
exposure
levels
;
innovative
technologies
which
prevent
pollution
,
control
air
and
water
pollution
levels
,
and
remediate
contaminated
soil
and
groundwater
;
and
,
manage
environmental
data
.
the
initiative
is
funded
at
$
36
million
in
fy
1994
and
,
in
the
presidents
plan
,
is
to
be
funded
at
$
80
million
in
fy
1995
,
with
overall
funding
projected
to
be
$
18
billion
over

years
.
in
approving
funding
for
fiscal
year
1994
,
the
senate
appropriations
committee
instructed
the
agency
to
develop
a
detailed
program

the

released
today
is
not
a

request
for
proposals
for

or
contracts
from
epa
.
.
it
describes
the
nature
and
scope
of
work
in
each
project
area
and
invites
interested
parties
to
contact
individual
project
managers
,
especially
if
they
are
working
on
a
similar
project
or
they
are
interested
in
becoming
a
project
partner
.
project
managers
will
,
in
turn
,
be
developing
partnerships
among
interested
parties
who
can
share
in
the
projects

by
this
approach
,
epa
is
seeking
to
engage
and
leverage
the
creativity
,
expertise
,
and
resources
of
other
government
agencies

the

in
areas
of

both
the

have
stressed
the
need
for
partnerships
that
provide
both
direct
support
to
private

innovation
and
close
coordination
with
other
federal
agencies
.
these
partnerships
may
take
many
forms
