sections

and

131
of
the
orders
'
rules
and
regulations
prescribe
procedures
governing
the
exemption
from

regulation
of
such
byproduct

.
included
in
these
procedures
are
certain
reporting
requirements
imposed
on
handlers
and
byproduct
by
product
manufacturers
to
help
ensure
that
order
requirements
and
regulations
governing
the
exemption
for
byproduct
by
product
oranges
are
being
followed
.
for
example
,
persons
who
wish
to
acquire
oranges
as
an
approved
byproducts
by
products
manufacturer
for
commercial
processing
into
byproducts
by
products
exempt
from
regulation
must
submit
an
application
to
the
committee
on
form
14
(
application
to
be
placed
on
approved
list
of
orange
byproduct
by
product
manufacturers
.
these
applications
are
referred
to
the
committees
'
compliance
department
for
investigation
and
then
,
if
appropriate
,
referred
to
the
committees
for
approval
to
be
placed
on
an
approved
list
of
byproduct
by
product
manufacturers
.
commercial
processors
are
also
required
to
submit
to
the
committees
copies
of
form
15
(
orange
diversion
report
)
which
specify
how
the
oranges
were
disposed
.
finally
,
approved
byproduct
by
product
manufacturers
were
required
to
submit
form
38
(
weekly
report
of
byproduct
by
product
oranges
)
during
the
crop
year
when
processing
is
occurring
.
the
committees
have
recommended
that
submission
of
form
38
no
longer
be
required
under
the
marketing
orders
.
submission
of
form
38
was
added
to
the
orders
'
rules
and
regulations
in
1990
because
the
committees
believed
that
the
additional
information
would
help
to
ensure
that
oranges
exempted
under
the
byproducts
by
products
exemption
did
not
enter
the
fresh
fruit
market
.
it
was
believed
that
comparisons
of
the
total
amount
of
oranges
received
by
processors
with
the
total
amount
of
byproducts
by
products
manufactured
would
give
the
committees
a
method
to
verify
that
all
oranges
received
were
manufactured
into
byproducts
by
products
.
however
,
the
committees
have
found
that
the
information
collected
on
form
38
is
not
necessary
to
ensure
compliance
with
order
requirements
.
in
addition
,
much
of
the
information
on
form
38
is
collected
on
other
reports
required
to
be
submitted
under
the
orders
.
the
committees
believe
that
submission
of
form
38
creates
an
additional
burden
on
byproduct
by
product
manufacturers
that
is
not
necessary
.
thus
,
the
committees
recommended
revising
the
orders
'
rules
and
regulations
to
discontinue
the
use
of
form
38
.
the
department
has
also
made
some
minor
modifications
to
§
907
131
and
908
131
for
the
purpose
of
clarity
.
the
second
change
that
the
committees
recommended
concerns
form
3
(
daily
manifest
report
of
oranges
subject
to
allotment
.
sections
907
71
and
908
71
of
the
orange
marketing
orders
provide
that
handlers
furnish
to
the
committees
information
regarding
cartons
of
oranges
handled
,
segregated
by
size
,
within
24
hours
of
shipment
.
handlers
must
also
indicate
whether
the
shipments
were
destined
to
points
in
the
us
.
and
alaska
or
canada
.
sections
907
141
and
908
141
of
the
orders
'
rules
and
regulations
require
handlers
to
submit
,
on
form
3
,
a
manifest
report
of
oranges
shipped
within
a
24
hour
period
.
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
interim
final
rule
,
handlers
were
required
to
include
both
truck
and
rail
car
shipments
on
form
3
.
however
,
identical
information
regarding
truck
shipments
is
submitted
by
handlers
on
form
8
(
certificate
of
assignment
of
allotment
.
according
to
the
committees
,
this
duplication
of
information
created
an
added
burden
for
handlers
and
was
not
necessary
.
thus
,
the
committees
recommended
modifying
the
orders
'
rules
and
regulations
to
require
that
handlers
only
report
rail
car
shipments
on
form
3
.
handlers
are
still
required
to
submit
rail
manifests
and
other
appropriate
documentation
to
the
committees
to
substantiate
rail
car
shipments
.
