however
,
the

committee

procedure
has
approved
the

rule
change
.
according
to
the
exchange
,
on
10/20/1992
,
the
exchange
received
a
comment
letter
from
an
exchange
specialist
in
opposition
to
the
proposed
rule
change
.
the
commentator
opposes
the
rule
change
for
several
reasons
.
specifically
,
the
commentator
states
that
the
proposed
rule
does
not
provide
for
the
protection
of
customer
orders
;
that
the
proposed
rule
is
not
necessary
because
there
is
not
a
problem
now
except
for
a
few
specialists
;
that
the
proposed
rule
will
be
subject
to
abuse
because
of
the
inability
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
crosses
are
really
agency
crosses
on
an
immediate
basis
;
that
the
exchange
should
be
encouraging
more
orders
and
less
crosses
;
and
that
,
as
a
result
of
the
new
rule
,
specialists
will
not
be
able
to
participate
,
among
other
things
.

.
<
footnote
>
the
exchange
believes
that
the
commentators
concerns
are
misplaced
.
first
,
the
proposed
rule
change
will
not
interfere
with
public
orders
in
the
book
.
customer
orders
will
continue
to
be
protected
under
the
proposed
rule
,
even
if
,
through
oversight
,
they
are
not
displaced
.
the
specialist
must
fill
a
customer
order
at
the
limited
price
even
if
an
agency
cross
takes
place
at
the
limit
price
.
this
should
also
encourage
specialists
to
be
more
efficient
in
displaying
customer
orders
.
second
,
the
proposal
will
encourage
more
institutional
trades
to
be
sent
to
the
floor
;
whether
this
will
result
in
more
revenue
to
the
exchange
is
a
secondary
consideration
.
the
proposal
will
provide
a
more
attractive
marketplace
for
institutional
orders
without
sacrificing
traditional
agency
auction
principles
.
third
,
the
potential
that
some
firms
may
abuse
the
rule
by
not
having
an
agency
order
on
both
sides
of
the
trade
is
not
an
argument
for
not
having
the
rule
.
there
are
literally
dozens
of
rules
in
place
today
which
inherently
cannot
be
surveilled
on
an
immediate
basis
to
monitor
compliance
.
if
the
exchange
finds
that
firms
are
abusing
the
rule
,
it
will
take
appropriate
action
.
lastly
,
the
proposed
rule
does
not
reduce
the
possibility
of
order
interaction
on
the
floor
.
the
specialist
is
the
only
one
who
cannot
participate
in
a
cross
if
he
is
not
displaying
his
market
at
the
cross
price
;
this
should
encourage
specialists
to
quote
their
true
markets
.
the
requirement
for
a
firm
with
agency
orders
to
cross
to
bid
or
offer
at
the
post
still
remains
and
any
other
interest
in
the
crowd
can
participate
.
it
is
only
the
specialist
who
cannot
,
unless
he
is
quoting
at
the
cross
price
or
unless
he
has
been
previously
solicited
for
his
help
.
this
is
not
a
major
departure
from
agency
auction
principles
and
should
encourage
more
orders
to
the
exchange
floor
to
participate
in
the
auction
process
.
